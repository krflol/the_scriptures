# The Criterion of Multiple Attestation and the Historicity of Jesus's Death and Resurrection: A Critical Analysis

## The Cross-Section Method: Understanding the Criterion of Multiple Attestation

In the rigorous and often contentious field of historical Jesus studies, scholars employ a set of methodological tools known as the "criteria of authenticity" to assess the probability that specific sayings or events recorded in ancient texts derive from the historical Jesus of Nazareth.1 Among these, the criterion of multiple attestation, also referred to as independent attestation or the cross-section method, stands as a foundational principle of historical inquiry.3 At its core, the criterion is an argument from probability: an event, saying, or tradition is considered more likely to be historical if it is found in multiple, independent sources.5 The underlying logic is that it is improbable for several unconnected streams of tradition to have independently invented the same detail or narrative core.3 The convergence of independent witnesses makes the hypothesis of a later fabrication by a single author or community significantly less plausible, thereby strengthening the claim to historicity and lending what scholar John Dominic Crossan terms a "formal objectivity" to the reconstructive task.8

The formal development of this criterion within New Testament scholarship is credited to F. C. Burkitt, who in 1906 sought to establish an "external test" that could provide a more objective check on the authenticity of the Jesus tradition than the subjective theological or philosophical preferences that had characterized much of the "first quest" for the historical Jesus.3 Burkitt, working within the framework of the then-emerging Two-Source Hypothesis, identified sayings of Jesus that appeared in both the Gospel of Mark and the hypothetical sayings-source Q (material common to Matthew and Luke but absent from Mark). He argued that the presence of a saying in these two independent literary streams significantly increased the confidence that it stemmed from an authentic tradition originating with Jesus himself.8

Over time, scholars such as John P. Meier and C. H. Dodd refined and expanded the application of the criterion, distinguishing between two related but distinct forms of attestation.5 The first, the

**Criteria of Multiple Sources (CMS)**, is the classic application, focusing on a saying or deed that appears in two or more independent literary sources. The potential pool of such sources has been expanded by scholars to include not only Mark and Q, but also the special traditions unique to Matthew (M) and Luke (L), the Pauline epistles, the Gospel of John, and even non-canonical and non-Christian texts like the Gospel of Thomas and the writings of Josephus.3 The second form, the

**Criteria of Multiple Forms (CMF)**, adds another layer of validation. The force of the argument for historicity is increased if a particular theme or motif is found across different literary genres or forms, such as parables, miracle stories, aphorisms, creeds, dialogues, and prophetic sayings.3 For instance, the centrality of the Kingdom of God in Jesus's message is considered highly probable because it is attested not only in multiple sources (e.g., Mark, Q, L) but also across a wide array of literary forms, including parables, beatitudes, and prayers.5 The presence of a theme in such diverse forms suggests it was a deeply embedded and pervasive element of the earliest tradition, not merely the literary creation of a single author or the characteristic of a single genre.

The entire edifice of this criterion, however, rests upon the crucial and often precarious assumption of genuine source **independence**. This is a point of immense methodological significance that cannot be overstated. A tradition that appears in the gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke is not an instance of triple attestation. According to the dominant scholarly theory of gospel origins, the Two-Source Hypothesis, both Matthew and Luke used Mark's Gospel as a primary narrative source. Therefore, material common to all three (the "triple tradition") represents only a single line of attestation: that of Mark.3 To satisfy the criterion, a tradition must be attested in sources that are causally and literarily independent of one another. This means they must not have copied from each other or from a single, immediate common source.10 True multiple attestation, therefore, requires finding a tradition in separate streams, such as in Mark

_and_ in the Q source, or in Paul's letters _and_ in the Gospel of John, or in a Synoptic tradition _and_ in the writings of Josephus.3 The determination of such independence is a complex task, deeply entangled in the ongoing scholarly debate over the literary relationships among the early Christian writings.

## A Contested Tool: Methodological Challenges and Scholarly Critiques

While the criterion of multiple attestation offers a veneer of objectivity, its application is fraught with methodological complexities and has been the subject of intense scholarly critique. It is not a magic wand that can cleanly separate historical fact from theological embellishment, but rather a tool of probability whose effectiveness is contingent upon a series of debated hypotheses and whose results must be interpreted with considerable nuance.11

The most significant vulnerability of the criterion is its profound dependence on a particular solution to the **Synoptic Problem**—the question of the literary relationship between the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke.12 The standard application of multiple attestation in historical Jesus research presupposes the validity of the Two-Source Hypothesis, which posits that Matthew and Luke independently used both Mark and the hypothetical sayings source Q.14 This model provides the very definition of "independence" for much of the Synoptic material. However, the authority of the criterion is not intrinsic; it is derived entirely from the perceived strength of this underlying source-critical theory. If the Two-Source Hypothesis is incorrect, then many conclusions based on multiple attestation collapse. Mark Goodacre, a prominent critic of the Q hypothesis, has argued persuasively that Luke may well have known and used Matthew's Gospel. If this is the case, then a saying found in both Matthew and Luke (and not in Mark), previously considered a powerful "double attestation" from the independent source Q, becomes nothing more than Luke's borrowing from Matthew. The two independent witnesses merge into one, and the multiple attestation vanishes.14 This demonstrates that an argument for historicity based on multiple attestation is only as strong as the highly technical and perpetually contested argument for the independence of the sources being cited. The criterion's conclusions are not bedrock facts but are built upon the shifting sands of source-critical theory.

A second major limitation is the **problem of a common, contaminated source**. Even when genuine independence between later documents can be established (e.g., between Paul and Mark), the criterion can only trace a tradition back to the point where those sources diverge. It cannot guarantee the historicity of their common ancestor. As numerous scholars, including Bart Ehrman, have pointed out, a compelling story or saying could have been invented very early in the Christian movement—perhaps within the first decade—and disseminated so effectively that it independently entered the various streams of oral and written tradition that would later be captured by our extant sources.3 In such a scenario, multiple attestation would give the powerful illusion of historical confirmation, when in fact it only confirms the tradition's antiquity and its popularity within the nascent church.17 The analogy of a UFO sighting is apt: multiple independent reports that a strange object was seen in the sky confirm only that multiple people saw an object they could not identify; they do not, by themselves, confirm that the object was an alien spacecraft.17 Similarly, multiple attestations confirm that a story about Jesus was circulating early and widely, but they do not, in isolation, prove that the story is a factual report of an actual event.

Furthermore, a simplistic application of the criterion creates a **paradoxical relationship with other critical tools**, particularly the criterion of embarrassment. The criterion of embarrassment gives greater weight to material that would have been awkward, problematic, or theologically inconvenient for the early church, the logic being that such material is unlikely to have been invented and must have been preserved because it was too well-known to be suppressed.5 The criterion of multiple attestation, by contrast, values material that was popular and widespread. A tension immediately becomes apparent. A tradition that is embarrassing is, by its nature, less likely to be popular and widely repeated; early Christian communities, like any group, would have had a natural tendency to smooth out rough edges and omit uncongenial material from their teaching and preaching.19 Conversely, a tradition that was theologically useful or inspiring was far more likely to be repeated, preserved, and incorporated into multiple traditions, but its very utility could be the reason for its invention. This creates a potential inverse relationship: the most highly attested traditions may be the least embarrassing (and thus potentially more suspect of creative development), while the most embarrassing traditions may be the most likely to be only singly attested.19 This dynamic demands a far more sophisticated historiographical approach than simply counting sources. The historian must weigh the qualitative nature of the attestation, where a single, awkward, and difficult attestation might carry more historical weight than three independent but theologically polished and convenient ones.

Finally, it is crucial to understand the criterion's proper function. The criteria of authenticity are best used as **positive tools for confirmation, not as negative tools for negation**.3 If a saying or event meets the standard of multiple attestation, its claim to historicity is strengthened. However, if a tradition is only singly attested, that failure does not prove it is unhistorical.8 It may simply mean that the tradition was preserved in only one of the streams that survived. Some of the most profound or unique aspects of Jesus's ministry might well have been preserved by only a single evangelist.8 An overly rigid negative application, such as that sometimes attributed to John Dominic Crossan, who has been criticized for refusing to consider any singly attested material, risks creating a minimalist and distorted portrait of Jesus based only on what was most popular, rather than the full breadth of the traditions about him.20

## Application to the Crucifixion: A Case of Broad Consensus

When the criterion of multiple attestation is applied to the claim of Jesus's death by crucifixion under the authority of the Roman prefect Pontius Pilate, it yields one of the most secure and widely accepted conclusions in the study of ancient history. The event is attested by a remarkable convergence of sources that are not only numerous but also diverse in their origin, genre, and perspective, creating a cumulative case that even the most skeptical of critical historians find compelling.

### Early Christian Sources

The attestation to the crucifixion is embedded in the earliest and most foundational strata of the Christian tradition, long before the narrative Gospels were compiled.

The earliest written evidence for Jesus's death comes from the **Pauline Epistles**. The letters of Paul, written largely in the 50s AD, predate the composition of the Gospels by at least one to two decades.21 Throughout his writings, Paul treats the crucifixion not as a recent discovery or a debatable point, but as the absolute, non-negotiable bedrock of the Christian proclamation (e.g., 1 Corinthians 1:23, 2:2; Galatians 3:1). His testimony is made even more powerful by his quotation of what is almost universally recognized as a

**pre-Pauline creed** in 1 Corinthians 15:3-5. Paul introduces this summary of the gospel with the technical rabbinic terms for transmitting sacred tradition: "For what I _received_ I _passed on_ to you...".22 Scholars across the ideological spectrum agree that Paul is here quoting a formula that was already fixed and circulating in the church before his own apostolic career began in earnest.22 Based on Paul's own chronology in Galatians, he likely "received" this tradition during his visit to the Jerusalem apostles Peter and James around 36 AD, a mere handful of years after the event itself.24 The creed begins with the unambiguous statement, "that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures".27 This source pushes attestation for the death of Jesus back to the very origins of the Christian movement in Jerusalem, within the living memory of eyewitnesses.26

The **Canonical Gospels** provide further, narrative attestation. All four Gospels—Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John—conclude their accounts of Jesus's ministry with a detailed narrative of his passion and crucifixion.3 While the Synoptic Gospels (Matthew, Mark, and Luke) are literarily dependent, they are not monolithic. The passion narrative in Mark is widely considered to be a cohesive and very early source block that the author incorporated into his Gospel.24 Furthermore, the Gospel of John provides a passion narrative that contains a great deal of unique material and is broadly held to be literarily independent of the Synoptics. The fact that this climactic event is central to both the Synoptic tradition and the independent Johannine tradition constitutes a significant instance of multiple attestation within the Gospel genre itself.29

### Non-Christian (Secular) Sources

The historical case for the crucifixion is dramatically fortified by corroboration from several non-Christian sources from the late first and early second centuries. These authors, who were either neutral or actively hostile toward the burgeoning Christian movement, had no theological motivation to invent or affirm the ignominious death of its founder. Their testimony provides powerful external verification.

The most significant Roman source is the historian **Cornelius Tacitus**. Writing around 116 AD in his _Annals_, Tacitus recounts Nero's persecution of Christians following the great fire of Rome in 64 AD. In explaining who these "Christians" were, he states: "Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus".30 Tacitus's disdainful tone, referring to Christianity as a "most mischievous superstition," makes it exceptionally unlikely that he was simply repeating Christian propaganda.33 His report is considered by scholars to be a valuable, independent, and authentic confirmation of the core historical data: the name of the founder, the method of his death ("the extreme penalty" being a Roman euphemism for crucifixion), the Roman official who ordered it, and the time period.30

The most important Jewish source is the first-century historian **Flavius Josephus**. In his work _Antiquities of the Jews_ (c. 93-94 AD), Josephus refers to Jesus on two occasions. The more famous passage, known as the _Testimonium Flavianum_, describes Jesus as a wise man and teacher who "won over many of the Jews and many of the Gentiles." It then states, "And when Pilate, at the suggestion of the principal men amongst us, had condemned him to the cross, those that loved him at the first did not forsake him".35 While there is a near-universal scholarly consensus that this passage was later altered by Christian scribes who added overtly Christian affirmations (e.g., "He was [the] Christ," and references to the resurrection), there is an equally broad consensus that an authentic, neutral core from Josephus remains.30 This original nucleus is believed to have attested to Jesus's existence, his teaching, and, crucially, his execution by crucifixion under Pilate.39 A second, undisputed passage in Josephus's work describes the execution of "James, the brother of Jesus who was called the Christ," which provides independent, indirect confirmation of Jesus's historical existence and his association with the title "Christ".35

Further, albeit less detailed, attestations from non-Christian writers provide additional corroboration:

- **Lucian of Samosata**, a second-century Greek satirist, mocked Christians for continuing to worship "the man who was crucified in Palestine for introducing this new cult into the world".30 The presence of factual errors in Lucian's understanding of Christian beliefs suggests his information was not derived directly from Christian sources, strengthening its claim to independence.30
    
- **Mara bar Serapion**, a Syrian Stoic philosopher writing a letter to his son sometime after 73 AD, reflects on the folly of persecuting wise men, citing the examples of Socrates, Pythagoras, and the "wise king" whom the Jews executed, asking what advantage they gained from it, seeing that their kingdom was destroyed soon after. This is widely understood as a reference to Jesus.30
    
- **The Babylonian Talmud**, a collection of Jewish rabbinical law and lore containing traditions from the period of 70-200 AD, includes a passage stating that on "the eve of the Passover, Yeshu was hanged".38 In this context, "hanged" is a known synonym for crucifixion (cf. Galatians 3:13). The passage's hostile context—accusing Jesus of sorcery and apostasy—makes it a powerful attestation from an antagonistic source that the event itself, the execution, did in fact happen.38
    

### Synthesis and Conclusion: An Unimpeachable Fact

The convergence of these multiple, independent sources is historiographically overwhelming. The death of Jesus by crucifixion under Pontius Pilate is attested in Christian creeds from the 30s AD, in multiple independent Gospel traditions, and by Roman, Jewish, and Syrian writers who were variously neutral, satirical, or hostile to the Christian faith. The data comes from different genres (creed, letter, biography, history, satire, legal code) and from different geographical locations across the Roman Empire. This wide and deep attestation has led to a firm and nearly universal consensus among historians of all backgrounds. As the atheist New Testament scholar Gerd Lüdemann states, "Jesus' death as a consequence of crucifixion is indisputable".29 Bart Ehrman concurs: "One of the most certain facts of history is that Jesus was crucified on orders of the Roman prefect of Judea, Pontius Pilate".29

This broad consensus reveals a crucial aspect of how the criterion of multiple attestation functions in practice. The sources for the crucifixion are qualitatively different from those for the resurrection. The crucifixion is attested by both insiders (Christians) and outsiders (Romans, Jews), many of whom were hostile and had no reason to invent the embarrassing execution of the Christians' leader. The resurrection, by contrast, is attested _only_ by insiders. This fundamental asymmetry in the evidence base is the primary reason for the stark difference in scholarly conclusions. Multiple attestation for the crucifixion points to a public event, known and reported by followers and opponents alike. Multiple attestation for the resurrection, as will be explored, points to a belief that originated and spread _within_ the believing community. The criterion, therefore, yields a high degree of historical certainty for the death of Jesus, but a high degree of scholarly debate for the claims made about what happened next.

## Application to the Resurrection: A Case of Contested Interpretation

When the criterion of multiple attestation is applied to the resurrection of Jesus, the scholarly landscape shifts dramatically from broad consensus to contested interpretation. Unlike the crucifixion, which is a public event corroborated by external and even hostile sources, the resurrection is an event attested exclusively by sources from within the early Christian movement. The criterion powerfully establishes that the _belief_ in Jesus's resurrection is not a late-developing legend but was the explosive, foundational conviction of the very first followers, attested in the earliest and most diverse layers of the New Testament tradition. However, the criterion itself cannot adjudicate the central question that divides scholars: what was the nature of the event that gave rise to this belief? Was it a historical, bodily event? A series of subjective, visionary experiences? Or a powerful theological metaphor?

### Attesting the Core Proclamation: The 1 Corinthians 15 Creed

The starting point for any historical investigation of the resurrection is the ancient creedal formula preserved by Paul in 1 Corinthians 15:3-8. Its evidential value is immense due to its extraordinary antiquity. There is a near-universal scholarly consensus, shared by conservative, liberal, and skeptical scholars alike (including Bart Ehrman and Gerd Lüdemann), that this is a pre-Pauline tradition that Paul "received" from the Jerusalem church leaders who preceded him.22 Its formulation is dated by most scholars to within a few years, and by some to within mere months, of Jesus's death (c. 30-35 AD).24 This text is not Paul's own composition but a window into the crystallized beliefs of the Jerusalem community, led by Peter (Cephas) and James, at a time when the events were fresh and eyewitnesses were the primary source of information.26

The creed attests to a structured sequence of four core claims, each introduced by the word "that" (_hoti_):

1. That Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,
    
2. That he was buried,
    
3. That he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures,
    
4. And that he appeared to Cephas, then to the Twelve.
    

Paul then continues, possibly extending the traditional list, with appearances to "more than five hundred of the brothers and sisters at the same time," "to James, then to all the apostles," and finally, "to me also".22 The stylized, parallel structure of the first four clauses suggests it was a carefully crafted formula designed for easy memorization, teaching, and liturgical recitation.44

From the perspective of multiple attestation, this creed is a goldmine. It provides a single, exceptionally early source that itself attests to multiple appearances to different recipients: an individual (Peter), the core leadership group (the Twelve), a larger community (the 500), and a key family member who was previously a skeptic (James). It firmly establishes that the _proclamation_ of post-mortem appearances was not a peripheral idea but the central, foundational content of the earliest gospel message, rooted in the original apostolic circle in Jerusalem.22

### Attesting the Narratives: The Empty Tomb and Appearances in the Gospels

The four Gospels provide narrative accounts that flesh out the spare, creedal claims of 1 Corinthians 15. Applying the criterion of multiple attestation to these narratives is complicated by their literary interdependencies, yet scholars have identified several distinct strands of tradition that appear to corroborate the core events.

The **empty tomb** narrative, where a group of women followers discover Jesus's tomb vacant on the Sunday morning after his crucifixion, is a key feature of the Gospel accounts. Proponents of its historicity, such as philosopher William Lane Craig, argue for a strong case from multiple attestation, identifying at least six independent sources for the tradition.46 These include: the pre-Markan passion narrative, which likely concluded with the empty tomb story 24; Matthew's independent source material (M), evidenced by the unique story of the guard at the tomb, which contains non-Matthean vocabulary and reflects an early Jewish-Christian polemic 46; Luke's independent source material (L), evidenced by the account of Peter visiting the tomb to verify the women's report, an incident also found in the independent Gospel of John 46; the Gospel of John's own distinct empty tomb narrative 46; the early apostolic sermons in the book of Acts, which contrast the occupied tomb of David with the implicit emptiness of Jesus's tomb 46; and the logical implication of the "he was buried... he was raised" formula in the 1 Corinthians 15 creed, which for a first-century Jew would presuppose a vacant grave.24

The post-mortem **appearances** are likewise attested in multiple, seemingly independent narrative traditions within the Gospels, corroborating the list in 1 Corinthians 15. For example, an appearance to Peter is independently attested by Luke (Luke 24:34) and Paul (1 Corinthians 15:5). An appearance to the core group of disciples (the Twelve) is independently attested by Luke (Luke 24:36-49), John (John 20:19-23), and Paul (1 Corinthians 15:5). Appearances to the women are attested independently by Matthew (Matthew 28:9-10) and John (John 20:11-18).24 The table below organizes this complex data to illustrate both the points of convergence (multiple attestation) and divergence (details of location, timing, and nature of the encounters).

|**Source**|**Recipient(s) of Appearance**|**Location of Appearance**|**Nature of Appearance**|**Key Discrepancies/Unique Elements**|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**1 Corinthians 15:3-8 (Creed)**|Cephas (Peter), the Twelve, >500 brethren, James, all the apostles, Paul|Unspecified|Mentioned as an "appearance" (_ōphthē_)|Earliest list; includes appearance to 500 and James; no women mentioned.|
|**Mark 16:1-8 (Original Ending)**|None described|Angel at tomb promises appearance in Galilee|No appearances occur in the original text.|Ends abruptly with women fleeing in fear and silence.|
|**Matthew 28**|Mary Magdalene & the other Mary; The Eleven Disciples|At the tomb (Jerusalem); A mountain in Galilee|Physical (they clasp his feet); Conversation; Great Commission.|Includes the story of the guards at the tomb and the Jewish polemic of the stolen body. Focuses on the Galilean appearance.|
|**Luke 24**|Two disciples on the road; Simon (Peter); The Eleven and others|Road to Emmaus; Jerusalem|Unrecognized at first; Eats food (broiled fish); Teaches from scripture; Commissioning; Ascension from Bethany.|All appearances are strictly in and around Jerusalem; no mention of Galilee. Emphasizes physical proof (eating, handling).|
|**John 20-21**|Mary Magdalene; The disciples (without Thomas); The disciples (with Thomas); Seven disciples|At the tomb (Jerusalem); A locked room (Jerusalem); By the Sea of Tiberias (Galilee)|Conversation; Physical proof (Thomas touches wounds); Breathes Holy Spirit; Eats breakfast with them.|Includes both Jerusalem and Galilean appearances. Contains unique episodes with Mary Magdalene and "doubting Thomas."|
|**Acts 1**|The apostles|Mount of Olives (near Jerusalem)|Conversation over 40 days; Commissioning; Ascension.|Provides a 40-day timeframe for the appearances before the ascension.|

This comparative analysis highlights the interpretive challenge. While multiple sources attest to appearances to Peter and the Twelve, they disagree on the location (Galilee vs. Jerusalem) and other crucial details. This leads scholars to three distinct interpretive pathways.

### The Historical Inference: The Case for Bodily Resurrection

A significant number of scholars, including N. T. Wright, William Lane Craig, Michael Licona, and Gary Habermas, argue that the best historical explanation for the multiply attested data is that Jesus was literally and bodily raised from the dead.24 This argument, often framed as the "minimal facts approach," begins by establishing a set of core historical data points that are granted by a wide consensus of scholars, including many skeptics.48 These facts typically include:

1. Jesus died by crucifixion.
    
2. His disciples sincerely believed that he rose and appeared to them.
    
3. The church persecutor, Paul, was suddenly changed by an experience he believed was an appearance of the risen Jesus.
    
4. The skeptic James, Jesus's brother, was suddenly changed and became a leader of the Jerusalem church after a similar experience.
    
5. The tomb in which Jesus was buried was found empty.
    

Proponents of this view argue that the "Resurrection Hypothesis" provides the best explanation for this collection of multiply attested facts.52 Alternative naturalistic theories are deemed insufficient. The

**hallucination theory**, for example, struggles to account for the group appearances (as hallucinations are typically individual experiences), the conversion of a hostile persecutor like Paul, and, most significantly, the empty tomb.53 The

**conspiracy theory** (that the disciples stole the body) fails to explain their genuine transformation from fearful deserters to bold proclaimers willing to suffer and die for their belief; people may die for what they believe to be true, but they are unlikely to die for what they know to be a lie.52 Therefore, by a process of inference to the best explanation, the bodily resurrection is posited as the most plausible historical cause for the evidence.

### The Historical Belief: The Case for Visionary Experiences

A second group of scholars, including prominent skeptics like Bart Ehrman and Gerd Lüdemann, accepts the force of multiple attestation in proving that the disciples had powerful, transformative experiences that they sincerely _believed_ were appearances of the risen Jesus.53 However, this school of thought interprets the object of this attestation not as an external, physical event, but as an internal, subjective experience best understood as a vision or a grief-induced hallucination.55

Gerd Lüdemann, for example, has developed a detailed psychological reconstruction. He posits that Peter, overwhelmed by guilt for his denial of Jesus, experienced a powerful, psychologically-induced vision of a forgiving Jesus. This profound personal experience resolved his guilt and convinced him that Jesus was alive. Peter then shared his experience with the other demoralized disciples, creating a "chain reaction" of conviction and, in some cases, similar visionary experiences.55 Bart Ehrman proposes a slightly different path, arguing that the disciples, grappling with the trauma of the crucifixion, turned to the Jewish scriptures and came to believe that God must have vindicated Jesus by exalting him to heaven. This new theological belief then created a state of heightened expectation, leading some believers to have visions of the now-exalted Jesus. These initial, non-physical visionary experiences were then narrated, embellished, and gradually concretized over decades of oral tradition, eventually resulting in the more physical appearance stories found in the later Gospels.58 In this view, multiple attestation does not confirm a historical miracle; it confirms the historical reality and rapid spread of a powerful new

_religious experience_ that founded Christianity.

### The Theological Metaphor: The Case for Parabolic Meaning

A third approach, represented by scholars such as John Dominic Crossan and the late Marcus Borg, brackets the historical question of "what really happened" to Jesus's physical body. Instead, they interpret the multiply attested resurrection stories primarily as theological statements or parables, whose truth lies in their meaning rather than their literal facticity.59

John Dominic Crossan argues that "resurrection" was a powerful metaphor for the disciples' profound conviction that Jesus's mission and message—his proclamation of the Kingdom of God—had been vindicated by God and continued to be powerfully present in their community, despite his execution by the Roman Empire.59 The stories of the empty tomb and appearances are not, in his view, historical reports but parables crafted to communicate this theological truth. Similarly, Marcus Borg contended that the essential meaning of Easter is not about a spectacular past event concerning a corpse, but about two present realities: "Jesus lives" (he is a present reality to be experienced) and "Jesus is Lord" (he is vindicated by God over the worldly powers that killed him).63 For these scholars, the multiple attestations in the early sources demonstrate the absolute centrality of this

_theological conviction_ to the earliest Christians. The stories are true in the way a parable is true—they convey profound meaning about God and the world—but they are not intended as literal, historical journalism.

The stark divergence between these three schools of thought reveals a critical insight. A remarkable number of scholars across the spectrum, from William Lane Craig to Bart Ehrman to Dale Allison, can agree on a common "bedrock" of multiply attested data: Jesus's death, followed by the sudden, sincere, and transformative belief of his followers that he had appeared to them alive.52 The disagreement is not primarily over this core evidence. The debate is fundamentally interpretive. It centers on the

_explanation_ for that evidence. One group infers a miracle, another infers a psychological phenomenon, and a third infers a metaphorical meaning. The criterion of multiple attestation is powerful enough to establish the historical phenomena that demand an explanation. However, the criterion itself is neutral on the nature of that explanation. It brings the historian to the evidence, but it cannot force a conclusion.

## Concluding Analysis: The Power and Limits of Multiple Attestation

The application of the criterion of multiple attestation to the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ provides a masterful case study in both the power and the profound limitations of historical methodology when confronting claims that intersect with the transcendent. The analysis reveals that the criterion does not function as a monolithic tool yielding uniform results, but rather as a sensitive instrument whose readings depend entirely on the nature of the data being examined. The outcome for the crucifixion is one of historical certainty; the outcome for the resurrection is one of historical ambiguity and interpretive impasse.

The crucifixion of Jesus under Pontius Pilate stands as a fact of history established to a high degree of probability, in large part due to the force of multiple attestation. The convergence of evidence from early and independent Christian traditions (Pauline creeds, Synoptic sources, the Johannine tradition) with the corroborating testimony of non-Christian and even hostile sources (Tacitus, Josephus, Lucian, the Talmud) creates a powerful cumulative case. The event was public, its consequences were known to friend and foe alike, and its attestation cuts across the boundaries of belief and unbelief. Here, the criterion functions at its most effective, building a bridge of probability strong enough to carry nearly all historians, regardless of their theological or philosophical commitments, to the same conclusion.

In stark contrast, the resurrection presents a case where the sources are exclusively internal to the believing community. Multiple attestation powerfully demonstrates that the belief in Jesus's post-mortem appearances was not a late-developing legend that grew over generations, as was once commonly argued.53 The criterion pushes the origin of this belief back to the very beginning of the Christian movement, to the earliest apostolic community in Jerusalem, within months or years of Jesus's death. It confirms that

_something_ profound, powerful, and transformative occurred in the weeks following the crucifixion that convinced a group of demoralized followers—and later, skeptics like James and enemies like Paul—that Jesus of Nazareth was alive and exalted by God.

This is the crucial point where the criterion reaches its limit. It successfully identifies the historical problem with remarkable clarity: what was the catalyst for this sudden, explosive, and counter-intuitive belief? But it cannot, by itself, provide the solution. The data it authenticates—a widespread, sincere, and transformative belief in the resurrection—is a historical phenomenon. The cause of that phenomenon, however, remains a matter of interpretation, and the choice of interpretation is decisively shaped by the historian's own methodological and philosophical presuppositions.

The historian who operates within a framework that allows for supernatural intervention can see the multiply attested evidence as pointing to the resurrection as the most adequate and historically plausible explanation (the view of Wright and Craig). The historian who adheres to methodological naturalism will accept the sincerity of the disciples' experiences but will necessarily seek a cause within the realm of known human phenomena, such as psychology and sociology (the view of Ehrman and Lüdemann). The historian who prioritizes literary and theological meaning over event-based causality will interpret the stories as powerful metaphors articulating the faith of the early community (the view of Crossan and Borg).

Ultimately, the criterion of multiple attestation serves as an indispensable tool. It clears away the untenable hypothesis of late legendary accretion and focuses the debate squarely on the nature of the earliest Christian experience. It can show us the smoke rising from first-century Palestine with undeniable clarity. It can confirm the testimony of multiple, independent witnesses who all claim to have seen a fire. But it cannot, by its own power, compel a consensus on whether that fire was of natural or supernatural origin. The final verdict depends less on the tool itself and more on the worldview of the one who wields it.
