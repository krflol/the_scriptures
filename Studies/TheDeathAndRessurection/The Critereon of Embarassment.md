# A Historical Inquiry into the Death and Resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth: An Analysis of the Criterion of Embarrassment and Extrabiblical Sources

## Part I: Methodological Foundations in Historical Jesus Research

### Section 1.1: The Criterion of Embarrassment as a Historiographical Tool

#### Definition and Logic

In the rigorous discipline of historical-critical analysis, particularly within New Testament studies, scholars employ a set of tools known as the "criteria of authenticity" to assess the probability that certain sayings or events recorded in the Gospels trace back to the historical Jesus. Among these, the criterion of embarrassment stands as a particularly compelling, if complex, instrument of inquiry. The fundamental logic of this criterion is that a historical account is more likely to be authentic if its contents would have been awkward, counter-productive, or embarrassing for the author or the community for which they were writing. The core assumption is that early Christian authors, engaged in propagating a new faith, would have a natural inclination to present their founder and foundational figures in the best possible light. Consequently, they would be expected to suppress or soften any historical material that might weaken their theological positions, create difficulties in apologetic debates with opponents, or otherwise cause shame. When such potentially damaging material is included, it suggests that the author felt constrained by a tenacious and well-known tradition that they were not at liberty to alter or omit. This principle is logically analogous to the legal concept of a "declaration against interest," where a statement that exposes the speaker to liability is considered more credible because one would not invent such a self-damaging claim.

The power of this criterion lies in its appeal to basic human and organizational psychology. Propagandists, hagiographers, and founders of movements do not typically invent stories that make their heroes appear weak, their core beliefs questionable, or their foundational leaders look foolish and cowardly. When such elements are present in the foundational texts of a movement, it signals to the historian that these are not likely to be late, laudatory inventions but may instead be stubborn historical facts that the tradition had to incorporate and explain, rather than invent.

#### Intellectual History

The criterion of embarrassment is not a recent apologetic invention but a long-standing tool within the academic field of New Testament research. While the specific phrase was popularized in the late 20th century by the influential scholar John P. Meier in his work

_A Marginal Jew_, he attributed the term to the theologian Edward Schillebeeckx. Although Schillebeeckx discussed the mechanics of the criterion without using the exact term, the conceptual underpinnings of the approach are much older. The earliest formulation of this type of analysis is often traced to the German scholar Paul Wilhelm Schmiedel in his article on the Gospels for the

_Encyclopaedia Biblica_ in 1899. This long pedigree within critical scholarship establishes the criterion as a legitimate, albeit debated, method for historical inquiry, distinct from purely faith-based arguments. Its use is intended to move beyond theological presuppositions to assess the historical plausibility of the Gospel traditions based on the internal evidence of the texts themselves.

#### Standard Applications

The utility of the criterion of embarrassment is best understood through its application to specific Gospel narratives that presented clear theological difficulties for the early church.

**The Baptism of Jesus by John:** This is perhaps the most frequently cited example of the criterion's application. All the Synoptic Gospels record that Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist. This event created a significant theological problem. John's movement was centered on a "baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins". For Jesus, whom the early church proclaimed as the sinless Son of God, to submit to such a baptism implied that he was in need of repentance and forgiveness, and it positioned him in a subordinate role to John. This narrative detail was not helpful for a community arguing for Jesus's superiority and unique status. The Gospel of Mark, the earliest of the four, presents the event starkly and without any theological explanation, suggesting it was a known and accepted fact. The later Gospels reveal the growing "embarrassment" with this tradition. Matthew's account has John the Baptist protest, saying, "I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?" Jesus then provides a theological justification: "Let it be so now; for it is proper for us in this way to fulfill all righteousness" (Matthew 3:14-15). This addition is a clear attempt to resolve the theological awkwardness of the event. Luke, meanwhile, minimizes the event by placing the notice of Jesus's baptism after his description of John's imprisonment, effectively removing John from the immediate scene. Finally, the Gospel of John, the latest of the canonical Gospels, omits the baptism event altogether, having John the Baptist simply bear witness to the Spirit descending on Jesus. This developmental trajectory from stark report to theological explanation to omission strongly suggests that the baptism was a historical event that the early church could not deny but had to progressively reinterpret and manage as its Christology developed.

**The Ignorance and Failures of the Disciples:** Another powerful application of the criterion relates to the consistent portrayal of Jesus's closest followers. The Gospels, which were the foundational documents for a new religious movement, depict its future leaders—the Apostles—in a remarkably unflattering light. They are frequently shown as clueless, failing to understand Jesus's parables and teachings, and possessing a marked lack of faith. They are portrayed as petty and self-serving, arguing amongst themselves about which of them is the greatest, even as Jesus predicts his own suffering and death. This behavior culminates in their utter failure during the Passion: Judas betrays Jesus, Peter denies him three times after vowing loyalty, and all the others abandon him and flee.

From a propagandistic perspective, this is a disastrous way to portray the foundational pillars of the church. One would expect a later, fabricated account to depict the Apostles as heroic, insightful, and steadfast from the beginning in order to bolster their authority and the credibility of the movement they founded. The consistent inclusion of their profound flaws and failures lends the narratives a strong sense of verisimilitude—the quality of appearing real and uninvented. The authors seem to be reporting traditions about real, flawed human beings rather than creating idealized archetypes. This suggests that the memory of the disciples' failures was too deeply embedded in the tradition to be sanitized.

### Section 1.2: A Critical Appraisal of the Criterion of Embarrassment

Despite its intuitive appeal, the criterion of embarrassment is subject to significant scholarly criticism and must be applied with caution. Its limitations prevent it from being a definitive test for historicity, and it is almost always used in concert with other criteria of authenticity.

#### Scholarly Critiques and Limitations

A nuanced understanding of historical methodology requires a thorough engagement with the weaknesses of any analytical tool. The criterion of embarrassment is no exception, and scholars have identified several key limitations.

**Anachronism and Context:** A primary objection is the difficulty of accurately assessing what would have been embarrassing in a first-century Judeo-Roman context from a twenty-first-century perspective. Social and theological sensitivities change dramatically over time. What seems awkward to a modern reader may have served a specific and non-embarrassing function for the original audience. For example, some critics argue that narratives like Jesus's family initially disbelieving in him could be a deliberate rhetorical strategy to make his message more palatable to outsiders ("See, not even his family believed at first, so your skepticism is understandable"). Similarly, the "at first, no one believed us" trope is a common feature in the literature of new religious movements and can serve to frame the group as an underdog that ultimately triumphs, rather than being a genuine source of shame.

**The "Embarrassment" Misnomer:** Reflecting the concern over anachronistic psychological judgments, many scholars, including Mark Goodacre and E. P. Sanders, have argued that the term "embarrassment" itself is problematic. It incorrectly implies that the evangelists were sitting at their desks with red faces, fidgeting uncomfortably as they dictated these stories. This kind of pop-psychology is unhelpful. These scholars suggest replacing the term with a more precise concept, such as "against the grain" or "criterion of contradiction". This reframing shifts the focus from the author's supposed emotional state to a more objective textual question: Does this particular tradition run contrary to the author's clear theological agenda or apologetic purpose as evidenced elsewhere in the work? This formulation is less speculative and provides a more rigorous basis for analysis.

**Potential for Didactic Invention:** What appears to be an embarrassing detail may, in fact, be an intentionally created account designed to serve a didactic or theological purpose. A prime example is Peter's denial of Jesus. While it is certainly embarrassing for the "rock" upon whom the church would be built, it also functions as a powerful cautionary tale. It vividly illustrates the consequences of disowning Jesus, a theme Jesus himself addresses in his teachings: "But whoever disowns me before men, I will disown him before my Father in heaven" (Matthew 10:33). The story could have been crafted as a dramatic lesson for the community about the danger of apostasy under pressure and the possibility of restoration through repentance.

**The Fallacy of False Dichotomy:** The criterion can be criticized for creating a false dichotomy, implying that an author's only options are either to be compelled by fact to report an embarrassing event or to invent an embarrassing fiction. This overlooks several other possibilities. An author could simply omit the detail, as Luke appears to have done with some of Mark's more difficult stories. Another possibility is that the embarrassing detail included in the text is a substitution for an even more embarrassing truth that has been suppressed. For instance, one could hypothetically argue that Peter's denial, while damaging, was included as a less-damaging alternative to an even greater misdeed that was expunged from the record.

**The Tension with Multiple Attestation:** A significant logical challenge arises when an "embarrassing" tradition is also multiply attested—that is, it appears in multiple independent sources. As scholar Mark Goodacre notes, it seems "bonkers to have embarrassments that are multiply attested". If a detail were truly so counter-productive, one would expect it to be suppressed by at least some of the independent traditions. The fact that it survives across different streams of the tradition (e.g., the baptism of Jesus in Mark, Q, and John's tradition) suggests that it was either not considered deeply embarrassing by the earliest Christian communities or, more likely, that it was so central and foundational to the story of Jesus that it simply could not be ignored or excised. This suggests the tradition's tenacity, but it complicates the simple logic of the criterion.

#### Conclusion on Method

The scholarly consensus is that the criterion of embarrassment cannot be used mechanistically as a simple proof of historicity. Its invocation is not sufficient, in and of itself, to establish an event or saying as historical. The numerous limitations—the danger of anachronism, the possibility of didactic purpose, and the logical tension with other criteria—demand that it be applied with extreme care, nuance, and in conjunction with the full suite of historical-critical tools, including multiple attestation, dissimilarity, and contextual credibility. Its true value lies not as a definitive arbiter of fact, but as a diagnostic indicator. When a tradition appears to run "against the grain" of the author's demonstrable theological or apologetic interests, it raises the probability that the tradition is not a late invention of the church but has early and tenacious roots in the historical memory of the community.

This methodological caution reveals a more sophisticated application of the criterion. It is not merely a binary switch for labeling traditions as "historical" or "unhistorical." Instead, it can function as a powerful diagnostic tool for tracing the theological development of the early church. The way an embarrassing or difficult tradition is handled over time—how it is reported, explained, softened, or omitted across different sources—provides a unique window into the evolving Christological and ecclesiological concerns of the nascent Christian movement.

The baptism of Jesus by John serves as the paradigmatic case. The earliest Gospel, Mark, presents the event with a stark lack of explanation, suggesting it was a well-established part of the tradition that, at that stage, did not require justification. However, as the church's understanding of Jesus's person and status grew more sophisticated, the theological implications of this event—a sinless savior undergoing a baptism for the remission of sins—became more problematic. This is visible in the subsequent Gospels. Matthew confronts the problem directly by adding a dialogue where Jesus provides a theological rationale: "to fulfill all righteousness". Luke's Gospel strategically downplays the event, narrating it almost as an afterthought and separating it from the direct action of John the Baptist. Finally, the Gospel of John, with its high Christology, resolves the issue by omitting the baptism altogether, retaining only John's testimony to the descent of the Spirit. This clear trajectory—from stark report, to theological explanation, to narrative marginalization, to complete omission—acts as a "fingerprint" of a historical tradition that was initially accepted as fact but became progressively more awkward for a developing theology. In this way, the criterion does more than simply argue for the historicity of the baptism; it illuminates and maps the Christological journey of the early church as it grappled with the difficult data of its own history.

## Part II: The Historical Jesus in Non-Christian Texts

To construct a historical foundation for an inquiry into the life of Jesus, it is essential to move beyond the Christian scriptures and examine what contemporary or near-contemporary non-Christian sources have to say. While these sources are sparse—as would be expected for a non-elite figure from a remote province of the Roman Empire—they are invaluable for establishing an external, non-confessional baseline for Jesus's existence and the nature of the movement he founded. These Roman and Jewish accounts provide a crucial historical framework within which the Gospel narratives can be critically assessed.

### Section 2.1: Roman Corroboration and Context

Several Roman authors of the late first and early second centuries mention Jesus ("Christus") and his followers ("Christians"). These references are significant not only for their content but also for their often hostile tone, which makes it highly improbable that they were simply repeating Christian propaganda.

#### Cornelius Tacitus (c. 56-120 AD)

The most important non-Christian reference to Jesus comes from the Roman senator and historian Cornelius Tacitus, widely regarded as one of Rome's greatest historians. In his final work, the _Annals_ (written c. 116 AD), Tacitus recounts Emperor Nero's actions following the Great Fire of Rome in 64 AD. Seeking to deflect rumors that he himself was responsible, Nero scapegoated the city's Christians. In this context, Tacitus writes:

> "Consequently, to get rid of the report, Nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for their abominations, called Christians by the populace. Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus, and a most mischievous superstition, thus checked for the moment, again broke out not only in Judaea, the first source of the evil, but even in Rome..." (_Annals_ 15.44)

This brief passage is of immense historical value. With the dispassionate and disdainful tone of a Roman aristocrat, Tacitus corroborates several core facts that align with the Gospel accounts:

1. The founder of the movement was a historical person named "Christus".
    
2. He was executed by the Roman state ("suffered the extreme penalty").
    
3. The execution was carried out under the authority of Pontius Pilatus.
    
4. This event took place during the reign of Emperor Tiberius (14-37 AD).
    
5. The movement originated in the province of Judaea.
    
6. Despite the execution of its founder, the movement spread, reaching the city of Rome, where, by 64 AD, its followers constituted an "immense multitude" large enough to be used as a public scapegoat.
    

The scholarly consensus is that this passage is authentic and represents an independent source of information. Arguments from Jesus mythicists that the passage is a later Christian interpolation are overwhelmingly rejected by classical historians and biblical scholars. The highly negative language Tacitus uses—describing Christianity as a "mischievous superstition" and its adherents as "hated for their abominations"—makes it virtually certain that his information did not come from Christian sources and that the passage was not inserted by a Christian scribe. Tacitus provides a firm, non-Christian anchor for Jesus in a specific time and place.

#### Pliny the Younger (c. 61-113 AD)

Another crucial piece of evidence comes from Pliny the Younger, a Roman governor of Bithynia-Pontus (modern-day Turkey). Around 112 AD, Pliny wrote a letter to Emperor Trajan asking for guidance on how to conduct legal proceedings against those accused of being Christians. His letter offers a unique administrative snapshot of the early Christian community from an outsider's perspective.

Pliny details his interrogation methods, which involved giving the accused three chances to recant. If they persisted, they were executed for their "inflexible obstinacy". The litmus test was whether they were willing to worship the Roman gods and the emperor's image and, crucially, to "curse Christ," something Pliny was told "no true Christian can be compelled to do".

From his investigation, Pliny reports several key details about Christian practices:

1. They met regularly on a "fixed day" before dawn.
    
2. Their worship involved singing "a hymn to Christ, as to a god". This is a remarkable external confirmation of the early deification and worship of Jesus.
    
3. They bound themselves by a solemn oath (_sacramentum_) not to any wicked deeds, but to a high ethical code: to abstain from theft, fraud, adultery, and breaking their word.
    
4. The movement was widespread and socially diverse, attracting "many persons of every age, every rank, and also of both sexes" not only in cities but also in "villages and farms".
    

Pliny's letter confirms that by the early second century, Christianity was a distinct entity, its members were known for their exclusive worship of Christ as a divine figure, their strong moral code, and their willingness to face death rather than renounce their faith.

#### Gaius Suetonius Tranquillus (c. 69-122 AD)

The Roman historian Suetonius, in his work _The Lives of the Twelve Caesars_ (c. 121 AD), provides two brief but relevant passages. In the _Life of Nero_, he mentions that "Punishment was inflicted on the Christians, a class of men given to a new and mischievous superstition," corroborating Tacitus's account of the Neronian persecution.

The more debated reference appears in the _Life of Claudius_. Suetonius reports that Emperor Claudius (reigned 41-54 AD) "expelled the Jews from Rome, who had been continually raising disturbances at the goading of Chrestus" (_impulsore Chresto_). This has sparked considerable scholarly debate over whether "Chrestus" is a reference to Jesus Christ.

Arguments for the identification are compelling. "Chrestus" was a common variant spelling and pronunciation of "Christus" in the Roman world, and the Greek words for "good" (_chrestos_) and "anointed" (_christos_) were phonetically similar. The disturbances mentioned likely reflect the social turmoil within Roman synagogues as Christian missionaries began preaching that Jesus was the Messiah, a claim that would have been deeply divisive. It is also plausible that Suetonius, writing decades after the event, was confused and assumed the movement's founder was a contemporary agitator physically present in Rome.

Arguments against the identification note that "Chrestus" was a common name, especially for slaves, and that Suetonius uses the correct spelling "Christians" in his passage on Nero, suggesting he knew the difference. However, a significant majority of scholars conclude that this is likely a confused reference to Christ, whose followers' preaching was the source of the unrest that led to the expulsion of some Jews and Jewish Christians from Rome around 49 AD, an event also mentioned in the New Testament (Acts 18:2).

### Section 2.2: Jewish Accounts of Jesus and His Followers

References to Jesus in early Jewish literature are, unsurprisingly, rare and often hostile. Nevertheless, they provide important corroboration from the very cultural milieu from which Jesus emerged.

#### Flavius Josephus (c. 37-100 AD)

The writings of the first-century Jewish historian Flavius Josephus are of paramount importance. As a military commander in Galilee during the First Jewish-Roman War and later a historian under Flavian patronage, Josephus was uniquely positioned to have access to information about events in Judea during the first century. His magnum opus,

_Antiquities of the Jews_ (written c. 93-94 AD), contains two references to Jesus.

**The James Passage (_Antiquities_ 20.9.1):** The most historically secure and widely accepted reference is a brief, almost incidental mention of Jesus in the context of the unlawful execution of his brother, James, by the high priest Ananus in 62 AD. Josephus writes that Ananus "convened the judges of the Sanhedrin and brought before them a man named James, the brother of Jesus who was called the Christ, and certain others".

The authenticity of this passage is accepted by the overwhelming majority of scholars, including skeptical ones. Its value lies precisely in its casual and non-Christian tone. Josephus does not affirm that Jesus

_is_ the Christ, only that he was _called_ the Christ. The reference is secondary to the main story about James and Ananus. This incidental nature makes it highly unlikely to be a Christian interpolation. This passage independently confirms that Jesus was a historical figure, that he had a brother named James who was a prominent figure in his own right, and that Jesus was known by the messianic title "Christ" well before Josephus was writing.

**The _Testimonium Flavianum_ (_Antiquities_ 18.3.3):** The second, more extensive reference is one of the most debated passages in ancient literature. In the form it has come down to us in all Greek manuscripts, the passage reads as an overt Christian confession:

> "About this time there lived Jesus, a wise man, if indeed one ought to call him a man. For he was one who performed surprising deeds... He was the Christ. And when, upon the accusation of the principal men among us, Pilate had condemned him to a cross... He appeared to them spending a third day restored to life..."

Scholars have long recognized that a non-Christian Jew like Josephus would not have written these explicitly Christian phrases. This has led to three main scholarly positions regarding the passage's authenticity :

1. **Entirely Authentic:** This is a minority view held by very few scholars.
    
2. **Entirely a Forgery:** This is also a minority view, arguing that the entire paragraph was inserted by a later Christian scribe. This is considered unlikely because the passage is found in all extant manuscripts, and its removal would disrupt the narrative flow of the surrounding text.
    
3. **Authentic Core with Christian Interpolations:** This is the broad scholarly consensus. This view holds that Josephus wrote a more neutral or even negative account of Jesus, which was later embellished by Christian scribes who inserted the phrases of faith.
    

Support for the consensus view has been bolstered by the discovery of a 10th-century Arabic version of the _Testimonium_, preserved by the historian Agapius. This version is more restrained, stating, "He was perhaps the Messiah, concerning whom the prophets have reported wonders," and it lacks the explicit claim of the resurrection. Many scholars believe this Arabic text reflects a version of Josephus's original writing that is closer to the source and free from the most obvious Christian alterations.

Reconstructing the authentic core, scholars generally agree that Josephus likely wrote something to this effect: "About this time there lived Jesus, a wise man... For he was one who performed surprising deeds and was a teacher... He won over many Jews and many of the Greeks... And when, upon the accusation of the principal men among us, Pilate had condemned him to a cross, those who had first come to love him did not cease. And the tribe of the Christians, so called after him, has still to this day not disappeared." Even in this stripped-down form, Josephus corroborates that Jesus was a historical teacher known for remarkable deeds, who attracted a following of both Jews and Gentiles, and was crucified by Pontius Pilate at the instigation of Jewish leaders.

#### The Babylonian Talmud

Later Jewish rabbinic literature, compiled over several centuries after the time of Jesus, contains a few polemical and hostile references to a figure named "Yeshu." While these are of limited historical value for reconstructing Jesus's life due to their late date and antagonistic purpose, they do provide corroboration from a hostile perspective. The most relevant passage, found in the tractate

_Sanhedrin_ 43a, states:

> "On the eve of the Passover Yeshu was hanged. For forty days before the execution took place, a herald went forth and cried, 'He is going forth to be stoned because he has practiced sorcery and enticed Israel to apostasy...'"

Despite the historical inaccuracies (e.g., stoning versus crucifixion, the 40-day herald), this passage corroborates several key points from a hostile viewpoint: Jesus ("Yeshu") was a real person who was executed ("hanged" can be a synonym for crucifixion in Jewish texts) around the time of Passover, and he had a reputation for performing acts that his opponents labeled as sorcery.

### Section 2.3: Synthesizing the Extrabiblical Data

When the data from these disparate Roman and Jewish sources are consolidated, a remarkably consistent, albeit minimal, historical portrait of Jesus and the early Christian movement emerges. This portrait is constructed entirely from non-Christian, and often hostile, testimony.

|**Source (Author)**|**Work & Passage**|**Date of Writing (c.)**|**Key Information Corroborated**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Tacitus**|_Annals_ 15.44|116 AD|Founder named "Christus"; Executed by Pontius Pilate under Tiberius; Movement originated in Judea; Spread to Rome by 64 AD.|
|**Josephus**|_Antiquities_ 20.9.1|94 AD|Jesus was called "Christ"; Had a brother named James who was executed in 62 AD.|
|**Josephus**|_Antiquities_ 18.3.3 (Reconstructed Core)|94 AD|Jesus was a wise teacher; Performed surprising deeds; Won over many followers; Crucified by Pilate.|
|**Pliny the Younger**|_Letters_ 10.96|112 AD|Christians worshipped Christ "as to a god"; Bound by a high ethical code; Widespread and diverse following; Willing to be executed rather than curse Christ.|
|**Suetonius**|_Life of Claudius_ 25.4|121 AD|"Chrestus" (likely Christ) was the cause of disturbances among Jews in Rome, leading to their expulsion by Claudius (c. 49 AD).|
|**Talmud**|_Sanhedrin_ 43a|70-200 AD (Earliest traditions)|"Yeshu" (Jesus) was executed ("hanged") on the eve of Passover; Accused of sorcery and leading Israel astray.|

This synthesis of external evidence provides a firm "historical container" for the figure of Jesus. These sources independently establish his existence as a Jewish teacher named Jesus, who was called the Christ; his specific time and place (Judea, during the reign of Tiberius); his specific fate (execution by crucifixion under Pontius Pilate); and the surprising aftermath of his death (the continuation and rapid spread of his movement, whose followers worshipped him as divine and were willing to die for their belief).

A common skeptical objection arises from the relative paucity of such sources: if Jesus was such an influential figure, why was he not mentioned more widely by contemporary authors? This "argument from silence," however, misunderstands the nature of historical records in antiquity. As scholars like Bart Ehrman and Justin Meggitt have noted, the vast majority of the population in the Roman Empire, particularly the non-elite and the poor from provincial backwaters, left no trace in the historical or archaeological record. We possess no surviving contemporary eyewitness accounts even for far more prominent figures like Pontius Pilate himself. The historical record is remarkably silent on many individuals whose existence is not doubted; for example, the great Jewish sage Rabbi Hillel is not mentioned by Josephus, and the apostle Paul is not mentioned in any non-Christian source. In this context, the fact that a Galilean craftsman and itinerant preacher is mentioned at all by multiple independent Roman and Jewish historians is not just significant; it is historically remarkable. The silence of other authors is the expected historical norm, not evidence against his existence. The sources we do possess provide a robust external framework that aligns with the core biographical data of the Gospels and effectively refutes any claim that Jesus of Nazareth was a purely mythical figure.

## Part III: The Resurrection Data: Internal Evidence and Explanatory Power

Having established a firm historical container for Jesus of Nazareth through non-Christian sources, the analysis now turns to the internal evidence provided by the earliest Christian texts. These documents are not approached as inerrant scripture but as historical sources that can be subjected to the same critical methodologies outlined in Part I. The central question is what these early traditions reveal about the origins of the belief in Jesus's resurrection.

### Section 3.1: The Earliest Christian Proclamation

The single most important piece of evidence for the earliest Christian belief in the resurrection is not found in the Gospels but in an earlier letter written by the apostle Paul.

#### The 1 Corinthians 15 Creed

In his first letter to the church in Corinth, written around 55 AD, Paul addresses a dispute about the nature of resurrection. To ground his argument, he reminds the Corinthians of the foundational message he first delivered to them. In doing so, he quotes what is almost universally recognized by scholars as a very early, pre-Pauline creed or summary of the gospel message. Paul writes:

> "For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve. Then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have fallen asleep. Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles. Last of all, as to one untimely born, he appeared also to me." (1 Corinthians 15:3-8)

The historical significance of this passage cannot be overstated. Paul uses the technical rabbinic terms "received" (_parelabon_) and "delivered" (_paredoka_), which signify the formal and faithful transmission of an established, authoritative tradition, not his own personal formulation. Scholars have dated Paul's reception of this creed to his visit to Jerusalem to meet with Peter (Cephas) and James, an event he describes in his letter to the Galatians (Galatians 1:18-19). This visit took place only a few years after his own conversion, placing the origin of the creed itself to within a mere 3 to 8 years of the crucifixion (c. 33-38 AD).

The content of this ancient creed is striking. It establishes that from the very beginning, within the Jerusalem community of eyewitnesses, the core of the Christian proclamation consisted of four stylized facts: Jesus's death, his burial, his resurrection, and his subsequent appearances to specific individuals and groups. The list of witnesses is particularly notable, as it includes the key leaders of the Jerusalem church (Peter and James) as well as a large group ("more than five hundred brothers"), to whom Paul appeals as living corroborators.

The extreme antiquity of this creed is a fatal blow to any theory that posits the belief in Jesus's resurrection as a legend that developed gradually over decades of oral transmission. It demonstrates conclusively that the belief in a bodily resurrected Jesus who appeared to his followers was not a late, Hellenistic corruption of Jesus's original message. Instead, it was the central, foundational, and non-negotiable belief of the very first Aramaic-speaking Christians in Jerusalem, dating back to the generation of the eyewitnesses themselves.

### Section 3.2: The Resurrection Narratives and the Principle of Embarrassment

While the Gospels were written later than Paul's letters, they preserve traditions about the resurrection events. When analyzed through the lens of the criterion of embarrassment, several features of these narratives appear highly unlikely to have been invented.

#### The First Witnesses: Women at the Tomb

One of the most striking and consistent details across all four canonical Gospels is that the first people to discover the empty tomb, and the first to be commissioned as witnesses to the resurrection, were women—specifically Mary Magdalene and other female followers of Jesus. From a historical perspective, this is a deeply counter-intuitive and "embarrassing" detail.

To understand why, one must appreciate the social and legal status of women in first-century Judea. While the situation was complex and varied, the available evidence from sources like Josephus and later rabbinic texts (such as the Mishnah) indicates that the testimony of women was generally considered unreliable and was not admissible as valid evidence in a Jewish court of law. Josephus explicitly states that the law does not accept the testimony of women because of their "light-headedness and brazenness". While rabbinic law allowed for exceptions in certain specific circumstances where male witnesses were unavailable (for example, to establish a husband's death so a widow could remarry), the general rule was that the testimony of two qualified male witnesses was required for any serious matter.

In this cultural context, if one were inventing a story about the resurrection and wanted it to be persuasive, one would never choose women as the primary witnesses. To do so would be to build the entire evidential case for this extraordinary event on what the surrounding culture considered to be the weakest and least credible foundation imaginable. A fictional account designed for maximum impact would have featured high-status male disciples—Peter, John, or James—as the first to discover the empty tomb and receive the angelic message. The fact that all four Gospels insist on this counter-productive detail strongly suggests that the authors were not inventing a story but were reporting a historical tradition so firmly established that they felt constrained to include it, despite its apologetic awkwardness.

#### The Disciples' Doubt, Fear, and Confusion

The Gospel narratives do not portray the male disciples as paragons of faith who immediately grasped the reality of the resurrection. On the contrary, they are depicted as frightened, skeptical, and slow to believe. John's Gospel reports that on the evening of the resurrection, the disciples were hiding in a locked room "for fear of the Jewish leaders". When the women brought them the news of the empty tomb and the angelic message, Luke's Gospel states that "these words seemed to them an idle tale, and they did not believe them" (Luke 24:11).

Even when confronted with the risen Jesus himself, their immediate reaction is not faith but fear and disbelief. Luke reports that they were "startled and frightened, and thought they saw a spirit" (Luke 24:37). The story of Thomas, who famously declared he would not believe unless he could physically touch Jesus's wounds, is the culmination of this theme of doubt.

This portrayal is deeply embarrassing for the men who were to become the authoritative leaders and pillars of the church. A later hagiographical account would almost certainly have depicted them as bold, perceptive, and immediately receptive to the truth, thereby enhancing their status and credibility. The consistent inclusion of their cowardice, their dismissal of the women's testimony, and their persistent doubt runs directly against the grain of what one would expect from a laudatory invention. It strengthens the impression that the Gospel writers were recounting a historical memory of genuine human reactions—confusion, fear, and skepticism in the face of an unbelievable event—a memory that was too strong and too well-known to be sanitized for apologetic purposes.

### Section 3.3: The Transformation of the Apostles

Perhaps the most powerful circumstantial evidence for the resurrection is the radical and undeniable transformation of Jesus's followers in the weeks following his crucifixion. This was not merely a change in mood, but a complete reversal of character and conviction in the face of extreme personal risk.

#### The Phenomenon

The behavior of the disciples before and after the events of Easter weekend presents a stark contrast. In the hours following Jesus's arrest, they are defined by fear, failure, and despair. They all fled the Garden of Gethsemane to save themselves. Peter, their designated leader, publicly denied any association with Jesus three times. Their hopes were shattered, and their movement appeared to be over.

Yet, within a short period, these same men burst onto the public scene in Jerusalem, the very city where their leader had been executed, and began boldly proclaiming that God had raised Jesus from the dead. This motley crew of defeated and frightened fishermen and tax collectors was transformed into a band of courageous witnesses who could not be silenced by threats, imprisonment, or physical violence. The book of Acts records them being arrested, interrogated by the same religious authorities who had condemned Jesus, and beaten, only to rejoice that they were "counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the name" and continue preaching daily (Acts 5:40-42).

#### The High-Stakes Proclamation

This transformation is made all the more remarkable by the immense personal danger involved. As the user query rightly notes, the disciples were not merely risking public embarrassment; they were risking execution. The Roman state, as Pliny's letter confirms, considered adherence to the "name" of Christ a capital offense. The Jewish authorities viewed their message as blasphemous and seditious. Church tradition holds that at least ten of the original eleven remaining apostles, as well as the later apostle Paul, died as martyrs for their faith.

#### The Argument from Transformation

The argument from the disciples' transformation is not simply that people are willing to die for a belief. History is replete with examples of people dying for beliefs that were false. The crucial distinction here is that the apostles were in a unique position to know whether their claim was true or false. They were not dying for a theological principle they had received second-hand; they were dying for the empirical claim that they had personally and repeatedly seen, spoken with, touched, and eaten with Jesus of Nazareth

_after_ he had been publicly executed and buried.

It is psychologically implausible that this entire group of men would collectively decide to fabricate a lie and then proceed to suffer and die for it, one by one, over a period of decades, without a single one of them ever recanting. People do not willingly die for something they know to be a hoax. Their profound, collective, and sustained transformation from cowardice to courageous martyrdom demands a cause of sufficient magnitude to explain it. The only explanation the disciples themselves ever gave was that they had seen the risen Lord.

This transformation was not just behavioral but also profoundly conceptual. The disciples' post-resurrection proclamation was in many ways cognitively dissonant with their own inherited Jewish worldview, making its spontaneous invention highly improbable. First-century Jewish belief about resurrection was almost exclusively focused on a general, corporate resurrection of all the righteous at the end of time; the idea of a single individual being resurrected in the middle of history was conceptually alien.

Furthermore, the Jewish expectation of the Messiah was that of a triumphant, Davidic king who would defeat Israel's pagan enemies and restore the kingdom. It was certainly not of a failed claimant who would be shamefully executed by those same enemies. Crucifixion, in particular, was seen as a sign of being under God's curse, according to Deuteronomy 21:23 ("Cursed is everyone who is hanged on a tree"), a passage Paul himself quotes in Galatians 3:13. Therefore, for the disciples to suddenly begin proclaiming a

_crucified_ Messiah who had been _resurrected_ ahead of the general resurrection was to create a belief system that radically contradicted their deepest political and theological expectations. The message was, as Paul later put it, "a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles" (1 Corinthians 1:23). This raises a critical question: what could possibly motivate them to invent and die for a belief that was so scandalous and counter-intuitive? A simple grief-induced hallucination or a cynical desire to keep their movement alive seems psychologically and theologically insufficient to explain the

_creation_ of this specific, world-altering belief. The event they claimed to have witnessed—the bodily resurrection of their cursed and crucified leader—is the cause they gave, a cause proportionate to the radical conceptual and behavioral revolution they underwent.

## Part IV: Evaluating Alternative Explanations

A comprehensive historical inquiry requires not only an examination of the evidence for a particular claim but also a critical assessment of alternative hypotheses. In the case of the resurrection, several naturalistic explanations have been proposed over the centuries to account for the data without recourse to a supernatural event. These theories must be evaluated based on their explanatory scope (the range of facts they can account for) and their explanatory power (how well they account for those facts).

### Section 4.1: An Assessment of Naturalistic Hypotheses

The primary historical data that any successful theory must explain include: the death of Jesus by crucifixion; the discovery of his empty tomb; the post-mortem appearances to various individuals and groups; and the radical transformation of the disciples into bold proclaimers of the resurrection.

#### The Swoon Theory

This theory posits that Jesus did not actually die on the cross but was merely unconscious or in a coma. He was mistaken for dead, and the cool, damp air of the tomb revived him. He then emerged from the tomb and presented himself to his disciples, who mistook his resuscitation for a resurrection.

This hypothesis, popular among some 18th and 19th-century rationalists, is now almost universally rejected by modern scholars, including critical and skeptical historians. The German critic David Strauss is often credited with delivering its "death-blow" in the 19th century. The objections are formidable. First, the medical evidence makes survival of a Roman crucifixion highly improbable. Victims of scourging and crucifixion died from a combination of traumatic shock, blood loss, and eventual asphyxiation. The Gospel of John also reports that a Roman soldier pierced Jesus's side with a spear to ensure his death, an act that would have been fatal.

Second, and more importantly, the theory fails on psychological grounds. Had Jesus managed to survive, he would have emerged from the tomb not as a glorious, triumphant conqueror of death, but as a severely wounded, bleeding, and traumatized man in desperate need of medical attention. Such a sight would have elicited pity and concern from his disciples, not worship. It could not possibly have been the catalyst for their transformation from despair to joy, nor could it have formed the basis for their proclamation of a glorious resurrection and the beginning of a world-changing religious movement.

#### The Stolen/Moved Body Theory

This theory suggests that the disciples, or other interested parties (like Joseph of Arimathea), stole or moved Jesus's body from the tomb and then either fabricated the story of the resurrection or were themselves misled. This is one of the oldest counter-explanations, as it is mentioned in the Gospel of Matthew as the story the Jewish authorities paid the tomb guards to spread (Matthew 28:11-15).

While this theory can account for the empty tomb, it fails to explain the other key data points. Most critically, it cannot account for the sincere transformation of the disciples and their willingness to suffer and die for their proclamation. As argued previously, while people will die for what they believe to be true, it is psychologically untenable that the entire group of apostles would endure persecution and martyrdom for a message they knew to be a deliberate fraud.

Furthermore, this theory offers no explanation for the post-mortem appearances, especially to those who were not part of the inner circle or were initially hostile to the movement, such as James, the brother of Jesus, and Paul (formerly Saul of Tarsus). Why would these former skeptics convert and become leaders in a movement based on a stolen body? The theory requires a separate, ad-hoc explanation for each of these conversions and appearances, weakening its overall explanatory power.

#### The Subjective Vision / Hallucination Theory

This is the most common and scientifically sophisticated naturalistic explanation advanced by modern critics. This theory posits that the disciples were not lying; they genuinely believed they saw the risen Jesus. However, these experiences were not objective encounters with a physically resurrected person but were subjective, mind-generated phenomena such as grief-induced hallucinations or visions.

While this theory has the advantage of accounting for the disciples' sincerity, it faces a number of severe historical and psychological challenges :

1. **The Problem of Group Hallucinations:** The New Testament reports appearances not only to individuals (Peter, Mary Magdalene, Paul) but also to groups of various sizes (the Twelve, the 500 brothers). However, clinical psychology understands hallucinations to be private, individual events stemming from a person's own mind. The notion that multiple people, let alone 500, could have the same hallucination at the same time is without parallel and is considered by most psychologists to be impossible.
    
2. **The Variety of Appearances:** The appearances are reported to have occurred over a period of 40 days, in a wide variety of locations (a garden, a locked room, a road, a mountainside, by a lake), and to people in very different states of mind (grieving, fearful, skeptical, hostile). This diversity of circumstance does not fit the typical profile of hallucinations, which are often tied to specific locations or emotional states.
    
3. **The Lack of Psychological Preconditions:** Hallucinations are most often triggered by a state of intense expectation, desire, or emotional excitement. The disciples, however, were in a state of despair, fear, and shattered hopes following the humiliating execution of their leader. Their psychological state was antithetical to the one required to produce wish-fulfillment hallucinations.
    
4. **The Conversion of Skeptics:** The theory struggles to explain the appearances to skeptics and enemies of the movement, such as Paul and James. These individuals had no prior belief in Jesus's resurrection and no desire to see him alive; in Paul's case, he was actively persecuting the church. A grief-based hallucination model cannot account for these transformative experiences.
    
5. **The Empty Tomb:** This remains the theory's most significant weakness. A hallucination is a purely mental event; it cannot account for a missing physical body. If the disciples were merely hallucinating, the authorities could have immediately and decisively crushed the nascent Christian movement by going to the tomb and producing the corpse of Jesus. Proponents of the hallucination theory must therefore combine it with a separate, independent theory (such as the stolen body theory) to account for all the facts. This makes the explanation less simple and more ad-hoc.
    

### Section 4.2: A Comparative Analysis of Explanatory Scope

When evaluating competing historical hypotheses, historians look for the explanation that best accounts for the established data in the most comprehensive and coherent manner. This involves assessing criteria such as explanatory scope (how many of the facts does it explain?) and explanatory power (how well and how simply does it explain them?).

The naturalistic theories, while plausible in explaining isolated pieces of the data, struggle to provide a single, unified explanation for the entire constellation of facts. The swoon theory fails to account for the nature of the resurrection appearances and the disciples' worship. The stolen body theory fails to account for the disciples' sincerity and the conversion of skeptics. The hallucination theory, the strongest of the alternatives, fails to account for the empty tomb and the group appearances. To make these theories work, they must be combined, creating a complex and often convoluted series of events (e.g., "The disciples stole the body

_and_ then had mass hallucinations that they sincerely believed, which also happened to convert their enemies").

The resurrection hypothesis, by contrast—the claim that God raised Jesus from the dead—is the explanation that the disciples themselves gave. From a purely historical standpoint, if one grants the possibility of the event, it possesses superior explanatory scope and power. It accounts for all the primary data with a single cause:

- **The Empty Tomb:** Jesus was raised, so the tomb was empty.
    
- **The Appearances:** Jesus was raised, so he appeared to his followers.
    
- **The Disciples' Transformation:** They saw the risen Lord, which transformed them from cowards into courageous martyrs.
    

This is not to say that historical methodology can _prove_ a supernatural event. The historian, working within the confines of naturalistic cause and effect, can only go so far. However, a rigorous historical analysis can demonstrate that the belief in Jesus's resurrection is not based on a late-developing legend but is rooted in specific claims made by named individuals in the immediate aftermath of Jesus's death. It can further show that the alternative naturalistic explanations proposed to account for these claims face significant historical, logical, and psychological difficulties.

## Conclusion

This inquiry into the death and resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth has navigated the complex terrain of historical-critical methodology, extrabiblical testimony, and the internal evidence of the earliest Christian sources. The analysis yields a series of convergent conclusions that provide a robust framework for understanding the historical origins of Christianity.

First, the application of historical-critical tools, particularly the criterion of embarrassment, reveals that the Gospel narratives contain elements that are unlikely to be later inventions. Details such as the baptism of Jesus by John, the consistent failures of the disciples, the naming of women as the first witnesses to the resurrection, and the disciples' initial doubt and fear are all counter-productive from an apologetic standpoint. Their inclusion suggests that the Gospel writers were constrained by historical traditions that were too early and too well-established to be ignored or sanitized. These "embarrassing" facts lend a strong sense of verisimilitude to the core narrative.

Second, an examination of non-Christian sources from the first and second centuries establishes a firm historical foundation for the central figure and events of the Christian faith. The combined testimony of Tacitus, Josephus, Pliny the Younger, Suetonius, and even the hostile traditions in the Talmud, confirms that a Jewish teacher named Jesus, called the Christ, lived in Judea, gathered followers, and was crucified under Pontius Pilate during the reign of Tiberius. These external sources also corroborate the remarkable aftermath: the rapid growth of a movement whose followers worshipped Jesus as a god and were willing to face execution rather than renounce him. This "historical container" refutes any notion of Jesus as a purely mythical figure and aligns with the basic biographical data of the New Testament.

Third, the earliest Christian proclamation, preserved in the pre-Pauline creed of 1 Corinthians 15, demonstrates that the belief in Jesus's death, burial, resurrection, and post-mortem appearances was not a late theological development. It was the foundational, non-negotiable core of the Christian message within the Jerusalem community, dating to within a few years of the crucifixion itself and rooted in the testimony of the original eyewitnesses.

Finally, when the primary historical data—the empty tomb, the appearances, and the radical transformation of the disciples—are considered together, the challenge for any historical explanation is to account for this entire constellation of facts in a coherent and non-contradictory manner. While various naturalistic hypotheses have been proposed, each struggles to explain the full range of the evidence. The swoon theory is medically and psychologically implausible. The stolen body theory fails to account for the disciples' sincere martyrdom. The hallucination theory, while the most sophisticated alternative, cannot explain the empty tomb, the group appearances, or the conversion of skeptics.

The historian, as a historian, cannot prove a miracle. The scientific naturalist will, by definition, rule out a supernatural explanation _a priori_. However, a historical-critical analysis can demonstrate that the disciples' belief in the resurrection was not the product of a slowly evolving legend or a simple misunderstanding. It was a revolutionary conviction, born from a series of events in the days and weeks immediately following Jesus's death, that transformed their lives and worldview. The historical evidence indicates that alternative naturalistic explanations, while attempting to account for these events, face significant and, in some cases, insurmountable challenges. The ultimate question left by the historical inquiry is what cause is sufficient to explain the totality of the evidence. The disciples provided their own unambiguous answer, an answer that gave birth to a movement that would reshape the course of human history: Jesus of Nazareth had been raised from the dead.
