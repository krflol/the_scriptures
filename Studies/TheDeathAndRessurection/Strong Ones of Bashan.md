# Encircled by Power: A Historical, Literary, and Theological Analysis of the "Strong Ones of Bashan" in Psalm 22

The phrase "Strong ones of Bashan have encircled Me," found in the twelfth verse of Psalm 22, stands as one of the most evocative and potent images of oppression in the Hebrew Bible. It is a cry of anguish that resonates with a power drawn from a deep well of geographical reality, historical memory, literary artistry, and profound theological reflection. While on the surface a simple lament of being surrounded by enemies, a deeper analysis reveals a multi-layered metaphor that encapsulates themes of overwhelming power, moral corruption, and spiritual warfare. This report will provide an exhaustive exegesis of this single verse and its surrounding context, demonstrating how its meaning is constructed and amplified through its various interpretive lenses.

Traditionally ascribed to King David, Psalm 22 is a pivotal text in the Psalter, a profound lament that has become a cornerstone for both Jewish and Christian understanding of suffering, abandonment, and ultimate deliverance. Its journey from the depths of despair to a crescendo of universal praise has provided a framework for faith in the face of overwhelming adversity for millennia. To fully comprehend the weight of the "strong ones of Bashan," this report will systematically unpack the query by first exploring the tangible world of Bashan—its geography, history, and formidable reputation. It will then deconstruct the metaphor of the "bulls of Bashan" to reveal its layers of meaning. Following this, the analysis will turn to the literary context of Psalm 22, where this phrase is embedded. Finally, the report will examine the rich and divergent interpretations of the psalm within Jewish and Christian traditions, revealing how the identity of both the sufferer and the "strong ones" shifts depending on the interpretive prism.

## The World of Bashan: A Land of Giants, Pastures, and Power

The metaphorical power of the "strong ones of Bashan" is not arbitrary; it is built upon the literal foundation of the region's formidable and widely known reputation. To understand the symbol, one must first understand the place. Bashan was a land that evoked images of immense strength, primordial conflict, and unparalleled abundance, making it the perfect geographical touchstone for an enemy that seemed insurmountable.

### Locating Bashan: The Geographical and Agricultural Landscape

Ancient Bashan was a well-defined and strategically important region located to the east of the Jordan River and the Sea of Galilee. Its territory extended from the land of Gilead in the south to the slopes of Mount Hermon in the north, a geographical area that corresponds significantly with the modern-day Golan Heights and parts of southern Syria.

The region's fame was rooted in its extraordinary fertility. Composed of a basaltic plateau with rich volcanic soil and benefiting from ample rainfall, Bashan was a proverbial land of plenty. This natural endowment made it one of the ancient Near East's most productive agricultural zones, renowned for its lush pastures ideal for raising livestock and its capacity to produce vast quantities of grain. In the Old Testament, it was famous for its high-quality cattle, sheep, and goats, with Deuteronomy 32:14 praising the "fat of lambs and rams of the breed of Bashan". This reputation for agricultural wealth was so enduring that by the New Testament era, the region was recognized as one of the great granaries of the Roman Empire.

Beyond its pastures, Bashan was also known for its dense forests of majestic oak trees. In the prophetic literature, the "oaks of Bashan" are frequently mentioned in parallel with the famed cedars of Lebanon, serving as a powerful symbol of earthly strength, pride, and loftiness. The quality and size of this timber were such that the prophet Ezekiel notes that the mighty commercial empire of Tyre used the oaks of Bashan to fashion the oars for its formidable fleet of ships (Ezekiel 27:6).

### A History of Conquest: From King Og and the Rephaim to Roman Rule

Bashan's history is as formidable as its landscape. The region first enters the biblical narrative as the kingdom of Og, an Amorite king who is described as one of the last of the Rephaim—a race of giants. The account in Deuteronomy and Numbers portrays Og as a terrifying adversary ruling over a kingdom of sixty fortified cities, including Ashtaroth and Edrei, with high walls and bronze-gated defenses. The Israelite victory over Og and his giant armies became a foundational story in the national consciousness, a testament to God's power to deliver His people from seemingly insurmountable foes. This event was recalled repeatedly throughout Israel's history as a prime example of divine deliverance.

Following the conquest, the territory was allotted to the half-tribe of Manasseh. Its strategic and economic importance ensured it remained a significant, if often contested, part of the Israelite domain. During the united monarchy, it was one of King Solomon's twelve commissariat districts, responsible for provisioning the royal household for one month of the year. However, its location on the frontier made it vulnerable. In the reign of Jehu, it was conquered by the Aramean king Hazael of Damascus, only to be recaptured by King Jehoash of Israel a generation later.

The region's history continued to be one of changing imperial control. It was eventually overrun by the Assyrians under Tiglath-Pileser III. In subsequent centuries, it fell under Persian, and then Hellenistic rule. During the Hasmonean period, it was briefly controlled by Alexander Jannaeus of Judaea before the arrival of the Romans. Under Roman administration, it was granted to client kings like Herod the Great and his son Philip. Eventually, it was incorporated into the Roman province of Arabia, with the city of Bostra (the biblical Bozrah) serving as its capital. This long and storied history of powerful rulers, giant enemies, and imperial conquests solidified Bashan's identity as a land of might and conflict.

### The Reputation of Bashan: Formidable Livestock and Mythic Undertones

The most direct source for the psalm's metaphor comes from Bashan's famous livestock. The rich pastures of the region produced a breed of cattle renowned throughout the ancient world for its remarkable size, strength, and ferocity. These were not merely docile farm animals. Commentators and natural historians note that the wild bulls of the region were particularly aggressive, known to exhibit the very behavior described in the psalm: gathering in a circle to surround a novel or threatening object before charging with their horns. This real-world behavior provides the direct and terrifying visual that the psalmist leverages to describe his feeling of being cornered by his enemies.

However, the dread associated with Bashan extends beyond the physical into the metaphysical. The choice of Bashan invokes a deeper, more ancient terror. The region's primordial association is with King Og and the Rephaim. While "Rephaim" denotes a race of giants in the context of Og, the term carries other, more ominous meanings elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible and in cognate Semitic languages. In texts from the ancient city of Ugarit and in Phoenician inscriptions, the cognate term

_rp'um_ refers to a special class of the dead, sometimes a cult of deified or heroic ancestral kings who inhabited the underworld. This suggests that, in the Israelite imagination, Bashan was not just the land of giants, but "the land of the shades".

This association with the underworld is further reinforced by a key geographical feature within Bashan's broader territory. At the foot of Mount Hermon, in the city of Caesarea Philippi, was a grotto dedicated to the Greek god Pan, a site that was famously known in the ancient world as the "Gates of Hell". This location was seen as a literal gateway to the netherworld. Therefore, the psalmist's reference to Bashan carries a potential escalation of threat. The enemies are not merely like strong animals from a powerful region; they are like forces emerging from a land associated with primordial giants, the spirits of the dead, and a gateway to the underworld itself. The conflict is thus elevated from a personal struggle against human adversaries to a cosmic battle against forces that are ancient, demonic, and aligned with death.

## Deconstructing the Metaphor: The "Strong Bulls of Bashan"

The phrase "strong bulls of Bashan" is a masterfully constructed metaphor that operates on three distinct but simultaneous levels of meaning. It describes enemies who are not only physically overwhelming but also morally corrupt and theologically hostile. Each layer adds to the sense of totalizing oppression felt by the psalmist.

### The Literal Image: Fierce Cattle as a Symbol of Unbridled Strength

The primary and most immediate meaning of the metaphor is one of overwhelming physical power and brute, violent aggression. The psalmist paints a visceral picture of being encircled and cornered by a herd of angry, powerful animals, poised to gore and trample their victim to death. This imagery conveys a profound sense of being trapped in an unwinnable and terrifying situation, facing forces that are "fierce, savage, and violent". It is a metaphor for raw, untamable power that threatens to crush the lone and vulnerable speaker. The strength is not just impressive; it is menacing and life-threatening.

### The Symbolic Meaning: Arrogance, Oppression, and Pampered Pride

The metaphor quickly expands from physical strength to encompass social and moral corruption. The Septuagint and Vulgate translations render the phrase as "fat bulls," an interpretation supported by the context of Bashan's lush pastures. This fatness symbolizes more than just size; it represents the "wantonness and insolence of pampered pride". The enemies are not just strong; they are bloated with their own power and privilege.

This interpretation is strongly supported by the use of similar imagery elsewhere in the prophetic literature. The prophet Amos, in a scathing indictment of the elite in the northern kingdom's capital, declares: "Hear this word, you cows of Bashan, who are on the mountain of Samaria, who oppress the poor, who crush the needy" (Amos 4:1). Here, the "cows of Bashan" are the wealthy, indulgent, and powerful women of the ruling class, whose luxury is built upon the exploitation of the vulnerable.

By invoking the "bulls of Bashan," the psalmist taps into this same prophetic critique. The enemies are thus characterized as being not only physically mighty but also arrogant, abusive, and morally bankrupt, corrupted by the very wealth and power that makes them strong. They are the oppressors who have grown fat on injustice.

### The Shadow of Idolatry: Bull Imagery and the Worship of Baal

The deepest and most troubling layer of the metaphor is theological. Throughout the ancient Near East, and particularly among Israel's Canaanite neighbors, the bull was a primary symbol of divinity, representing strength, virility, and storm-like power. It was most famously associated with the god Baal, the chief rival to Yahweh in the religious landscape of ancient Israel.

This association charges the metaphor with the weight of Israel's own history of apostasy. The most infamous instance is the worship of the Golden Calf at the foot of Mount Sinai, a moment of profound rebellion against God just after the covenant was established. Later, after the kingdom divided, King Jeroboam I of the northern kingdom of Israel set up two golden calves in Dan and Bethel as alternative objects of worship to prevent his people from traveling to the Temple in Jerusalem. This act of political expediency became the "sin of Jeroboam," a foundational act of idolatry that the biblical historians cite as a primary reason for the northern kingdom's eventual destruction and exile.

Viewed through this lens, the "strong bulls of Bashan" represent far more than human enemies. They symbolize the very forces of idolatry, paganism, and rebellion arrayed against the faithful servant of God. The psalmist feels encircled not just by powerful men, but by the spiritual and demonic powers that animate them—the same forces that have tempted Israel away from its God throughout its history. The struggle is thus cast as a holy war, a conflict between the lone righteous one and the massed forces of theological rebellion.

## The Voice of the Sufferer: The Literary Context of Psalm 22

The meaning of the phrase "strong bulls of Bashan" is profoundly amplified by its placement within the literary and emotional landscape of Psalm 22. The verse does not exist in a vacuum; it is a key moment in a larger poetic drama of suffering and redemption, situated amidst a bestiary of other terrifying foes and in stark contrast to the psalmist's own self-perception of utter degradation.

### From Lament to Praise: The Dramatic Structure and Thematic Arc of the Psalm

Psalm 22 is a quintessential example of an individual lament, a poetic form common in the Psalter where a speaker cries out to God from a state of deep distress. What makes Psalm 22 so remarkable is its dramatic structural shift. The psalm is broadly divided into two major sections. The first part, verses 1-21, is a raw and desperate lament, beginning with the iconic cry of abandonment, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?". The second part, verses 22-31, marks a stunning reversal, shifting to a confident hymn of thanksgiving and a call for universal praise that extends to all nations and future generations.

The "bulls of Bashan" appear in verse 12, at the very height of the psalmist's description of his peril. This placement is crucial. The psalmist has already pleaded with God not to be far away because "trouble is near and there is no one to help" (v. 11). The appearance of the bulls is the immediate confirmation of this terror. They are the embodiment of the "trouble" that is not just near, but has now completely encircled him. Their presence marks the nadir of the psalmist's physical predicament, making the subsequent turn to hope and the ultimate declaration of deliverance ("You have answered me," v. 21) all the more powerful and miraculous.

### The Depths of Humiliation: An Analysis of the Speaker's Suffering ("I am a worm")

The overwhelming power of the "bulls" is made even more stark by the psalmist's description of his own condition. In verse 6, long before the bulls appear, the speaker declares, "But I am a worm, and no man, scorned by mankind and despised by the people". This statement establishes the extreme power differential at the heart of the conflict. It is not a battle of equals, but the persecution of the utterly debased and dehumanized by the overwhelmingly powerful.

A deeper linguistic analysis of this verse, particularly within Christian theological interpretation, reveals a layer of meaning that becomes a key to the entire psalm's transformative power. The Hebrew word used for "worm" here is not the common word `rimmah`, which often refers to a maggot or a symbol of decay. The word is `tola'at` (or `tola`), which refers specifically to the _coccus ilicis_, a small insect known as the "crimson worm" or "scarlet worm". This particular creature was highly significant in ancient Israel, as it was the source of a valuable and permanent scarlet dye. This crimson dye, called

`tola'at shani`, was used in some of the most sacred contexts, including the dyeing of the curtains for the Tabernacle and the vestments of the High Priest.

The life cycle of the female `tola'at` worm provides a stunning natural allegory. When ready to lay her eggs, she climbs a tree or wooden post, attaching herself to it so firmly that she can never leave. She lays her eggs beneath her, forming a protective shell with her own body. The larvae hatch and feed on the living body of their mother for sustenance. Upon her death, the mother worm releases a crimson fluid that permanently stains the wood and her own offspring. After three days, her dead body loses its crimson color and turns into a white, waxy substance that flakes off and falls to the ground like snow.

This life cycle, when viewed as a `remez` (a Hebrew term for a deep hint or allegorical meaning), becomes a profound picture of sacrificial, redemptive suffering. The imagery of a creature willingly giving its life on a piece of wood, its body being consumed to give life to others, and its death leaving a permanent crimson stain, is seen as a foreshadowing of Christ's crucifixion. In this reading, the statement "I am a worm" is not just a cry of degradation. It is the hidden engine of the psalm's transformation. It introduces the concept that the suffering being endured is not meaningless but is purposeful and sacrificial. It is precisely at this moment of identifying with the ultimate, life-giving sacrifice that the possibility for glorious deliverance is born, providing the theological impetus for the psalm's dramatic shift from lament to praise.

### A Bestiary of Foes: Situating the "Bulls" Among the Lions and Dogs

The "bulls of Bashan" do not appear as an isolated threat. They are part of a terrifying menagerie of animal metaphors that the psalmist uses to describe the multifaceted nature of his enemies. Immediately after the bulls encircle him, the psalmist adds, "They open their mouths against me like a ravening and a roaring lion" (v. 13). Later, in verse 16, he cries, "For dogs have surrounded me; a company of evildoers has encircled me.".

This progression of imagery intensifies the feeling of being hunted, cornered, and torn apart by savage, inhuman forces. Each animal contributes a specific dimension to the horror. The bulls represent the heavy, powerful, trampling force that surrounds and crushes. The lion represents the tearing, devouring predator, eager to rend its prey. The dogs represent a scavenging, defiling pack, surrounding the victim with contempt and malice. Together, they create a comprehensive picture of an assault from all sides by forces that are powerful, predatory, and profane.

## Prisms of Interpretation: Psalm 22 in Faith Traditions

The profound depth and raw emotion of Psalm 22 have made it a foundational text for both Judaism and Christianity. However, the two traditions have historically read the psalm through different interpretive lenses, leading to different identifications of the suffering speaker and his powerful adversaries, the "bulls of Bashan."

### The Voice of Israel: The Psalm as a Royal Lament and National Allegory (Jewish Interpretation)

In traditional Jewish exegesis, Psalm 22 is primarily understood as a personal lament or a national allegory grounded in the historical experience of the Jewish people. One common interpretation identifies the speaker with the psalm's traditional author, King David. In this view, the psalm recounts a specific period of intense suffering in David's life, such as his persecution by King Saul or his flight during the rebellion of his son Absalom. The "bulls of Bashan" would then represent David's powerful political and military enemies—the court of Saul, the Philistines, or the treacherous members of his own kingdom.

A broader interpretation sees the speaker not as an individual, but as a personification of the entire nation of Israel. The psalmist's cry of abandonment and suffering reflects the collective agony of the Jewish people during periods of exile and persecution. The "strong bulls of Bashan" thus become a metaphor for the mighty, oppressive empires that surrounded and threatened Israel throughout its history, such as the Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, or Romans. The psalm becomes a prayer for national deliverance, expressing the hope that God will rescue His people from their powerful tormentors as He did in the past.

### The Cry of Esther: Rabbinic Interpretations and the Purim Narrative

A particularly rich and specific Jewish interpretation, found in rabbinic literature, connects Psalm 22 directly to the figure of Queen Esther and the events commemorated in the festival of Purim. According to the Talmud and Midrash, Esther recited this very psalm as she bravely prepared to approach her husband, King Ahasuerus, unbidden—an act punishable by death—to plead for the salvation of her people from Haman's genocidal decree.

The tradition teaches that as Esther walked through the palace halls, she passed the court's idols, and in that moment, she felt the Divine Presence withdraw from her, prompting her to cry out the psalm's opening line, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?". In this powerful narrative context, the "bulls of Bashan" and the other ravenous beasts represent the hostile and menacing forces of the Persian court, the scheming vizier Haman, and the existential threat of annihilation that loomed over the Jewish people. The psalm is thus transformed into the liturgical and emotional heart of the Purim story, a prayer that moves from the brink of destruction to a miraculous deliverance, celebrated by the entire community.

### The Passion Prophecy: The Christian Messianic Reading of the Psalm

From the earliest days of the church, the dominant Christian interpretation has been to read Psalm 22 as a direct and remarkably detailed prophecy of the suffering, crucifixion, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. This reading is anchored in the Gospels themselves, most notably by the fact that Jesus quotes the opening verse of the psalm from the cross: "

_Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?_" ("My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"). In the rabbinic practice of the time, quoting the first line of a text was a common way to invoke the entire work, suggesting that Jesus was identifying his entire passion experience with the journey of suffering and vindication described in Psalm 22.

In this Christological reading, the "strong bulls of Bashan" are identified with the coalition of powerful human and spiritual forces that conspired to bring about Jesus's death. They represent the chief priests, scribes, and elders of the Sanhedrin who condemned him; the mocking crowds who called for his crucifixion; the powerful Roman soldiers who carried out the execution; and, on a deeper level, the demonic powers of sin and death that were arrayed against God's redemptive plan. Every element of the psalmist's suffering finds a direct parallel in the passion narratives, solidifying the psalm's status as "the fifth passion narrative" in the Christian tradition.

The density of these parallels is striking and forms the basis for the Christian messianic interpretation.

|Psalm 22 Verse/Description|Gospel Parallel (Event & Scripture Reference)|
|---|---|
|v. 1: "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"|Jesus's cry from the cross (Matthew 27:46; Mark 15:34)|
|vv. 7-8: "All who see me mock me... 'He trusts in the LORD...'"|The crowds and leaders mock Jesus on the cross using similar language (Matthew 27:39-43; Luke 23:35)|
|v. 12: "Many bulls surround me; strong bulls of Bashan..."|The hostile forces (leaders, soldiers, crowd) encircling the cross (Matthew 27; Mark 15; Luke 23; John 19)|
|v. 14: "I am poured out like water, all my bones are out of joint"|Description of physical agony and exhaustion consistent with crucifixion|
|v. 15: "My tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth"|Jesus says, "I am thirsty" (John 19:28)|
|v. 16: "They have pierced my hands and my feet" (LXX/Christian reading)|The nailing of Jesus to the cross (John 20:25-27; Luke 24:39-40)|
|v. 17: "I can count all my bones"|The exposure and emaciation of the body on the cross|
|v. 18: "They divide my garments... they cast lots for my clothing"|Roman soldiers divide Jesus's clothes and cast lots for his tunic (Matthew 27:35; John 19:23-24)|
|v. 22: "I will declare your name to my brothers"|Jesus tells Mary Magdalene to go to his "brothers" after the resurrection (John 20:17; cf. Hebrews 2:12)|

These divergent readings are not necessarily mutually exclusive. From a Christian theological perspective, the relationship between the Jewish and Christian interpretations can be understood through the hermeneutical lens of typology. This approach sees historical persons, events, or institutions in the Old Testament as divinely ordained prefigurements, or "types," that point toward a future, ultimate fulfillment, or "antitype," in Christ and the New Covenant.

In this framework, the historical suffering of David, the national agony of Israel, or the personal crisis of Esther are all real and valid contexts for the psalm. However, they are also seen as foreshadowing the ultimate suffering and vindication of the Messiah. The New Testament writers did not view the psalm as being _only_ about Jesus, but rather as a prayer of David that finds its fullest, deepest, and most complete meaning in the passion of Christ. This typological approach allows the Christian interpretation to honor the psalm's original historical context while simultaneously elevating it to a new, Christological level, explaining how the early church could so readily and comprehensively apply this ancient prayer to the defining event of its faith.

## Conclusion: A Synthesis of Meaning

The journey to understand the phrase "Strong ones of Bashan have encircled Me" begins on the fertile, basaltic plains east of the Jordan and ends at the foot of a cross in Jerusalem, passing through the courts of kings and the depths of national despair along the way. The analysis reveals that this is far more than a simple statement of distress; it is a dense, multi-layered declaration whose power is meticulously constructed from geography, history, and theology.

The raw, physical power of the geographical Bashan—a land of giant foes, mighty oaks, and fierce cattle—provides the literal and unforgettable foundation for the metaphorical "bulls." This metaphor is then given profound social and moral depth, evoking not just strength but the arrogant, oppressive pride of the corrupt elite. This image, in turn, is charged with theological weight, symbolizing the idolatrous forces of paganism arrayed against the faithful servant of God.

This potent metaphor is placed with literary precision at the climax of the suffering described in Psalm 22, a psalm that journeys from the ultimate degradation of being a "worm" to the ultimate vindication of leading a global chorus of praise. Finally, this entire literary and metaphorical structure is refracted through the prisms of faith. In the Jewish tradition, the sufferer's cry gives voice to a persecuted king, a desperate queen, and an exiled nation, all awaiting God's deliverance. In the Christian tradition, that same cry becomes the voice of the suffering Messiah, whose personal agony fulfills the ancient pattern and brings about a universal redemption.

The enduring power of this ancient phrase lies in its remarkable capacity to articulate the universal human experience of being overwhelmed by hostile forces—be they political, social, or spiritual. At the same time, it points toward a hope for deliverance that is not abstract, but is rooted in the specific, powerful, and redemptive historical narratives of two of the world's major faiths.
