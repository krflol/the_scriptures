### The Second Fourteen Generations: The Davidic Monarchy (vv. 6b-11)

This section traces the royal line from its glorious height under Solomon through its long, tragic decline to its apparent end in the Babylonian Exile.

- **Grace in the Royal Line: Bathsheba (v. 6b):** The fourth woman is introduced in the most scandalous context of all. Matthew does not name **Bathsheba** directly but refers to her pointedly as "her who had been the wife of Uriah". This phrasing deliberately recalls the dark episode of David's adultery with Bathsheba and his subsequent murder of her faithful husband, Uriah the Hittite, to cover his sin (2 Samuel 11). The messianic line, therefore, proceeds directly from an act of adultery and murder, a stark reminder that God's grace operates not through human perfection but in spite of human depravity. From this union came  
    
    **Solomon**, David's successor, renowned for his wisdom and for building the first Temple, though his later life was marked by idolatry and excess.  
    
- **The Kings of Judah (vv. 7–11):** The list proceeds through the kings of the southern kingdom of Judah.
    
    - The line includes a mix of righteous and wicked kings. Figures like **Asa**, **Jehoshaphat**, **Hezekiah**, and **Josiah** were reformers who sought to follow God, though often imperfectly.  
        
    - They are interspersed with deeply wicked kings like **Rehoboam**, whose arrogance split the kingdom; **Jehoram**, who murdered his brothers; **Ahaz**, who engaged in child sacrifice; and **Manasseh**, whose sins were so great they were cited as the reason for Judah's eventual judgment.  
        
    - This unvarnished history of the monarchy demonstrates its ultimate failure. Despite God's covenant with David, the human kings consistently failed to live up to their calling, proving the need for a perfect, divine king.
        
- **The Omission of Kings:** To maintain his 14-14-14 structure, Matthew makes a notable omission between Jehoram and Uzziah, leaving out three successive kings: Ahaziah, Joash, and Amaziah (cf. 1 Chronicles 3:11–12). This selective editing underscores that Matthew's purpose is theological numerology, not a complete historical ledger. The omission may have an additional theological rationale: all three of these kings were direct descendants of the wicked King Ahab of Israel through his daughter Athaliah, who had married into Judah's royal line. By omitting them, Matthew may be symbolically purging the messianic line of the corrupting influence of the house of Ahab.

- **The End of the Monarchy (v. 11):** The section concludes with **Jeconiah** (also known as Jehoiachin) and his brothers "at the time of the exile to Babylon". This marks the end of the Davidic monarchy as a political entity in Jerusalem. Jeconiah is a critical figure, as the prophet Jeremiah pronounced a curse that none of his physical descendants would ever again prosper on David's throne (Jeremiah 22:28–30). This presents a significant theological problem for anyone claiming messiahship through this line.
