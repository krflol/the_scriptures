### Jesus the Messiah

The name and title that follow define the subject of this new genesis. The personal name, **Jesus**, is the Greek form of the common Hebrew name _Yeshua_ or _Yehoshua_. The name itself is a declaration of purpose, meaning "Yahweh saves" or simply "Salvation". The author immediately frames Jesus' identity around his salvific mission, a point the angel will make explicit in verse 21: "he will save his people from their sins". While the name was common in the first century, grounding Jesus in the historical reality of his time, Matthew imbues it with its fullest theological weight.  

The title, **Christ**, is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew word **Messiah** (_mashiach_), meaning "Anointed One". In the Old Testament, anointing with oil was the sacred rite that consecrated an individual for a divinely appointed office, primarily that of a king or high priest. Over centuries of foreign domination and political disappointment, the title became increasingly focused on the future, eschatological figure—an ideal king from David's line who would deliver Israel, restore its fortunes, and establish God's righteous rule on earth. Matthew's use of this title is an unambiguous declaration of Jesus' royal office and his fulfillment of Israel's deepest hopes.
