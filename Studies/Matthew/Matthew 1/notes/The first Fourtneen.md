### The First Fourteen Generations: The Patriarchal Foundation (vv. 2-6a)

This first section establishes the foundational lineage of Israel, tracing the line of promise from the nation's father to its greatest king.

- **The Patriarchs (vv. 2–3a):** The genealogy begins with the undisputed patriarchs of Israel. **Abraham** was called by God out of Ur of the Chaldeans to be the father of a new nation, receiving the covenant promise that he would be a blessing to all the earth. His son  
    
    **Isaac** was the child of that promise, miraculously born to Sarah in her old age and the subject of the ultimate test of Abraham's faith on Mount Moriah. Isaac's son  
    
    **Jacob**, whose name was changed to Israel after wrestling with God, was the father of the twelve sons who would become the twelve tribes of Israel. The line narrows to  
    
    **Judah**, Jacob's fourth son, to whom the prophecy of kingship was given: "The scepter will not depart from Judah" (Genesis 49:10). The inclusion of "and his brothers" acknowledges the unity of all twelve tribes as the people of God, even as the focus remains on the royal tribe.  
    
- **Scandal and Grace: Tamar and Rahab (vv. 3b, 5a):** Matthew's genealogy is remarkable for its inclusion of five women, a highly unusual practice in ancient patriarchal genealogies. The first two appear in this section, and their stories are fraught with scandal.
    
    - **Tamar (v. 3):** Judah's Canaanite daughter-in-law. After being unjustly widowed twice and then denied her legal right to marry Judah's third son, she disguised herself as a prostitute to solicit her father-in-law, Judah, thereby securing her place in the lineage (Genesis 38). Judah himself declared her "more righteous than I" (Genesis 38:26). Her inclusion demonstrates God's power to work His sovereign will even through human sin, deception, and brokenness to advance the line of promise.  
        
    - **Rahab (v. 5):** A Canaanite prostitute who lived in the city of Jericho. She expressed faith in the God of Israel and saved the lives of the Israelite spies, and in turn, she and her family were saved from the city's destruction (Joshua 2). Her inclusion as a Gentile and a woman with a sordid past signals from the very beginning of the Gospel that God's grace is not limited by ethnicity or moral failure.  
        
- **The Line to David (vv. 5b–6a):** The genealogy continues, linking the patriarchal era to the monarchy. **Boaz**, a righteous man from Bethlehem, married **Ruth**, the third woman mentioned.
    
    - **Ruth (v. 5):** A woman from Moab, a nation descended from Lot and traditionally an enemy of Israel. After being widowed, she demonstrated extraordinary loyalty (_hesed_) to her Israelite mother-in-law, Naomi, and embraced faith in Yahweh (Book of Ruth). Her story is another powerful testament to God's plan to include Gentiles in His story of redemption. Their son was  
        
        **Obed**, the father of **Jesse**, who in turn was the father of **David the King**. The section culminates with David, who is uniquely given the title "the king," cementing his status as the pivotal figure of this first epoch.
