### A Tale of Two Genealogies

A comprehensive study of Matthew's genealogy requires a comparison with the one found in Luke 3:23–38. While both trace Jesus' lineage to David, they do so in strikingly different ways, presenting not a contradiction but a complementary theological portrait.

- **Key Differences:** The two accounts diverge significantly after King David. Matthew traces the lineage through David's son **Solomon**, the royal line. Luke traces it through another of David's sons, **Nathan**, a non-royal line. Consequently, nearly all the names between David and Joseph are different. Furthermore, Matthew begins with Abraham and descends to Jesus, emphasizing his role as the fulfillment of Jewish history. Luke begins with Jesus and ascends all the way to Adam, emphasizing his role as the Savior of all humanity.

| **Joseph**                  | **Joseph**              |


- **Harmonizing the Accounts:** The most widely accepted explanation for these differences is that Matthew records the genealogy of **Joseph**, while Luke records the genealogy of **Mary**. In this view, Joseph is the "son of Heli" (Luke 3:23) by marriage, making Heli his father-in-law. This interpretation provides a powerful theological synthesis:  
    
    - **Matthew's Account (Joseph):** Establishes Jesus' **legal claim** to the throne of David. As Joseph's legally adopted son, Jesus inherits the royal rights passed down through the line of Solomon and the kings of Judah.
        
    - **Luke's Account (Mary):** Establishes Jesus' **physical bloodline** from David. Through his mother Mary, Jesus is a direct biological descendant of David, but through the non-regnal line of Nathan, which is not subject to the curse on Jeconiah's offspring.
        

Together, the two genealogies present a complete Christological picture. Jesus is the rightful King of the Jews by legal inheritance (Matthew) and the physical Son of David by blood (Luke), perfectly qualified to be the Messiah. They are not a biblical error to be explained away, but a sophisticated, two-part argument for the unique identity of Jesus Christ.
