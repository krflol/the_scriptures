Ezra
1:1  And in the first year of Koresh
sovereign of Persia, that the word of יהוה by the mouth
of Yirmeyah might be accomplished, יהוה stirred up the
spirit of Koresh sovereign of Persia, to proclaim throughout all his reign, and
also in writing, saying, 
Ezra
1:2  “Thus said Koresh sovereign of
Persia, ‘ יהוה Elohim of the heavens has given me all
the reigns of the earth. And He has commanded me to build Him a house in
Yerushalayim which is in Yehuḏah. 
Ezra
1:3  Who is among you of all His people?
His Elohim be with him! And let him go up to Yerushalayim, which is in Yehuḏah,
and build the House of יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl –
He is Elohim – which is in Yerushalayim. 
Ezra
1:4  And whoever is left from all the
places where he sojourns, let the men of his place help him with silver and
gold, with goods and livestock, besides the voluntary offerings for the House
of Elohim which is in Yerushalayim.’ ” 
Ezra
1:5  And the heads of the fathers’ houses of Yehuḏah and Binyamin,
and the priests and the Lĕwites, with all those whose spirits Elohim had
stirred, rose up to go up and build the House of יהוה
which is in Yerushalayim. 
Ezra
1:6  And all those round about them
strengthened their hands with objects of silver and gold, with goods and
livestock, and with valuables, besides all that was voluntarily offered. 
Ezra
1:7  And Sovereign Koresh brought out the
utensils of the House of יהוה, which Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar
had taken from Yerushalayim and put in the house of his mighty ones, 
Ezra
1:8  and Koresh sovereign of Persia
brought them out by the hand of Mithreḏath the treasurer, and counted
them out to Shĕshbatstsar the leader of Yehuḏah. 
Ezra
1:9  And this was their number: thirty
gold dishes, one thousand silver dishes, twenty-nine knives, 
Ezra
1:10  thirty gold basins, next, four
hundred and ten silver basins, one thousand other utensils. 
Ezra
1:11  All the utensils of gold and silver
were five thousand four hundred. Shĕshbatstsar took all of them with the
exiles who were brought from Baḇel to Yerushalayim. 
Ezra
2:1  And these are the sons of the

Ezra
2:58  All the Nethinim and the children
of Shelomoh’s servants were three hundred and ninety-two. 
Ezra
2:59  And these were those who came up
from Tĕl Melaḥ, Tĕl Ḥarsha, Kerub, Addan, Immĕr; but
they were unable to show their father’s house, and their seed, whether they
were of Yisra’ĕl: 
Ezra
2:60  sons of Delayah, sons of Toḇiyah,
sons of Neqoḏa, six hundred and fifty-two; 
Ezra
2:61  and of the sons of the priests:
sons of Ḥaḇayah, sons of Qots, sons of Barzillai, who took a wife
of the daughters of Barzillai the Gil‛aḏite, and was called by
their name. 
Ezra
2:62  These sought their register among those who were counted by
genealogy, but they were not found, so they were barred from the priesthood as defiled. 
Ezra
2:63  And the governor said to them that
they should not eat of the most set-apart gifts until there stood up a priest
with the Urim and Tummim. 
Ezra
2:64  The entire assembly was forty-two
thousand three hundred and sixty, 
Ezra
2:65  besides their male and female
servants – these were seven thousand three hundred and thirty-seven. They also

thirty-six, their mules two hundred and forty-five, 
Ezra
2:67  their camels four hundred and
thirty-five, donkeys six thousand seven hundred and twenty. 
Ezra
2:68  And some of the heads of the
fathers’ houses, when they came to the House of יהוה
which is in Yerushalayim, offered voluntarily for the House of Elohim, to establish
it in its place. 
Ezra
2:69  They gave according to their
ability to the treasury for the work sixty-one thousand gold drachmas, and five
thousand minas of silver, and one hundred priestly garments. 
Ezra
2:70  And the priests and the Lĕwites,
and some of the people, and the singers, and the gatekeepers, and the Nethinim,
dwelt in their cities, and all Yisra’ĕl in their cities. 
Ezra
3:1  Now when the seventh month came, and
the children of Yisra’ĕl were in the cities, the people gathered as one man
to Yerushalayim. 
Ezra
3:2  And Yĕshua son of Yotsaḏaq
and his brothers the priests, and Zerubbaḇel son of She’alti’ĕl and
his brothers, arose and built the altar of the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, to
offer burnt offerings on it, as it is written in the Torah of Mosheh, the man
of Elohim. 
Ezra
3:3  So they set the altar on its stands,
being afraid of the peoples of the lands. And they offered burnt offerings on
it to יהוה, both the morning and evening burnt
offerings. 
Ezra
3:4  And they performed the Festival of
Booths, as it is written, and the daily burnt offerings by number, according to
the right-ruling for each day, 
Ezra
3:5  and afterward the continual burnt
offering, and those for New Moons and for all the appointed times of יהוה
that were set-apart, also for everyone who volunteered a voluntary offering to יהוה.

Ezra
3:6  From the first day of the seventh
month they began to offer burnt offerings to יהוה. But
the foundation of the Hĕḵal of יהוה had not
been laid. 
Ezra
3:7  And they gave silver to the stonemasons
and the carpenters, and food, and drink, and oil to the people of Tsiḏon
and Tsor to bring cedar logs from Leḇanon to the sea at Yapho, according
to the permission which they had from Koresh sovereign of Persia. 
Ezra
3:8  And in the second month of the
second year of their coming to the House of Elohim, to Yerushalayim, Zerubbaḇel
son of She’alti’ĕl, and Yĕshua son of Yotsaḏaq, and the rest of
their brothers the priests and the Lĕwites, and all those who had come out
of the captivity to Yerushalayim, began, and they appointed the Lĕwites
from twenty years old and above to oversee the work of the House of יהוה.

Ezra
3:9  And Yĕshua stood up, his sons
and his brothers, Qadmi’ĕl with his sons, the sons of Yehuḏah
together, to oversee those working on the House of Elohim: the sons of Ḥĕnaḏaḏ
with their sons and their brothers the Lĕwites. 
Ezra
3:10  And when the builders laid the
foundation of the Hĕḵal of יהוה, they
appointed the priests in their robes, with trumpets, and the Lĕwites, the
sons of Asaph, with cymbals, to praise יהוה, after the
order of Dawiḏ sovereign of Yisra’ĕl. 
Ezra
3:11  And they responded by praising and
giving thanks to יהוה, “For He is good, for His
kindness towards Yisra’ĕl is forever.” And all the people shouted with a
great shout, when they praised יהוה, because the
foundation of the House of יהוה was laid. 
Ezra
3:12  And many of the priests and Lĕwites
and heads of the fathers’ houses, the
old men who had seen the first House, wept with a loud voice when the
foundation of this House was laid before their eyes, and many shouted aloud for
joy, 
Ezra
3:13  and the people could not
distinguish the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the
people, for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the sound was heard far
away. 
Ezra
4:1  And when the adversaries of Yehuḏah
and Binyamin heard that the sons of the exile were building the Hĕḵal
of יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, 
Ezra
4:2  they came to Zerubbaḇel and
the heads of the fathers’ houses and
said to them, “Let us build with you, for we seek your Elohim as you do. And we
have slaughtered to Him since the days of Ĕsarḥaddon sovereign of
Ashshur, who brought us here.” 
Ezra
4:3  But Zerubbaḇel and Yĕshua
and the rest of the heads of the fathers’ houses
of Yisra’ĕl said to them, “It is not for you and for us to build a house
for our Elohim, but we alone build to יהוה Elohim of
Yisra’ĕl, as Sovereign Koresh the sovereign of Persia has commanded us.” 
Ezra
4:4  And it came to be that the people of
the land were weakening the hands of the people of Yehuḏah and troubling
them in their building, 
Ezra
4:5  and hiring counsellors against them
to thwart their plans all the days of Koresh sovereign of Persia, even until
the reign of Dareyawesh sovereign of Persia. 
Ezra
4:6  And in the reign of Aḥashwĕrosh,
in the beginning of his reign, they wrote an accusation against the inhabitants
of Yehuḏah and Yerushalayim. 
Ezra
4:7  And in the days of
Artaḥshashta, Bishlam, Mithreḏath, Taḇe’ĕl, and the rest
of their companions wrote to Artaḥshashta sovereign of Persia. And the
letter was written in Aramaic, and translated from Aramaic. 
Ezra
4:8  Reḥum the governor and
Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Yerushalayim to Sovereign Artaḥshashta,
thus: 
Ezra
4:9  Reḥum the governor, and
Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions – the judges, and the
emissaries, the consuls, the officials, the people of Ereḵ and of Baḇel
and of Shushan, the Dehawites, the Ĕylamites, 
Ezra
4:10  and the rest of the nations whom
the great and noble Osnapper took into exile and settled in the cities of
Shomeron and the rest beyond the River. And now, 
Ezra
4:11  this is a copy of the letter that
they sent him, to Sovereign Artaḥshashta from your servants the men
beyond the River. And now, 
Ezra
4:12  let it be known to the sovereign
that the Yehuḏim who came up from you have come to us at Yerushalayim,
and are building the rebellious and evil city, and are completing its walls and
repairing the foundations. 
Ezra
4:13  Now let it now be known to the
sovereign that, if this city is built and the walls completed, they are not
going to pay tax, excise, or toll, and cause the revenue of the sovereign to
suffer loss. 
Ezra
4:14  Now, because we have eaten salt
from the palace, it was not fitting for us to see the sovereign’s shame.
Therefore we have sent and informed the sovereign, 
Ezra
4:15  so that search be made in the book
of the records of your fathers, and you find in the book of the records, and
know, that this city is a rebellious city, and causing loss to sovereigns and
provinces. And revolt was stirred up in it since days of old, for which cause
this city was destroyed. 
Ezra
4:16  We inform the sovereign that if
this city is rebuilt and its walls are completed, then you have no portion
beyond the River. 
Ezra
4:17  The sovereign sent a message: To
Reḥum the governor, and Shimshai the scribe, to the rest of their
companions who dwell in Shomeron, and the rest beyond the River: Peace! And
now, 
Ezra
4:18  the letter you sent to us has been
plainly read before me. 
Ezra
4:19  And I made the decree, and a search
has been made, and it was found that this city in days of old has lifted up
itself against sovereigns, and that rebellion and revolt have been made in it. 
Ezra
4:20  And mighty sovereigns have been
over Yerushalayim, who have ruled over all beyond the River. And tax, excise,
and toll were paid to them. 
Ezra
4:21  Now, make a decree to make these
men cease, and that this city be not built until the command is given by me. 
Ezra
4:22  And beware of negligence to do
this. Why should damage increase to the hurt of the sovereigns? 
Ezra
4:23  Now when the copy of the letter of
Sovereign Artaḥshashta was read before Reḥum, and Shimshai the scribe,
and their companions, they went up in a hurry to Yerushalayim against the Yehuḏim,
and made them cease by might and power. 
Ezra
4:24  Then the work of the House of Elah
which is at Yerushalayim ceased, and it ceased until the second year of the
reign of Dareyawesh sovereign of Persia. 
Ezra
5:1  Then the prophets, Ḥaggai the
prophet and Zeḵaryah son of Iddo, prophesied to the Yehuḏim who
were in Yehuḏah and Yerushalayim, in the Name of the Elah of Yisra’ĕl
upon them. 
Ezra
5:2  Then Zerubbaḇel son of She’alti’ĕl
and Yĕshua son of Yotsaḏaq rose up and began to build the House of
Elah which is in Yerushalayim. And the prophets of Elah were with them, helping
them. 
Ezra
5:3  At that time Tattenai the governor
beyond the River and Shethar-Bozenai and their companions came to them and said
this to them, “Who has made you a decree to build this House and to complete
this wall?” 
Ezra
5:4  Then we told them what the names
were of the men who were building this building. 
Ezra
5:5  And the eye of their Elah was upon
the elders of the Yehuḏim, so that they could not make them cease until
the matter went to Dareyawesh. And then they sent back a letter concerning
this. 
Ezra
5:6  This is a copy of the letter that
Tattenai, governor beyond the River, had sent, and Shethar-Bozenai, and his
companions the officials beyond the River, to Dareyawesh the sovereign. 
Ezra
5:7  They sent a letter to him, and this
was written in it: To Dareyawesh the sovereign: All peace. 
Ezra
5:8  Let it be known to the sovereign
that we went into the province of Yehuḏah, to the House of the great
Elah, which is being built with heavy stones, and timber is being laid in the
walls. And this work goes on speedily and is blessed in their hands. 
Ezra
5:9  Then we asked those elders, saying
this to them, “Who made you a decree to build this House and to complete these
walls?” 
Ezra
5:10  And we also asked them their names,
in order to inform you, so we could write the names of the men at their head. 
Ezra
5:11  And this is the answer they gave us,
saying, “We are the servants of the Elah of heaven and earth, and we are
rebuilding the House that was built many years ago, which a great sovereign of
Yisra’ĕl built and completed. 
Ezra
5:12  “But because our fathers provoked
the Elah of heaven, He gave them into the hand of Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar
sovereign of Baḇel, the Chaldean, who destroyed this House and exiled the
people to Baḇel. 
Ezra
5:13  “But in the first year of Koresh
sovereign of Baḇel, Koresh the sovereign made a decree to build this
House of Elah. 
Ezra
5:14  “And also, the gold and silver
utensils of the House of Elah, which Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar had
taken from the Hĕḵal that was in Yerushalayim and brought to the hĕḵal
of Baḇel, those Sovereign Koresh took from the hĕḵal of Baḇel
and they were given to one named Shĕshbatstsar, whom he had made governor,

Ezra
5:15  and said to him, ‘Take these
utensils, go, deposit them in the Hĕḵal in Yerushalayim, and let the
House of Elah be built on its place.’ 
Ezra
5:16  “Then the same Shĕshbatstsar
came, laid the foundation of the House of Elah which is in Yerushalayim, and
since that time even until now it has been in building, and it is not
completed.” 
Ezra
5:17  And now, if it seems good to the
sovereign, let a search be made in the sovereign’s treasure-house, which is
there in Baḇel, whether it is so that a decree was made by Sovereign
Koresh to build this House of Elah at Yerushalayim, and let the sovereign send
us his decision concerning this. 
Ezra
6:1  Then Dareyawesh the sovereign made a
decree, and a search was made in the house of the books wherein also the
treasures of Baḇel were kept. 
Ezra
6:2  And at Aḥmetha, in the palace
which is in the province of Media, a scroll was found, and this was written in
it: 
Ezra
6:3  In the first year of Sovereign
Koresh, Sovereign Koresh made a decree concerning the House of Elah at
Yerushalayim, “Let the house be built in the place where they brought
offerings, and its foundations strongly laid, its height sixty cubits, its
width sixty cubits, 
Ezra
6:4  three rows of heavy stones and one
row of new timber. Let the expenses be paid from the sovereign’s house. 
Ezra
6:5  “And let the gold and silver
utensils of the House of Elah, which Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar took from
the Hĕḵal which is in Yerushalayim and brought to Baḇel, be
returned and go to the Hĕḵal which is in Yerushalayim, to its place,
and deposit them in the House of Elah,” 
Ezra
6:6  Now, Tattenai, governor beyond the
River, and Shethar-Bozenai, and your companions the officials beyond the River,
stay away from there. 
Ezra
6:7  Leave the work of this House of Elah
alone. Let the governor of the Yehuḏim and the elders of the Yehuḏim
build this House of Elah on its place. 
Ezra
6:8  And I make a decree as to what you
should do for the elders of these Yehuḏim, for the building of this House
of Elah: Let the exact expense be paid to these men from the sovereign’s
resources, out of the taxes beyond the River, so that they are not stopped. 
Ezra
6:9  And whatever they need – both young
bulls and rams, and lambs for the burnt offerings of the Elah of heaven, wheat,
salt, wine, and oil, according to the request of the priests who are in
Yerushalayim – let it be given them day by day without fail, 
Ezra
6:10  so that they bring pleasing
offerings to the Elah of heaven, and pray for the life of the sovereign and his
sons. 
Ezra
6:11  And I make a decree that whoever
changes this word, let a timber be pulled from his house, and let him be
impaled, hanged on it. And let his house be made a dunghill because of this. 
Ezra
6:12  And Elah, who has caused His Name
to dwell there does overthrow any sovereign or people who put their hand to
change, to destroy this House of Elah which is in Yerushalayim! I Dareyawesh
make the decree – let it be done promptly. 
Ezra
6:13  Then Tattenai, governor beyond the
River, Shethar-Bozenai, and their companions promptly did according to what
Dareyawesh the sovereign had sent. 
Ezra
6:14  And the elders of the Yehuḏim
were building, and they were blessed through the prophesying of Ḥaggai
the prophet and Zeḵaryah son of Iddo. And they built and finished it,
according to the decree of the Elah of Yisra’ĕl, and according to the
decree of Koresh, and Dareyawesh, and Artaḥshashta sovereign of Persia. 
Ezra
6:15  And this House was completed on the
third day of the month of Aḏar, which was in the sixth year of the reign
of Sovereign Dareyawesh. 
Ezra
6:16  Then the children of Yisra’ĕl,
the priests and the Lĕwites and the rest of the sons of the exile, did the
dedication of this House of Elah with joy, 
Ezra
6:17  and offered at the dedication of
this House of Elah one hundred bulls, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs, and
as a sin offering for all Yisra’ĕl twelve male goats, according to the
number of the tribes of Yisra’ĕl. 
Ezra
6:18  And they appointed the priests to
their divisions and the Lĕwites to their divisions, over the service of
Elah in Yerushalayim, as it is written in the Book of Mosheh. 
Ezra
6:19  And the sons of the exile performed
the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month, 
Ezra
6:20  for the priests and the Lĕwites
had cleansed themselves – all of them were clean. And they slaughtered the
Passover for all the sons of the exile, and for their brothers the priests, and
for themselves. 
Ezra
6:21  And the children of Yisra’ĕl
who had returned from the exile ate together with all who had separated
themselves from the uncleanness of the gentiles of the land in order to seek יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl. 
Ezra
6:22  And they performed the Festival of
Unleavened Bread seven days with joy, for יהוה caused
them to rejoice, and turned the heart of the sovereign of Ashshur toward them,
to strengthen their hands in the work of the House of Elohim, the Elohim of
Yisra’ĕl. 
Ezra
7:1  And after these events, in the reign
of Artaḥshashta sovereign of Persia, Ezra son of Serayah, son of Azaryah,
son of Ḥilqiyah, 
Ezra
7:2  son of Shallum, son of Tsaḏoq,
son of Aḥituḇ, 
Ezra
7:3  son of Amaryah, son of Azaryah, son
of Merayoth, 
Ezra
7:4  son of Zeraḥyah, son of Uzzi,
son of Buqqi, 
Ezra
7:5  son of Aḇishua, son of
Phineḥas, son of El‛azar, son of Aharon the chief priest – 
Ezra
7:6  this Ezra came up from Baḇel.
And he was a scribe, skilled in the Torah of Mosheh, which יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl had given. And the sovereign gave him all he asked,
according to the hand of יהוה his Elohim upon him. 
Ezra
7:7  And some of the children of Yisra’ĕl,
and the priests, and the Lĕwites, and the singers, and the gatekeepers,
and the Nethinim came up to Yerushalayim in the seventh year of Sovereign
Artaḥshashta. 
Ezra
7:8  And he came to Yerushalayim in the
fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the sovereign. 
Ezra
7:9  For on the first day of the first month he began to go up
from Baḇel, and on the first day of the fifth month he came to
Yerushalayim, according to the good hand of his Elohim upon him. 
Ezra
7:10  For Ezra had prepared his heart to
seek the Torah of יהוה, and to do it, and to teach laws
and right-rulings in Yisra’ĕl. 
Ezra
7:11  And this is the copy of the letter
that Sovereign Artaḥshashta gave Ezra the priest, the scribe, a scribe in
the words of the commands of יהוה, and of His laws to
Yisra’ĕl: 
Ezra
7:12  Artaḥshashta, sovereign of
sovereigns, to Ezra the priest, a perfect scribe of the law of the Elah of
heaven. And now, 
Ezra
7:13  I make a decree that all those of
the people of Yisra’ĕl and the priests and Lĕwites in my reign, who
volunteer to go up to Yerushalayim, go with you. 
Ezra
7:14  Since you are being sent by the
sovereign and his seven counsellors to inquire about Yehuḏah and
Yerushalayim, with regard to the law of your Elah which is in your hand; 
Ezra
7:15  and to bring the silver and gold
which the sovereign and his counsellors have voluntarily given to the Elah of
Yisra’ĕl, whose dwelling is in Yerushalayim, 
Ezra
7:16  and all the silver and gold that
you find in all the province of Baḇel, along with the gift of the people
and the priests, voluntarily given for the House of their Elah in Yerushalayim,

Ezra
7:17  therefore, with this silver
promptly buy bulls, rams, lambs, with their grain offerings and their drink
offerings, and offer them on the altar of the House of your Elah in
Yerushalayim. 
Ezra
7:18  And whatever seems good to you and
your brothers to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, do it according
to the desire of your Elah. 
Ezra
7:19  And the utensils that are given to
you for the service of the House of your Elah, put back before the Elah of
Yerushalayim. 
Ezra
7:20  And the rest of the needs for the
House of your Elah, which falls to you to give, give from the sovereign’s
treasure-house. 
Ezra
7:21  And I, I Artaḥshashta the
sovereign, do make a decree to all the treasurers who are beyond the River,
that whatever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the Elah of heaven,
does ask of you, let it be done promptly, 
Ezra
7:22  up to one hundred talents of
silver, and up to one hundred kors of wheat, and up to one hundred baths of
wine, and up to one hundred baths of oil, and salt without reckoning. 
Ezra
7:23  Whatever is commanded by the Elah
of heaven, let it be diligently done for the House of the Elah of heaven. For
why should there be wrath against the reign of the sovereign and his sons? 
Ezra
7:24  We further inform you that there is
no authority to impose tax, excise, or toll on any of the priests and Lĕwites,
singers, gatekeepers, Nethinim, and servants of this House of Elah. 
Ezra
7:25  And you, Ezra, according to the
wisdom of your Elah that is in your hand, appoint magistrates and judges to
judge all the people who are beyond the River, all such as know the laws of
your Elah. And teach those who do not know them. 
Ezra
7:26  And whoever does not do the law of
your Elah and the law of the sovereign, let judgment be promptly executed on
him, whether it be death, or banishment, or confiscation of goods, or
imprisonment. 
Ezra
7:27  Blessed be יהוה
Elohim of our fathers, who has put this in the sovereign’s heart, to embellish
the House of יהוה which is in Yerushalayim, 
Ezra
7:28  and has extended kindness to me
before the sovereign and his counsellors, and before all the sovereign’s mighty
princes. So I was strengthened, as the hand of יהוה my
Elohim was upon me. And I gathered heads from Yisra’ĕl to go up with me. 
Ezra
8:1  These are the heads of their fathers’
houses, and this is the genealogy of
those who went up with me from Baḇel, in the reign of Sovereign
Artaḥshashta: 
Ezra
8:2  of the sons of Phineḥas, Gĕreshom;
of the sons of Ithamar, Dani’ĕl; of the sons of Dawiḏ, Ḥattush;

Ezra
8:3  of the sons of Sheḵanyah, of
the sons of Parosh, Zeḵaryah, and registered with him were one hundred
and fifty males; 
Ezra
8:4  of the sons of Paḥath-Mo’aḇ,
Elyeho‛ĕynai son of Zeraḥyah, and with him two hundred males; 
Ezra
8:5  of the sons of Sheḵanyah, the
son of Yaḥazi’ĕl, and with him three hundred males; 
Ezra
8:6  and of the sons of Aḏin, Eḇeḏ
son of Yehonathan, and with him fifty males; 
Ezra
8:7  and of the sons of Ĕylam,
Yeshayah son of Athalyah, and with him seventy males; 
Ezra
8:8  and of the sons of Shephatyah, Zeḇaḏyah
son of Miḵa’ĕl, and with him eighty males; 
Ezra
8:9  of the sons of Yo’aḇ, Oḇaḏyah
son of Yeḥi’ĕl, and with him two hundred and eighteen males; 
Ezra
8:10  and of the sons of Shelomith, the
son of Yosiphyah, and with him one hundred and sixty males; 
Ezra
8:11  and of the sons of Bĕḇai,
Zeḵaryah son of Bĕḇai, and with him twenty-eight males; 
Ezra
8:12  and of the sons of Azgaḏ,
Yoḥanan son of Haqqatan, and with him one hundred and ten males; 
Ezra
8:13  and of the last sons of Aḏoniqam,
whose names are these; Eliphelet, Ye‛i’ĕl, and Shemayah, and with
them sixty males; 
Ezra
8:14  and of the sons of Biḡwai,
Uthai and Zabbuḏ, and with them seventy males. 
Ezra
8:15  And I assembled them at the river
that flows to Ahawa, and we camped there three days. And I looked among the
people and the priests, and did not find any of the sons of Lĕwi there. 
Ezra
8:16  Then I sent for Eli‛ezer, for
Ari’ĕl, for Shemayah, and for Elnathan, and for Yariḇ, and for
Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zeḵaryah, and for Meshullam, leaders –
also for Yoyariḇ and Elnathan, men of understanding. 
Ezra
8:17  And I gave them a command for Iddo
the chief man at the place Kasiphya, and put in their mouth words to speak to
Iddo and his brothers the Nethinim at the place Kasiphya, to bring us servants
for the House of our Elohim. 
Ezra
8:18  Then, by the good hand of our
Elohim upon us, they brought us a man of understanding, of the sons of
Maḥli son of Lĕwi, son of Yisra’ĕl, and Shĕrĕḇyah,
with his sons and brothers, eighteen; 
Ezra
8:19  and Ḥashaḇyah, and with
him Yeshayah of the sons of Merari, his brothers and their sons, twenty; 
Ezra
8:20  and of the Nethinim, whom Dawiḏ
and the leaders had appointed for the service of the Lĕwites, two hundred
and twenty Nethinim, all of them designated by name. 
Ezra
8:21  I then proclaimed a fast there, at
the river of Ahawa, to humble ourselves before our Elohim, to seek from Him the
right way for us and our little ones and all our possessions, 
Ezra
8:22  for I was ashamed to ask of the
sovereign a group of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy on the
way, because we had spoken to the sovereign, saying, “The hand of our Elohim is
upon all those for good who seek Him, but His power and His wrath are against
all those who forsake Him.” 
Ezra
8:23  So we fasted and prayed to our
Elohim for this, and He answered our prayer. 
Ezra
8:24  And I separated twelve of the
leaders of the priests: Shĕrĕḇyah, Ḥashaḇyah, and
ten of their brothers with them; 
Ezra
8:25  and weighed out to them the silver,
and the gold, and the utensils, the contribution for the House of our Elohim
which the sovereign and his counsellors and his heads, and all Yisra’ĕl
who were there, had presented. 
Ezra
8:26  Thus I weighed into their hand six
hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver objects of one hundred talents,
one hundred talents of gold, 
Ezra
8:27  and twenty gold basins of a
thousand drachmas, and two utensils of fine polished bronze, precious as gold. 
Ezra
8:28  And I said to them, “You are
set-apart to יהוה, and the objects are set-apart. And
the silver and the gold are a voluntary offering to יהוה
Elohim of your fathers. 
Ezra
8:29  “Watch and guard them until you
weigh them before the leaders of the priests and the Lĕwites and heads of
the fathers’ houses of Yisra’ĕl
in Yerushalayim, in the rooms of the House of יהוה.” 
Ezra
8:30  So the priests and the Lĕwites
took the weight of the silver and the gold and the utensils, to bring them to
Yerushalayim to the House of our Elohim. 
Ezra
8:31  Then we set out from the Ahawa
River on the twelfth of the first month, to go to Yerushalayim. And the hand of
our Elohim was upon us, and He delivered us from the hand of the enemy and from
ambush along the way. 
Ezra
8:32  And when we came to Yerushalayim,
we dwelt there three days. 
Ezra
8:33  And on the fourth day the silver
and the gold and the utensils were weighed in the House of our Elohim by the
hand of Merĕmoth son of Uriyah the priest, and with him was El‛azar
son of Phineḥas. And with them were the Lĕwites, Yozaḇaḏ
son of Yĕshua and No‛aḏyah son of Binnui, 
Ezra
8:34  with the number and weight of all.
And all the weight was written down at that time. 
Ezra
8:35  The sons of the exile, who had come
from the captivity, brought burnt offerings to the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl:
twelve bulls for all Yisra’ĕl, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, and
twelve male goats as a sin offering – all as a burnt offering to יהוה.

Ezra
8:36  And they gave the sovereign’s orders
to the sovereign’s viceroys and the governors beyond the River. And they lifted
up the people and the House of Elohim. 
Ezra
9:1  And when these matters had been done, the leaders came to me, saying, “The people
of Yisra’ĕl and the priests and the Lĕwites have not separated
themselves from the peoples of the lands, as to their abominations, those of the Kena‛anites, the Ḥittites,
the Perizzites, the Yeḇusites, the Ammonites, the Mo’aḇites, the
Mitsrites, and the Amorites, 
Ezra
9:2  for they have taken some of their
daughters as wives for themselves and their sons, so that the set-apart seed is
intermingled with the peoples of those lands. And the hand of the leaders and
rulers has been foremost in this trespass.” 
Ezra
9:3  And when I heard this word, I tore
my garment and my robe, and plucked out some of the hair of my head and beard,
and sat down astonished. 
Ezra
9:4  Then all those who trembled at the
words of the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl gathered to me, because of the trespass of
the exiles, and I sat astonished until the evening offering. 
Ezra
9:5  And at the evening offering I rose
from my affliction. And having torn my garment and my robe, I fell on my knees
and spread out my hands to יהוה my Elohim, 
Ezra
9:6  and said, “O my Elohim, I am too
ashamed and wounded to lift up my face to You, my Elohim, for our crookednesses
have risen higher than our heads, and our guilt has grown up to the heavens. 
Ezra
9:7  “Since the days of our fathers to
this day we have been very guilty, and for our crookednesses we, our
sovereigns, and our priests have been given into the hand of the sovereigns of
the lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to plunder, and to shame of faces,
as it is this day. 
Ezra
9:8  “But now, for a short while, favour
has been shown from יהוה our Elohim, to leave us a
remnant to escape, and to give us a peg in His set-apart place, that our Elohim
might enlighten our eyes and give us a little reviving in our bondage. 
Ezra
9:9  “For we were slaves, but in our
bondage our Elohim did not forsake us, and extended kindness to us in the
presence of the sovereigns of Persia, to revive us, to raise up the House of
our Elohim, to restore its ruins, and to give us a wall in Yehuḏah and
Yerushalayim. 
Ezra
9:10  “And now, O our Elohim, what do we
say after this? For we have forsaken Your commands, 
Ezra
9:11  which You have commanded by Your
servants the prophets, saying, ‘The land which you are going in to possess is a
land unclean through the uncleanness of the peoples of the lands, by their
abominations with which they have filled it, from one end to another, by their
uncleanness. 
Ezra
9:12  ‘And now, do not give your
daughters as wives for their sons, nor take their daughters to your sons. And
do not seek their peace or wealth ever, so that you are strong, and shall eat
the good of the land, and leave it as an inheritance to your children forever.’

Ezra
9:13  “And after all that has come upon
us for our evil deeds and for our great guilt, since You our Elohim have held
back the rod upon our crookednesses, and have given us such deliverance as
this, 
Ezra
9:14  should we turn back, to break Your
commands, and join in marriage with the people of these abominations? Would You
not be enraged with us until You had consumed us, so that there would be no
remnant or survivor? 
Ezra
9:15  “O יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, You are righteous, for we are left as a remnant, as it
is this day. See, we are before You, in our guilt, for there is no one to stand
before You concerning this!” 
Ezra
10:1  And while Ezra was praying, and
while he was confessing, weeping, and bowing down before the House of Elohim, a
very large assembly – men and women and children – gathered unto him from Yisra’ĕl,
for the people wept very bitterly. 
Ezra
10:2  And Sheḵanyah son of
Yeḥi’ĕl, one of the sons of Olam, spoke up and said to Ezra, “We
have trespassed against our Elohim, and have taken foreign women from the
peoples of the land. And now there is expectancy in Yisra’ĕl concerning
this. 
Ezra
10:3  “Now then, let us make a covenant
with our Elohim to put away all these wives and those who have been born to
them, according to the counsel of יהוה and of those who
tremble at the command of our Elohim. And let it be done according to the
Torah. 
Ezra
10:4  “Arise, for the matter is upon you,
but we are with you. Be strong and act.” 
Ezra
10:5  And Ezra rose, and made the leaders
of the priests, the Lĕwites, and all Yisra’ĕl, to swear to do
according to this word. And they swore. 
Ezra
10:6  Then Ezra rose up from before the
House of Elohim, and went into the room of Yehoḥanan son of Elyashiḇ.
And he went there – he ate no bread and drank no water for he mourned because
of the trespass of the exiles. 
Ezra
10:7  And they passed a call throughout
Yehuḏah and Yerushalayim to all the sons of the exile, to gather at
Yerushalayim, 
Ezra
10:8  and that whoever would not come
within three days, according to the counsel of the leaders and elders, all his
goods would be put under a ban, and himself separated from the assembly of the
exiles. 
Ezra
10:9  Then all the men of Yehuḏah
and Binyamin gathered at Yerushalayim within three days. It was the ninth
month, on the twentieth of the month. And all the people sat in the open space
of the House of Elohim, trembling because of the matter and because of showers
of rain. 
Ezra
10:10  And Ezra the priest stood up and
said to them, “You, you have trespassed and have taken foreign women, adding to
the guilt of Yisra’ĕl. 
Ezra
10:11  “And now, make confession to יהוה
Elohim of your fathers, and do His desire, and separate yourselves from the
peoples of the land, and from the foreign women.” 
Ezra
10:12  And all the assembly answered and
said with a loud voice, “Right! It is upon us to do according to your word. 
Ezra
10:13  “But the people are many, and it
is the season of showers of rain, and we are not able to stand outside. And the
work not of one or two days, for we have greatly transgressed in this matter. 
Ezra
10:14  “Please, let the leaders of all
the assembly stand. And let all those in our cities who have taken foreign
women come at appointed times, together with the elders and judges of their
cities, until the burning wrath of our Elohim is turned away from us in this
matter.” 
Ezra
10:15  Only Yonathan son of Asah’ĕl
and Yaḥzeyah son of Tiqwah opposed this, and Meshullam and Shabbethai the
Lĕwite gave them support. 
Ezra
10:16  Then the sons of the exile did so.
And Ezra the priest, with certain heads of the fathers’ houses, were separated by the fathers’ houses, each of them by name. And they sat down on the first day of
the tenth month to examine the matter. 
Ezra
10:17  And they finished with all the men
who had taken foreign women by the first day of the second month. 
Ezra
10:18  And among the sons of the priests
who had taken foreign women were found of the sons of Yĕshua son of Yotsaḏaq,
and his brothers: Ma‛asĕyah, and Eli‛ezer, and Yariḇ,
and Geḏalyah. 
Ezra
10:19  And they gave their hand in pledge to put away their wives. And
being guilty, they presented a ram of the flock for their guilt. 
Ezra
10:20  And of the sons of Immĕr: Ḥanani
and Zeḇaḏyah; 
Ezra
10:21  and of the sons of Ḥarim: Ma‛asĕyah,
and Ĕliyah, and Shemayah, and Yeḥi’ĕl, and Uzziyah; 
Ezra
10:22  and of the sons of Pashhur: Elyo‛ĕynai,
Ma‛asĕyah, Yishma‛ĕl, Nethanĕ’l, Yozaḇaḏ,
and El‛asah. 
Ezra
10:23  And of the Lĕwites: Yozaḇaḏ,
Shim‛i, Qĕlayah – he is Qelita – Pethaḥyah, Yehuḏah, and
Eli‛ezer. 
Ezra
10:24  And of the singers: Elyashiḇ.
And of the gatekeepers: Shallum, and Telem, and Uri. 
Ezra
10:25  And of Yisra’ĕl of the sons
of Parosh: Ramyah, and Yizziyah, and Malkiyah, and Miyamin, and El‛azar,
and Malkiyah, and Benayah; 
Ezra
10:26  and of the sons of Ĕylam:

and Ĕliyah;

10:27  and of the sons of Zattu: Elyo‛ĕynai,
Elyashiḇ, Mattanyah, and Yerĕmoth, and Zaḇaḏ, and Aziza;

Ezra
10:28  and of the sons of Bĕḇai:

10:29  and of the sons of Bani:
Meshullam, Malluḵ, and Aḏayah, Yashuḇ, and She’al, Ramoth;

and Binnui, and Menashsheh; 
Ezra
10:31  and of the sons of Ḥarim:
Eli‛ezer, Yishshiyah, Malkiyah, Shemayah, Shim‛on, 
Ezra
10:32  Binyamin, Malluḵ, and
Shemaryah; 
Ezra
10:33  of the sons of Ḥashum:
Mattenai, Mattattah, Zaḇaḏ, Eliphelet, Yerĕmai, Menashsheh,
and Shim‛i; 
Ezra
10:34  of the sons of Bani: Ma‛aḏai,
Amram, and U’ĕl, 
Ezra
10:35  Benayah, Bĕḏeyah,
Keluhu, 
Ezra
10:36  Wanyah, Merĕmoth, Elyashiḇ,

Ezra
10:37  Mattanyah, Mattenai, and Ya‛asu,

Ezra
10:38  and Bani, and Binnui, Shim‛i,

Ezra
10:39  and Shelemyah, and Nathan, and Aḏayah,

and some of them had women who had borne children.
