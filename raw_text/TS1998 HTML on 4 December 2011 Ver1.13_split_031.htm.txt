Isaiah
33:22  for יהוה
is our Judge, יהוה is our Lawgiver, יהוה
is our Sovereign, He saves us – 
Isaiah
33:23  your ropes shall be slack, they do
not strengthen their mast, they shall not spread the sail. Then the prey of
great plunder shall be divided, the lame shall take the prey. 
Isaiah
33:24  Neither shall the inhabitant say, “I
am sick.” The people who dwell in it is forgiven their crookedness! 
Isaiah
34:1  Come near, you gentiles, to hear.
And listen, you people! Let the earth hear, and all that is in it, the world
and all its offspring. 
Isaiah
34:2  For the displeasure of יהוה
is against all the gentiles, and His wrath against all their divisions. He
shall put them under the ban, He shall give them over to the slaughter,
Isaiah
34:3  and their slain be thrown out, and
their stench rise from their corpses. And mountains shall be melted with their
blood. 
Isaiah
34:4  And all the host of the heavens
shall rot away. And the heavens shall be rolled up like a scroll, and all their
host fade like a leaf fading on the vine, and like the fading one of a fig
tree. 
Isaiah
34:5  “For My sword shall be drenched in
the heavens. Look, it comes down on Eḏom, and on the people of My curse,
for judgment. 
Isaiah
34:6  “The sword of יהוה
shall be filled with blood, it shall be made overflowing with fatness, and with
the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams. For יהוה
has a slaughtering in Botsrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Eḏom.

Isaiah
34:7  “And wild oxen shall come down with
them, and young bulls with bulls. And their land shall be drenched with blood,
and their dust made fat with fatness.” 
Isaiah
34:8  For it is the day of the vengeance
of יהוה, the year of recompense for the cause of
Tsiyon. 
Isaiah
34:9  And its streams shall be turned
into tar, and its dust into sulphur, and its land shall become burning tar, 
Isaiah
34:10  that is not quenched night or day,
its smoke going up forever. From generation to generation it lies waste, no one
passes through it forever and ever, 
Isaiah
34:11  so that the pelican and the
porcupine possess it, also the owl and the raven dwell in it. And He shall
stretch out over it the line of formlessness and stones of emptiness. 
Isaiah
34:12  Its caves, with no one in them, is
called a reign, but all its rulers have vanished. 
Isaiah
34:13  And thorns shall come up in its
palaces, nettles and brambles in its strongholds. And it shall be a home for
jackals, a courtyard for ostriches. 
Isaiah
34:14  And the wild beasts of the desert
shall also meet with the jackals, and the shaggy goat call to its companion.
The night creature shall also settle there, and shall find for herself a place
of rest. 
Isaiah
34:15  The arrow snake shall nest there,
and lay eggs and hatch, and gather them under her shadow. There too the
vultures shall gather, each with its mate. 
Isaiah
34:16  Search from the book of יהוה,
and read: not one of these shall be missing, not one shall be without a mate,
for He has commanded my mouth. And His Spirit shall gather them. 
Isaiah
34:17  And He shall cast the lot for
them, and His hand shall divide it among them with a measuring line – they
possess it forever, from generation to generation they dwell in it. 
Isaiah
35:1  Let the wilderness and the dry
place be glad for them, and let the desert rejoice, and blossom as the rose. 
Isaiah
35:2  It blossoms much and rejoices, even
with joy and singing. The esteem of Leḇanon shall be given to it, the
excellence of Karmel and Sharon. They shall see the esteem of יהוה,
the excellency of our Elohim.
Isaiah
35:3  Strengthen the weak hands, and make
firm the weak knees. 
Isaiah
35:4  Say to those with anxious heart, “Be
strong, do not fear! See, your Elohim comes with vengeance, with the recompense
of Elohim. He is coming to save you.” 
Isaiah
35:5  Then the eyes of the blind shall be
opened, and the ears of the deaf be opened. 
Isaiah
35:6  Then the lame shall leap like a
deer, and the tongue of the dumb sing, because waters shall burst forth in the
wilderness, and streams in the desert. 
Isaiah
35:7  And the parched ground shall become
a pool, and the thirsty land springs of water – in the home for jackals, where
each lay, grass with reeds and rushes. 
Isaiah
35:8  And there shall be a highway, and a
way, and it shall be called “The Way of Set-apartness.” The unclean does not
pass over it, but it is for those who walk the way, and no fools wander on it.
Isaiah
35:9  No lion is there, nor any ravenous
beast go up on it, it is not found there. But the redeemed shall walk there. 
Isaiah
35:10  And the ransomed of יהוה
shall return and enter Tsiyon with singing, with everlasting joy on their
heads. They shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee
away. 
Isaiah
36:1  And it came to be in the fourteenth
year of Sovereign Ḥizqiyahu that Sanḥĕriḇ sovereign of
Ashshur came up against all the walled cities of Yehuḏah and took them. 
Isaiah
36:2  And the sovereign of Ashshur sent
the Raḇshaqĕh with a great army from Laḵish to Sovereign Ḥizqiyahu
at Yerushalayim. And he stood by the channel of the upper pool, on the highway
to the Launderer’s Field. 
Isaiah
36:3  And there came to him Elyaqim son
of Ḥilqiyahu, who was over the household, and Sheḇnah the scribe,
and Yo’aḥ son of Asaph, the recorder. 
Isaiah
36:4  The Raḇshaqĕh then said
to them, “Please say to Ḥizqiyahu, ‘Thus said the great sovereign, the
sovereign of Ashshur, “What trust is this in which you trust? 
Isaiah
36:5  “I say: You speak of having counsel
and strength for battle, but they are vain words. Now in whom do you trust,
that you have rebelled against me? 
Isaiah
36:6  “Look! You are trusting in the
staff of this broken reed, Mitsrayim, on which if a man leans, it shall go into
his hand and pierce it. So is Pharaoh the sovereign of Mitsrayim to all who
trust in him. 
Isaiah
36:7  “But if you say to me, ‘We trust in
יהוה our Elohim,’ is it not He whose high places and
whose altars Ḥizqiyahu has taken away, and has said to Yehuḏah and
to Yerushalayim, ‘Bow yourselves before this altar’? 
Isaiah
36:8  “And now, I urge you, please give a
pledge to my master the sovereign of Ashshur, and I give you two thousand
horses, if you are able on your part to put riders on them! 
Isaiah
36:9  “And how do you refuse one officer
of the least of my master’s servants, and put your trust in Mitsrayim for
chariots and horsemen? 
Isaiah
36:10  “And now, have I come up without יהוה
against this land to destroy it? יהוה said to me, ‘Go
up against this land, and destroy it.’ ” 
Isaiah
36:11  And Elyaqim, Sheḇnah, and Yo’aḥ
said to the Raḇshaqĕh, “Please speak to your servants in Aramaic,
for we understand it. And do not speak to us in the language of Yehuḏah
in the hearing of the people who are on the wall.” 
Isaiah
36:12  But the Raḇshaqĕh said,
“Has my master sent me to your master and to you to speak these words, and not
to the men who sit on the wall, to eat their own dung and drink their own urine
with you?” 
Isaiah
36:13  And the Raḇshaqĕh stood
and called out with a loud voice in the language of Yehuḏah, and said, “Hear
the words of the great sovereign, the sovereign of Ashshur! 
Isaiah
36:14  “Thus said the sovereign, ‘Do not
let Ḥizqiyahu deceive you, for he is unable to deliver you, 
Isaiah
36:15  and do not let Ḥizqiyahu
make you trust in יהוה, saying, “ יהוה
shall certainly deliver us, this city is not given into the hand of the
sovereign of Ashshur.” ’ 
Isaiah
36:16  “Do not listen to Ḥizqiyahu,
for thus said the sovereign of Ashshur, ‘Make peace with me by a present and
come out to me. And let each of you eat from his own vine and each from his own
fig tree, and each of you drink the waters of his own cistern, 
Isaiah
36:17  until I come. Then I shall take
you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of
bread and vineyards. 
Isaiah
36:18  ‘Beware lest Ḥizqiyahu
mislead you, saying, “ יהוה shall deliver us.” Has any
one of the mighty ones of the nations delivered its land from the hand of the
sovereign of Ashshur? 
Isaiah
36:19  ‘Where are the mighty ones of Ḥamath
and Arpaḏ? Where are the mighty ones of Sepharwayim? And when have they
delivered Shomeron from my hand? 
Isaiah
36:20  ‘Who among all the mighty ones of
these lands have delivered their land from my hand, that יהוה
should deliver Yerushalayim from my hand?’ ” 
Isaiah
36:21  But they were silent and answered
him not a word, for the command of the sovereign was, “Do not answer him.” 
Isaiah
36:22  And Elyaqim son of Ḥilqiyahu,
who was over the household, Sheḇnah the scribe, and Yo’aḥ son of
Asaph, the recorder, came to Ḥizqiyahu with their garments torn, and they
reported to him the words of the Raḇshaqĕh. 
Isaiah
37:1  And it came to be, when Sovereign Ḥizqiyahu
heard it, that he tore his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and
went into the House of יהוה, 
Isaiah
37:2  and sent Elyaqim, who was over the
household, and Sheḇnah the scribe, and the elders of the priests,
covering themselves with sackcloth, to Yeshayahu the prophet, the son of Amots.

Isaiah
37:3  And they said to him, “Thus said Ḥizqiyahu,
‘This day is a day of distress and rebuke and scorn, for the children have come
to birth, but there is no strength to bring forth. 
Isaiah
37:4  ‘It could be that יהוה
your Elohim does hear the words of the Raḇshaqĕh, whom his master
the sovereign of Ashshur has sent to reproach the living Elohim, and shall
rebuke the words which יהוה your Elohim has heard.
Therefore lift up your prayer for the remnant that is left.’ ” 
Isaiah
37:5  So the servants of Sovereign Ḥizqiyahu
came to Yeshayahu, 
Isaiah
37:6  and Yeshayahu said to them, “Say
this to your master, ‘Thus said יהוה, “Do not be afraid
of the words which you have heard, with which the servants of the sovereign of
Ashshur have reviled Me. 
Isaiah
37:7  “See, I am putting a spirit in him,
and he shall hear a report and return to his own land. And I shall cause him to
fall by the sword in his own land.” ’ ” 
Isaiah
37:8  And the Raḇshaqĕh returned
and found the sovereign of Ashshur fighting against Liḇnah, for he had
heard that he had left Laḵish. 
Isaiah
37:9  And he heard concerning Tirhaqah
sovereign of Kush, “He has come out to fight with you.” And when he heard it,
he sent messengers to Ḥizqiyahu, saying, 
Isaiah
37:10  “Speak to Ḥizqiyahu the
sovereign of Yehuḏah, saying, ‘Do not let your Elohim in whom you trust
deceive you, saying, “Yerushalayim is not given into the hand of the sovereign
of Ashshur.” 
Isaiah
37:11  ‘See, you have heard what the
sovereigns of Ashshur have done to all lands by putting them under the ban. And
are you going to be delivered? 
Isaiah
37:12  ‘Have the mighty ones of the
nations delivered those whom my fathers have destroyed, Gozan and Ḥaran
and Retseph, and the sons of Ĕḏen who were in Telassar? 
Isaiah
37:13  ‘Where is the sovereign of Ḥamath,
and the sovereign of Arpaḏ, and the sovereign of the city of Sepharwayim,
Hĕna, and Iwwah?’ ” 
Isaiah
37:14  And Ḥizqiyahu received the
letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it. And Ḥizqiyahu went
up to the House of יהוה, and spread it before יהוה.

Isaiah
37:15  And Ḥizqiyahu prayed to יהוה,
saying, 
Isaiah
37:16  “O יהוה of
hosts, Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, the One who dwells between the keruḇim,
You are Elohim, You alone, of all the reigns of the earth. You have made the
heavens and earth. 
Isaiah
37:17  “Incline Your ear, O יהוה,
and hear. Open Your eyes, O יהוה, and see. And hear all
the words of Sanḥĕriḇ, who has sent to reproach the living
Elohim. 
Isaiah
37:18  “Truly, יהוה,
the sovereigns of Ashshur have laid waste all the lands, and their land, 
Isaiah
37:19  and have put their mighty ones
into the fire, for they were not mighty ones, but the work of men’s hands, wood
and stone. And they destroyed them. 
Isaiah
37:20  “And now, O יהוה
our Elohim, save us from his hand, so that all the reigns of the earth know
that You are יהוה, You alone.” 
Isaiah
37:21  Then Yeshayahu son of Amots sent
to Ḥizqiyahu, saying, “Thus said יהוה Elohim of
Yisra’ĕl, ‘Because you have prayed to Me against Sanḥĕriḇ
sovereign of Ashshur, 
Isaiah
37:22  this is the word which יהוה
has spoken concerning him, “The maiden, the daughter of Tsiyon, has despised
you, mocked you; the daughter of Yerushalayim has shaken her head behind you! 
Isaiah
37:23  “Whom have you reproached and
reviled? And against whom have you raised your voice, and lifted up your eyes
in pride? Against the Set-apart One of Yisra’ĕl! 
Isaiah
37:24  “By the hand of your servants you
have reproached יהוה, and said, ‘With my many chariots
I have come up to the height of the mountains, to the limits of Leḇanon.
And I cut down its tall cedars and its choice cypress trees. And I enter its
farthest height, its thickest forest. 
Isaiah
37:25  ‘I have dug and drunk water, and
with the soles of my feet I have dried up all the streams of defence.’ 
Isaiah
37:26  “Have you not heard long ago how I
made it, from days of old, that I formed it? Now I have brought it about, that
you should be for crushing walled cities into heaps of ruins. 
Isaiah
37:27  “And their inhabitants were
powerless, they were overthrown and put to shame. They were as the grass of the
field and as the green plant, as the grass on the house-tops and as grain
blighted before it is grown. 
Isaiah
37:28  “But I know your sitting down, and
your going out and your coming in, and your rage against Me. 
Isaiah
37:29  “Because your rage against Me and
your pride have come up to My ears, I shall put My hook in your nose and My
bridle in your lips, and I shall turn you back by the way which you came. 
Isaiah
37:30  “And this shall be the sign for
you: This year you eat such as grows of itself, and the second year what
springs from that, and in the third year sow and reap, plant vineyards, and eat
the fruit of them. 
Isaiah
37:31  “And the remnant who have escaped
of the house of Yehuḏah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit
upward. 
Isaiah
37:32  “For out of Yerushalayim comes
forth a remnant, and those who escape from Mount Tsiyon – the ardour of יהוה
of hosts does this.
Isaiah
37:33  “Therefore thus said יהוה
concerning the sovereign of Ashshur, ‘He does not come into this city, nor does
he shoot an arrow there, nor does he come before it with shield, nor does he
build a siege mound against it. 
Isaiah
37:34  ‘By the way that he came, by the
same he turns back. And into this city he does not come,’ declares יהוה.

Isaiah
37:35  ‘And I shall defend this city, to
save it for My own sake and for the sake of My servant Dawiḏ.’ ” 
Isaiah
37:36  And a messenger of יהוה
went out, and killed in the camp of Ashshur one hundred and eighty-five
thousand. And they arose early in the morning, and saw all of them, dead
bodies. 
Isaiah
37:37  And Sanḥĕriḇ the
sovereign of Ashshur broke camp and went away, and turned back, and remained at
Ninewĕh. 
Isaiah
37:38  And it came to be, as he was
bowing himself in the house of Nisroḵ his mighty one, that his sons Aḏrammeleḵ
and Shar’etser smote him with the sword, and they escaped into the land of
Ararat. And his son Ĕsarḥaddon reigned in his place. 
Isaiah
38:1  In those days Ḥizqiyahu was
sick and near death. And Yeshayahu the prophet, the son of Amots, came to him,
and said to him, “Thus said יהוה, ‘Set your house in
order, for you are going to die and not live.’ ” 
Isaiah
38:2  And Ḥizqiyahu turned his face
toward the wall, and prayed to יהוה, 
Isaiah
38:3  and said, “I pray, O יהוה,
please remember how I have walked before You in truth and with a perfect heart,
and have done what is good in Your eyes.” And Ḥizqiyahu wept bitterly. 
Isaiah
38:4  And the word of יהוה
came to Yeshayahu, saying, 
Isaiah
38:5  “Go and say to Ḥizqiyahu, ‘Thus
said יהוה, the Elohim of Dawiḏ your father, “I
have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears. See, I am adding fifteen years
to your days. 
Isaiah
38:6  “And out of the hand of the
sovereign of Ashshur I shall deliver you and this city, and protect this city.”
’ 
Isaiah
38:7  “And this is the sign to you from יהוה,
that יהוה does this word which He has spoken: 
Isaiah
38:8  “See, I am bringing the shadow on
the sundial, which has gone down with the sun on the sundial of Aḥaz, ten
degrees backward.” And the sun returned ten degrees on the dial by which it had
gone down. 
Isaiah
38:9  This is the writing of Ḥizqiyahu
sovereign of Yehuḏah, when he had been sick and had recovered from his
sickness: 
Isaiah
38:10  I said, “Am I to go into the gates
of the grave in the prime of my life? Shall I be deprived of the rest of my
years?” 
Isaiah
38:11  I said, “I shall not see Yah – Yah
in the land of the living! I shall no longer look on man with the inhabitants
of the world! 
Isaiah
38:12  “My dwelling is plucked up, taken
from me like a shepherd’s tent. I have cut off my life like a weaver; He cuts
me off from the loom. From day to night You make an end of me. 
Isaiah
38:13  “I soothed myself until morning.
Like a lion, so He shatters all my bones. From day to night You make an end of
me. 
Isaiah
38:14  “Like a swallow or a thrush, so I
chattered; I moaned like a dove; my eyes look weakly on high. O יהוה,
I am oppressed, undertake for me! 
Isaiah
38:15  “What do I say? For He has spoken
to me, and He Himself has acted. Softly I go, all my years, because of the
bitterness of my being. 
Isaiah
38:16  “O יהוה,
by these do men live, and my spirit
finds life in all of them. Restore me and make me live. 
Isaiah
38:17  “See, for peace I had what was
bitter, bitter. But You have lovingly delivered my being from the pit of
corruption, for You have cast all my sins behind Your back. 
Isaiah
38:18  “For the grave does not thank You,
nor death praise You; those who go down to the pit do not watch for Your truth.

Isaiah
38:19  “The living, the living – he is
praising You, as I do this day. A father makes known Your truth to his
children. 
Isaiah
38:20  “ יהוה, come to save me! And let us sing my
songs with stringed instruments all the days of our life in the House of יהוה.”

Isaiah
38:21  For Yeshayahu had said, “Let them
take a cake of figs, and apply it on the boil, so that he lives.” 
Isaiah
38:22  And Ḥizqiyahu asked, “What
is the sign that I go up to the House of יהוה ?” 
Isaiah
39:1  At that time Meroḏaḵ-Balaḏan
son of Balaḏan, sovereign of Baḇel, sent letters and a present to Ḥizqiyahu,
for he heard that he had been sick and had recovered. 
Isaiah
39:2  And Ḥizqiyahu was pleased
with them, and showed them the house of his treasures, the silver and gold, the
spices and precious ointment, and all his armoury, and all that was found among
his treasures. There was not an object in his house or in all his rule that Ḥizqiyahu
did not show them. 
Isaiah
39:3  And Yeshayahu the prophet went to
Sovereign Ḥizqiyahu, and said to him, “What did these men say, and from
where did they come to you?” And Ḥizqiyahu said, “They came to me from a
distant land, from Baḇel.” 
Isaiah
39:4  And he said, “What have they seen
in your house?” And Ḥizqiyahu said, “They have seen all that is in my
house; there is not an object among my treasures that I did not show them.” 
Isaiah
39:5  So Yeshayahu said to Ḥizqiyahu,
“Hear the word of יהוה of hosts: 
Isaiah
39:6  ‘See, the days are coming when all
that is in your house, and what your fathers have stored up until this day,
shall be taken away to Baḇel; not a matter shall be left,’ declares יהוה.

Isaiah
39:7  ‘And they shall take some of your
sons who are born to you, whom you bring forth. And they shall be eunuchs in
the palace of the sovereign of Baḇel.’ ” 
Isaiah
39:8  And Ḥizqiyahu said to
Yeshayahu, “The word of יהוה which you have spoken is good!”
And he said, “Because there is peace and truth in my days.” 
Isaiah
40:1  “Comfort, comfort My people!” says
your Elohim. 
Isaiah
40:2  “Speak to the heart of
Yerushalayim, and cry out to her, that her hard service is completed, that her
crookedness is pardoned, that she has received from the hand of יהוה
double for all her sins.” 
Isaiah
40:3  The voice of one crying in the
wilderness, “Prepare the way of יהוה ; make straight in
the desert a highway for our Elohim. 
Isaiah
40:4  “Let every valley be raised, and
every mountain and hill made low. And the steep ground shall become level, and
the rough places smooth. 
Isaiah
40:5  “And the esteem of יהוה
shall be revealed, and all flesh together shall see it. For the mouth of יהוה
has spoken.” 
Isaiah
40:6  The voice said, “Cry out!” and he
said, “What do I cry?” “All flesh is grass, and all its loveliness is like the
flower of the field. 
Isaiah
40:7  “Grass shall wither, the flower
shall fade, when the Spirit of יהוה has blown on it!
Truly the people is grass! 
Isaiah
40:8  “Grass shall wither, the flower
shall fade, but the Word of our Elohim stands forever.”
Isaiah
40:9  You who bring good news to Tsiyon,
get up into the high mountain. You who bring good news to Yerushalayim, lift up
your voice with strength, lift it up, be not afraid. Say to the cities of Yehuḏah,
“See your Elohim!” 
Isaiah
40:10  See, the Master יהוה
comes with a strong hand, and His arm rules for Him. See, His reward is with
Him, and His recompense before Him. 
Isaiah
40:11  He feeds His flock like a
shepherd, He gathers the lambs with His arm, and carries them in His bosom,
gently leading those who are with young. 
Isaiah
40:12  Who has measured the waters in the
hollow of his hand, and measured the heavens with a span, and contained the
dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales and the
hills in a balance?
Isaiah
40:13  Who has meted out the Spirit of יהוה,
or as His counsellor taught Him? 
Isaiah
40:14  With whom did He take counsel, and
who instructed Him, and taught Him in the path of right-ruling? Who taught Him
knowledge, and showed Him the way of understanding? 
Isaiah
40:15  See, nations are as a drop in a
bucket, and are reckoned as dust on the balance. See, He lifts up isles as fine
dust. 
Isaiah
40:16  And Leḇanon is not enough to
burn, nor its beasts enough for a burnt offering. 
Isaiah
40:17  All nations before Him are as a
non-entity, and they are reckoned by Him as less than a speck, and emptiness. 
Isaiah
40:18  And to whom would you liken Ĕl?
And what likeness would you compare to Him? 
Isaiah
40:19  The workman moulds a graven image,
and the goldsmith overspreads it with gold, and the silversmith casts silver
chains. 
Isaiah
40:20  He who is too poor for such an
offering chooses a tree that does not rot. He seeks for himself a skilled
craftsman to prepare a carved image that does not totter. 
Isaiah
40:21  Did you not know? Have you not
heard? Has it not been declared to you from the beginning? Have you not
understood from the foundations of the earth? 
Isaiah
40:22  It is He who sits above the circle
of the earth, and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers, who stretches out the
heavens like a curtain, and spreads them out like a tent to dwell in, 
Isaiah
40:23  who brings princes to naught, shall
make the rulers of the earth as emptiness. 
Isaiah
40:24  Hardly have they been planted,
hardly have they been sown, hardly has their stock taken root in the earth,
when He shall blow on them and they wither, and a whirlwind take them away like
stubble. 
Isaiah
40:25  “And to whom then do you liken Me,
or to whom am I compared?” says the
Set-apart One. 
Isaiah
40:26  Lift up your eyes on high and see.
Who has created these? He who is bringing out their host by number, He calls
them all by name, by the greatness of His might and the strength of His power –
not one is missing. 
Isaiah
40:27  Why do you say, O Ya‛aqoḇ,
and speak, O Yisra’ĕl, “My way is hidden from יהוה,
and my rights are overlooked by my Elohim”? 
Isaiah
40:28  Did you not know? Have you not
heard? The everlasting Elohim, יהוה, the Creator of the
ends of the earth, neither faints nor is weary. His understanding is
unsearchable. 
Isaiah
40:29  He gives power to the faint, and
to those who have no might He increases strength. 
Isaiah
40:30  Even youths shall faint and be
weary, and young men stumble and fall, 
Isaiah
40:31  but those who wait on יהוה
renew their strength, they raise up the wing like eagles, they run and are not
weary, they walk and do not faint. 
Isaiah
41:1  “Be silent before Me, you
coastlands, and let peoples renew their power! Let them come near, then let
them speak. Let us come together for right-ruling. 
Isaiah
41:2  “Who raised up the righteous one
from the east, called him to His foot, gave the nations before him, and made
sovereigns submit to him? He gave them as the dust to his sword, as driven
stubble to his bow. 
Isaiah
41:3  “He pursued them, passed over in
safety, by a path that he had not gone with his feet. 
Isaiah
41:4  “Who has performed and done it,
calling the generations from the beginning? ‘I, יהוה,
am the first, and with the last I am He.’ ” 
Isaiah
41:5  Coastlands see it and fear, the
ends of the earth are afraid – they draw near and come. 
Isaiah
41:6  Everyone helps his neighbour, and
says to his brother, “Be strong!” 
Isaiah
41:7  And the craftsman encourages the
goldsmith. He who smooths with the hammer inspires him who strikes the anvil,
saying of the joining, “It is good.” And he fastens it with nails, so it does
not totter. 
Isaiah
41:8  “But you, Yisra’ĕl, are My
servant, Ya‛aqoḇ, whom I have chosen, the descendants of Aḇraham
My friend, 
Isaiah
41:9  whom I have taken from the ends of
the earth, and called from its farthest parts, and said to You, ‘You are My
servant, I have chosen you and have not rejected you. 
Isaiah
41:10  ‘Do not fear, for I am with you.
Do not look around, for I am your Elohim. I shall strengthen you, I shall also
help you, I shall also uphold you with the right hand of My righteousness.’ 
Isaiah
41:11  “See, all those who raged against
you are ashamed and blush, they are as non-existent. And the men who strive
with you perish. 
Isaiah
41:12  “You seek them but do not find
them, those who struggle with you. Those who fight you are as non-existent, as
naught. 
Isaiah
41:13  “For I, יהוה
your Elohim, am holding your right hand, saying to you, ‘Do not fear, I shall
help you.’ 
Isaiah
41:14  “Do not fear, you worm Ya‛aqoḇ,
you men of Yisra’ĕl! I shall help you,” declares יהוה
and your Redeemer, the Set-apart One of Yisra’ĕl. 
Isaiah
41:15  “See, I shall make you into a new
threshing sledge with sharp teeth, let you thresh mountains and beat them
small, and make hills like chaff. 
Isaiah
41:16  “You winnow them, the wind lifts
them up, and the whirlwind scatters them; but you, you rejoice in יהוה,
and boast in the Set-apart One of Yisra’ĕl. 
Isaiah
41:17  “When the poor and needy seek
water, and there is none, and their tongues have failed for thirst, I, יהוה,
do answer them; I, the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, do not forsake them. 
Isaiah
41:18  “I open rivers on bare hills, and
fountains in the midst of valleys; I make a wilderness become a pool of water,
and a dry land springs of water. 
Isaiah
41:19  “I set in the wilderness cedar,
acacia and myrtle and oil tree; I place in the desert cypress, pine and box
tree together. 
Isaiah
41:20  “So that they see and know, and
consider and understand together, that the hand of יהוה
has done this, and the Set-apart One of Yisra’ĕl has created it. 
Isaiah
41:21  “Present your case,” says יהוה.
“Let your strong ones come near,”
says the Sovereign of Ya‛aqoḇ. 
Isaiah
41:22  “Let them draw near and declare to
us what is going to take place; let them declare the former events, what they were, and we consider
them, and know the latter end of them; or announce to us what is coming. 
Isaiah
41:23  “Declare the events that are going to come hereafter, and we know that you are
mighty ones; yea, do good or do evil, and let us be amazed and see it together.

Isaiah
41:24  “See, you are of naught, and your
work a breath; he who chooses you is an abomination. 
Isaiah
41:25  “I have stirred up one from the
north, and he comes; from the rising of the sun he calls on My Name. And he
comes against princes as though mortar, as the potter treads clay. 
Isaiah
41:26  “Who has declared from the
beginning, and we know? and former times, and we say, ‘He is righteous’? No, no
one is declaring; no, no one is proclaiming; no, no one is hearing your words. 
Isaiah
41:27  “He who is First said to Tsiyon, ‘See, see them!’ And to
Yerushalayim I give one who brings good news. 
Isaiah
41:28  “And I see that there is no man,
and of these, there is no counsellor, who, when I ask of them, answers a word. 
Isaiah
41:29  “See, all of them are useless,
their works are naught, their moulded images are wind and confusion. 
Isaiah
42:1  “See, My Servant whom I uphold, My
Chosen One My being has delighted in! I have put My Spirit upon Him; He brings
forth right-ruling to the nations. 
Isaiah
42:2  “He does not cry out, nor lifts up His voice, nor causes His voice to be
heard in the street. 
Isaiah
42:3  “A crushed reed He does not break,
and smoking flax He does not quench. He brings forth right-ruling in accordance
with truth. 
Isaiah
42:4  “He does not become weak or
crushed, until He has established right-ruling in the earth. And the coastlands
wait for His Torah.” 
Isaiah
42:5  Thus said the Ĕl, יהוה,
who created the heavens and stretched them out, who spread forth the earth and
that which comes from it, who gives breath to the people on it, and spirit to
those who walk on it: 
Isaiah
42:6  “I, יהוה,
have called You in righteousness, and I take hold of Your hand and guard You,
and give You for a covenant to a people, for a light to the gentiles, 
Isaiah
42:7  to open blind eyes, to bring out
prisoners from the prison, those who sit in darkness from the prison house. 
Isaiah
42:8  “I am יהוה,
that is My Name, and My esteem I do not give to another, nor My praise to
idols. 
Isaiah
42:9  “See, the former predictions have come, and new ones I am
declaring; before they spring forth I let you hear them.” 
Isaiah
42:10  Sing to יהוה
a new song; His praise from the ends of the earth, you who go down to the sea,
and all that is in it, you coastlands and you inhabitants of them! 
Isaiah
42:11  Let the wilderness and its cities
lift up their voice, the villages where Qĕḏar dwells. Let the
inhabitants of Sela sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains. 
Isaiah
42:12  Let them give esteem to יהוה,
and declare His praise in the coastlands. 
Isaiah
42:13  יהוה goes
forth like a mighty man. He stirs up ardour like a fighter. He cries out, yea,
shout aloud. Over His enemies He shows Himself mighty. 
Isaiah
42:14  “I have kept silent from of old, I
have been still and held Myself back. Like a woman in labour I now cry out, I pant and gasp at once. 
Isaiah
42:15  “I lay waste mountains and hills,
and I dry up all their plants. And I shall make rivers become coastlands, and I
dry up pools. 
Isaiah
42:16  “And I shall lead the blind by a
way they have not known – in paths they have not known I lead them. I make
darkness light before them, and crooked places straight. These matters I shall
do for them, and I shall not forsake them. 
Isaiah
42:17  “Those who trust in idols, who say
to the moulded images, ‘You are our mighty ones,’ shall be turned back, utterly
ashamed. 
Isaiah
42:18  “Hear, you deaf! And look, you
blind, and see. 
Isaiah
42:19  “Who is blind but My servant, or
deaf as My messenger whom I send? Who is blind as he who is at peace, and blind
as servant of יהוה ? 
Isaiah
42:20  “You see much, but do not observe;
ears are open, but do not hear.” 
Isaiah
42:21  It has delighted יהוה,
for the sake of His righteousness, to make the Torah great and esteemed. 
Isaiah
42:22  But this is a people robbed and
plundered, all of them are snared in holes, and they are hidden in prison
houses. They have become a prey, with no one to deliver – for plunder, and no
one to say, “Restore!” 
Isaiah
42:23  Who among you gives ear to this,
pays attention and hears for the time to come? 
Isaiah
42:24  Who gave Ya‛aqoḇ for
plunder, and Yisra’ĕl to the robbers? Was it not יהוה,
He against whom we sinned? For they would not walk in His ways, and they did
not obey His Torah! 
Isaiah
42:25  So He has poured on him His
burning displeasure and the strength of battle, and it set him on fire all
around, yet he did not understand. And it burned against him, yet he did not
take it to heart!
Isaiah
43:1  But now, thus said יהוה,
your Creator, O Ya‛aqoḇ, and He who formed you, O Yisra’ĕl, “Do
not fear, for I have redeemed you. I have called you by your name, you are
Mine. 
Isaiah
43:2  “When you pass through the waters,
I am with you; and through rivers, they do not overflow you. When you walk
through fire, you are not scorched, and a flame does not burn you. 
Isaiah
43:3  “For I am יהוה
your Elohim, the Set-apart One of Yisra’ĕl, your Saviour; I gave Mitsrayim
for your ransom, Kush and Seḇa in your place. 
Isaiah
43:4  “Since you were precious in My
eyes, you have been esteemed, and I have loved you. And I give men in your
place, and peoples for your life. 
Isaiah
43:5  “Do not fear, for I am with you. I
shall bring your seed from the east, and gather you from the west. 
Isaiah
43:6  “I shall say to the north, ‘Give
them up!’ And to the south, ‘Do not keep them back!’ Bring My sons from afar,
and My daughters from the ends of the earth – 
Isaiah
43:7  all those who are called by My
Name, whom I have created, formed, even made for My esteem.” 
Isaiah
43:8  He shall bring out a blind people
who have eyes, and deaf ones who have ears. 
Isaiah
43:9  All the nations shall be assembled,
and the peoples be gathered. Who among them declares this, and show us former events? Let them give their witnesses,
to be declared right; or let them hear and say, “It is truth.”
Isaiah
43:10  “You are My witnesses,” declares יהוה,
“And My servant whom I have chosen, so that you know and believe Me, and
understand that I am He. Before Me there was no Ĕl formed, nor after Me
there is none. 
Isaiah
43:11  “I, I am יהוה,
and besides Me there is no saviour. 
Isaiah
43:12  “I, I have declared and saved, and
made known, and there was no foreign mighty one among you. And you are My
witnesses,” declares יהוה, “that I am Ĕl. 
Isaiah
43:13  “Even from the day I am He, and no
one delivers out of My hand. I work, and who turns it back?” 
Isaiah
43:14  Thus said יהוה,
your Redeemer, the Set-apart One of Yisra’ĕl, “For your sake I shall send
to Baḇel, and bring them all down as fugitives, even the Chaldeans, who
rejoice in their ships. 
Isaiah
43:15  “I am יהוה,
your Set-apart One, Creator of Yisra’ĕl, your Sovereign.” 
Isaiah
43:16  Thus said יהוה,
who makes a way in the sea and a path through the mighty waters, 
Isaiah
43:17  who brings forth the chariot and
horse, the army and the power (they lie down together, they do not rise, they
have been extinguished, they have been quenched like a wick): 
Isaiah
43:18  “Do not remember the former events, nor consider the events of old. 
Isaiah
43:19  “See, I am doing what is new, let
it now spring forth. Do you not know it? I am even making a way in the
wilderness and rivers in the desert. 
Isaiah
43:20  “The beast of the field esteems
Me, the jackals and the ostriches, because I have given waters in the wilderness
and rivers in the desert, to give drink to My people, My chosen,
Isaiah
43:21  this people I have formed for
Myself, let them relate My praise. 
Isaiah
43:22  “But you have not called on Me, O
Ya‛aqoḇ, for you have been weary of Me, O Yisra’ĕl. 
Isaiah
43:23  “You have not brought Me the sheep
for your burnt offerings, nor have you esteemed Me with your slaughterings. I
have not caused you to serve with grain offerings, nor wearied you with
incense. 
Isaiah
43:24  “You have not bought Me sweet cane
with silver, nor have you satisfied Me with the fat of your slaughterings. You
have only burdened Me with your sins, you have wearied Me with your
crookednesses. 
Isaiah
43:25  “I, I am He who blots out your
transgressions for My own sake, and remember your sins no more. 
Isaiah
43:26  “Remind Me, let us enter into
judgment, together; relate, that you might be declared right. 
Isaiah
43:27  “Your first father sinned, and
your interpreters have transgressed against Me. 
Isaiah
43:28  “So I have profaned the chief ones
of the set-apart place, and I have delivered up Ya‛aqoḇ to the
curse, and Yisra’ĕl to scorn. 
Isaiah
44:1  “But now hear, O Ya‛aqoḇ
My servant, and Yisra’ĕl whom I have chosen. 
Isaiah
44:2  Thus said יהוה
who made you and formed you from the womb, who helps you, ‘Do not fear, O Ya‛aqoḇ
My servant, and Yeshurun, whom I have chosen.
Isaiah
44:3  ‘For I pour water on the thirsty,
and floods on the dry ground. I pour My Spirit on your seed, and My blessing on
your offspring, 
Isaiah
44:4  and they shall spring up among the
grass like willows by streams of water.’ 
Isaiah
44:5  “One says, ‘I belong to יהוה
; another calls himself by the name of Ya‛aqoḇ; another writes with
his hand, ‘Unto יהוה,’ and names himself by the name of
Yisra’ĕl. 
Isaiah
44:6  “Thus said יהוה,
Sovereign of Yisra’ĕl, and his Redeemer, יהוה of
hosts, ‘I am the First and I am the Last, besides Me there is no Elohim.
Isaiah
44:7  ‘And who is like Me? Let him call
and declare it, and lay it before Me, since I appointed the everlasting people.
And the events that are coming and those that do come, let them declare these
to them. 
Isaiah
44:8  ‘Do not fear, nor be afraid. Have I
not since made you hear, and declared it? You are My witnesses. Is there an
Eloah besides Me? There is no other Rock, I know not one.’ ” 
Isaiah
44:9  Those who make an idol, all of them
are emptiness, and their delights do not profit. And they are their own
witnesses; they neither see nor know, so that they are put to shame. 
Isaiah
44:10  Who would form a mighty one or
cast an idol that is of no value? 
Isaiah
44:11  See, all his companions are
ashamed, and the workmen, they are but men. Let them all be gathered together,
let them stand up, let them fear, let them be put to shame, altogether. 
Isaiah
44:12  The craftsman in iron with the
tools works one in the coals, and fashions it with hammers, and works it with
the strength of his arms. Even so, he shall be hungry, and has no strength; he
drinks no water and is weary. 
Isaiah
44:13  The carpenter stretches out his
rule, he outlines it with chalk; he fashions it with a plane, and he outlines
it with the compass, and makes it like the figure of a man, according to the
comeliness of a man, to remain in the house. 
Isaiah
44:14  He cuts down cedars for himself,
and takes cypress and oak, which he raised among the trees of the forest. He
has planted a pine, and the rain nourishes it. 
Isaiah
44:15  And it shall be for a man to burn,
for he takes some of it and warms himself. He also kindles it and shall bake
bread. He also makes a mighty one and bows himself to it – has made it a carved
image and falls down before it. 
Isaiah
44:16  Half of it he shall burn in the
fire; with this half he eats meat. He roasts a roast, and is satisfied. He also
warms himself and says, “Aha, I am warm, I have seen the fire.” 
Isaiah
44:17  And the rest of it he makes into a
mighty one, his carved image. He falls down before it and worships, prays to it
and says, “Deliver me, for you are my mighty one.” 
Isaiah
44:18  They do not know nor understand,
for He has smeared their eyes from seeing, and their hearts from understanding.

Isaiah
44:19  And no one recalls it to his
heart, nor is there knowledge nor understanding to say, “I have burned half of
it in the fire, and I have also baked bread on its coals; I have roasted meat
and eaten it. And shall I make the rest of it an abomination? Should I fall
down before a log of wood?” 
Isaiah
44:20  Feeding on ashes, a deceived heart
turns him aside, and he does not deliver his being, nor says, “Is there not a
lie in my right hand?” 
Isaiah
44:21  “Remember these matters, O Ya‛aqoḇ, and
Yisra’ĕl, for you are My servant! I have formed you, you are My servant, O
Yisra’ĕl, do not forget Me! 
Isaiah
44:22  “I shall wipe out your
transgressions like a cloud, and your sins like a mist. Return to Me, for I
shall redeem you.” 
Isaiah
44:23  Sing, O heavens, for יהוה
shall do it! Shout, O depths of the earth! Break forth into singing, O
mountains, forest, and every tree in it! For יהוה shall
redeem Ya‛aqoḇ, and make Himself clear in Yisra’ĕl. 
Isaiah
44:24  Thus said יהוה,
your Redeemer, and He who formed you from the womb, “I am יהוה,
doing all, stretching out the heavens all alone, spreading out the earth, with
none beside Me, 
Isaiah
44:25  frustrating the signs of the
babblers, and driving diviners mad, turning wise men backward, and making their
knowledge foolish, 
Isaiah
44:26  confirming the word of His
servant, and completing the counsel of His messengers, who says of Yerushalayim,
‘Be inhabited,’ and of the cities of Yehuḏah, ‘They shall be built, and
her ruins raised up by Me,’ 
Isaiah
44:27  who is saying to the deep, ‘Be
dry, and your rivers I dry up,’ 
Isaiah
44:28  who is saying of Koresh, ‘He is My
shepherd, and he completes all My pleasure, even saying to Yerushalayim, “Let
her be built,” and to the Hĕḵal, “Let her foundation be laid.” ’ 
Isaiah
45:1  “Thus said יהוה
to His anointed, to Koresh, whose right hand I have grasped, to subdue nations
before him and ungird the loins of sovereigns, to open before him the double
doors, so that gates are not shut: 
Isaiah
45:2  ‘I go before you and make the
crooked places straight; I shatter the gates of bronze and cut down the bars of
iron. 
Isaiah
45:3  ‘And I shall give you the treasures
of darkness and hoarded wealth of secret places, so that you know that I, יהוה,
who are calling you by your name, am the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl. 
Isaiah
45:4  ‘For the sake of Ya‛aqoḇ
My servant, and of Yisra’ĕl My chosen, I also call you by your name, I
give you a title, though you have not known Me. 
Isaiah
45:5  ‘I am יהוה,
and there is none else – there is no Elohim besides Me. I gird you, though you
have not known Me, 
Isaiah
45:6  so that they know from the rising
of the sun to its setting that there is none but Me. I am יהוה,
and there is none else, 
Isaiah
45:7  forming light and creating
darkness, making peace and creating evil. I, יהוה, do
all these.’ 
Isaiah
45:8  “Rain down, O heavens, from above,
and let clouds pour down righteousness. Let the earth open, let them bring
forth deliverance, and let righteousness spring up together. I, יהוה,
have created it. 
Isaiah
45:9  “Woe to him who strives with his
Maker! (a potsherd with the potsherds of the earth). Does clay say to him who
forms it, ‘What are you making?’ Or your handiwork say, ‘He has no hands’? 
Isaiah
45:10  “Woe to him who says to his
father, ‘What are you bringing forth?’ Or to the woman, ‘What are you labouring
over?’ ” 
Isaiah
45:11  Thus said יהוה,
the Set-apart One of Yisra’ĕl, and his Maker, “Do you ask Me about My sons
what is to come? And about the work of My hands do you command Me? 
Isaiah
45:12  “I have made the earth, and
created man on it. I, My hands have stretched out the heavens, and all their
host I have commanded. 
Isaiah
45:13  “I have stirred him up in
righteousness, and all his ways I make straight. He builds My city and lets My
exiles go, not for price nor reward,” declares יהוה of
hosts. 
Isaiah
45:14  Thus said יהוה,
“The labour of Mitsrayim and merchandise of Kush and of the Seḇaites, men
of size, come over to you and they are yours. They walk behind you, they come
over in chains, and they bow down to you. They make supplication to you,
saying, ‘Indeed, Ĕl is in you, and there is none else, no mighty one.’ ” 
Isaiah
45:15  Truly You are Ĕl, who hide
Yourself, O Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, Saviour! 
Isaiah
45:16  They shall be put to shame, and
even be humiliated, all of them – the makers of idols shall go away together in
humiliation. 
Isaiah
45:17  Yisra’ĕl shall be saved by יהוה
with an everlasting deliverance. You are not to be ashamed nor hurt, forever
and ever. 
Isaiah
45:18  For thus said יהוה,
Creator of the heavens, He is Elohim, Former of earth and its Maker, He
established it, He did not create it to be empty, He formed it to be inhabited:
“I am יהוה, and there is none else. 
Isaiah
45:19  “I have not spoken in secret, in a
dark place of the earth. I have not said to the seed of Ya‛aqoḇ, ‘Seek
Me in vain.’ I am יהוה, speaking righteousness,
declaring matters that are straight. 
Isaiah
45:20  “Gather yourselves and come; draw
near together, you who have escaped from the gentiles. No knowledge have they
who are lifting up the wood of their carved image, and pray to a mighty one
that does not save. 
Isaiah
45:21  “Declare and bring near, let them
even take counsel together. Who has announced this from of old? Who has
declared it from that time? Is it not I, יהוה ? And
there is no mighty one besides Me, a righteous Ĕl and a Saviour, there is
none besides Me. 
Isaiah
45:22  “Turn to Me and be saved, all you
ends of the earth! For I am Ĕl, and there is none else. 
Isaiah
45:23  “I have sworn by Myself, a word
has gone out of My mouth in righteousness, and shall not return, so that to Me
every knee shall bow, every tongue swear. 
Isaiah
45:24  “One shall say, ‘Only in יהוה
do I have righteousness and strength’ – he comes to Him. And all those
displeased with Him shall be put to shame. 
Isaiah
45:25  “In יהוה
all the seed of Yisra’ĕl shall be declared right and boast. ” 
Isaiah
46:1  Bĕl has bowed down, Neḇo
is stooping, their idols were on the beasts and on the cattle. That which is
carried is burdensome, a burden to the weary. 
Isaiah
46:2  They have stooped, they have bowed
down together, they were unable to deliver the burden, but they themselves went
into captivity. 
Isaiah
46:3  “Listen to Me, O house of Ya‛aqoḇ,
and all the remnant of the house of Yisra’ĕl, who are borne from the
belly, who are carried from the womb: 
Isaiah
46:4  even to your old age, I am He, and
even to grey hairs I carry! I have made and I bear, and I carry and rescue. 
Isaiah
46:5  “To whom do you liken Me, and
compare Me and make Me similar, that we should be alike? 
Isaiah
46:6  “They pour gold out of the bag, and
weigh silver on the scale. They hire a goldsmith, and he makes it a mighty one.
They fall down, they also bow themselves. 
Isaiah
46:7  “They bear it on the shoulder, they
carry it and set it in its place, and it stands – from its place it does not
move. Though one cries out to it, it does not answer, nor save him from his
distress. 
Isaiah
46:8  “Remember this, and show yourselves
men; turn it back, you transgressors. 
Isaiah
46:9  “Remember the former events of old, for I am Ĕl, and
there is no one else – Elohim, and there is no one like Me, 
Isaiah
46:10  declaring the end from the
beginning, and from of old that which has not yet been done, saying, ‘My counsel does stand, and all My delight I
do,’ 
Isaiah
46:11  calling a bird of prey from the
east, the man who executes My counsel, from a distant land. Indeed I have
spoken it, I also bring it to pass. I have planned it, I also do it. 
Isaiah
46:12  “Listen to Me, you
stubborn-hearted, who are far from righteousness: 
Isaiah
46:13  “I shall bring My righteousness
near, it is not far off, and My deliverance, it is not delayed. And I shall
give deliverance in Tsiyon, My esteem to Yisra’ĕl. 
Isaiah
47:1  “Come down and sit in the dust, O
maiden daughter of Baḇel. Sit on the ground without a throne, O daughter
of the Chaldeans! For no more do they call you tender and delicate. 
Isaiah
47:2  “Take the millstones and grind
flour. Remove your veil, lift up the skirt, uncover the leg, pass through
rivers. 
Isaiah
47:3  “Let your nakedness be uncovered,
let your shame also be exposed. I take vengeance, and meet no man.” 
Isaiah
47:4  Our Redeemer, יהוה
of hosts is His Name, the Set-apart One of Yisra’ĕl. 
Isaiah
47:5  “Sit silent, and go into darkness,
O daughter of the Chaldeans! For no more do they call you Mistress of Reigns. 
Isaiah
47:6  “I was wroth with My people, I have
profaned My inheritance and I gave them into your hand. You showed them no
compassion, you made your yoke very heavy on the elderly. 
Isaiah
47:7  “And you said, ‘I am mistress
forever,’ so that you did not take these matters
to heart, and did not remember the latter end of them. 
Isaiah
47:8  “And now, hear this, you who are
given to pleasures, who dwells complacently, who says in your heart, ‘I am, and
there is none but me. I do not sit as a widow, nor do I know the loss of
children.’ 
Isaiah
47:9  “Both of these come to you
suddenly, in one day: the loss of children, and widowhood. They shall come upon
you in completeness, because of your many witchcrafts, for your numerous great
potent spells. 
Isaiah
47:10  “And you have trusted in your
evil, you have said, ‘No one sees me.’ Your wisdom and your knowledge have led
you astray. And you have said in your heart, ‘I am, and there is none but me.’ 
Isaiah
47:11  “But evil shall come upon you, you
not knowing from where it arises, and trouble fall upon you, you being unable
to put it off, and ruin come upon you suddenly, which you know not. 
Isaiah
47:12  “Stand now with your potent spells
and your many witchcrafts, in which you have laboured from your youth, if so be
you are able to profit, if so be you find strength. 
Isaiah
47:13  “You are exhausted by your many
counsels; let the astrologers, the stargazers, and those who prognosticate by
the new moons stand up and save you from what is coming upon you. 
Isaiah
47:14  “See, they shall be as stubble,
fire shall burn them, they do not deliver themselves from the power of the
flame, there is not a coal to be warmed by, nor a fire to sit before it! 
Isaiah
47:15  “So they shall be to you with whom
you have laboured, your merchants from your youth. They shall wander, each one
his own way, there is none to save you. 
Isaiah
48:1  “Hear this, O house of Ya‛aqoḇ,
who are called by the name of Yisra’ĕl, and have come from the waters of
Yehuḏah, who swear by the Name of יהוה, and
profess the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl – though
not in truth or in righteousness – 
Isaiah
48:2  for they call themselves after the
set-apart city, and lean on the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl – יהוה
of hosts is His Name: 
Isaiah
48:3  “I have declared the former events from the beginning, and they went
forth from My mouth, and I made you hear them. Suddenly I acted, and they came
to be. 
Isaiah
48:4  “Because I knew that you were hard,
and your neck was an iron sinew, and your forehead bronze, 
Isaiah
48:5  therefore I declared it to you long
ago. Before it came I made you hear, lest you should say, ‘My idol has done
them, and my carved image and my moulded image commanded them.’ 
Isaiah
48:6  “You have heard, look at them all.
And do you not declare it? From now on I shall make you hear new ones, even
hidden ones, which you have not known. 
Isaiah
48:7  “Now they shall be created and not
long ago. And before this day you have not heard them, lest you should say, ‘Look,
I knew them.’ 
Isaiah
48:8  “No, you have not heard; no, you
have not known; no, from of old your ear has not been open. Because I knew that
you are indeed treacherous, and are called ‘a transgressor from the womb.’ 
Isaiah
48:9  “For My Name’s sake I postponed My
displeasure, and for My praise I held it back from you, so as not to cut you
off. 
Isaiah
48:10  “See, I have refined you, but not
as silver; I have chosen you in the furnace of affliction. 
Isaiah
48:11  “For My own sake, for My own sake,
I do it. For how is it profaned? And My esteem I do not give to another. 
Isaiah
48:12  “Listen to Me, O Ya‛aqoḇ,
and Yisra’ĕl, My called: I am He, I am the First, I am also the Last. 
Isaiah
48:13  “Also, My hand has laid the
foundation of the earth, and My right hand has stretched out the heavens. I
call to them, let them stand together. 
Isaiah
48:14  “All of you, gather yourselves,
and hear! Who among them has declared these? יהוה has
loved him. Let him do His pleasure on Baḇel, and His arm be on the
Chaldeans. 
Isaiah
48:15  “I, I have spoken, I have also called
him, I have brought him, and he shall make his way prosperous. 
Isaiah
48:16  “Come near to Me, hear this: I
have not spoken in secret from the beginning; from the time that it was, I was
there. And now the Master יהוה has sent Me, and His
Spirit.” 
Isaiah
48:17  Thus said יהוה,
your Redeemer, the Set-apart One of Yisra’ĕl, “I am יהוה
your Elohim, teaching you what is best, leading you by the way you should go. 
Isaiah
48:18  “If only you had listened to My
commands! Then your peace would have been like a river, and your righteousness
like the waves of the sea. 
Isaiah
48:19  “And your seed would have been
like the sand, and the offspring of your inward parts like the grains of sand.
His name would not have been cut off nor destroyed from before Me. 
Isaiah
48:20  “Come out of Baḇel! Flee
from the Chaldeans! Declare this with a voice of singing, proclaim it, send it
out to the end of the earth! Say, ‘ יהוה has redeemed
His servant Ya‛aqoḇ!’ ” 
Isaiah
48:21  And they did not thirst when He
led them through the deserts; He caused waters from a rock to flow for them; He
split the rock, and waters gushed out. 
Isaiah
48:22  “There is no peace for the wrong,”
said יהוה.” 
Isaiah
49:1  Listen to Me, O coastlands, and
hear, you peoples from afar! יהוה has called Me from
the womb, from My mother’s belly He has caused My Name to be remembered. 
Isaiah
49:2  And He made My mouth like a sharp
sword, in the shadow of His hand He hid Me, and made Me a polished shaft. In
His quiver He hid Me.” 
Isaiah
49:3  And He said to Me, ‘You are My
servant, O Yisra’ĕl, in whom I am adorned.’ 
Isaiah
49:4  And I said, ‘I have laboured in
vain, I have spent my strength for emptiness, and in vain. But my right-ruling
is with יהוה, and my work with my Elohim.’ ” 
Isaiah
49:5  And now said יהוה
– who formed Me from the womb to be His Servant, to bring Ya‛aqoḇ
back to Him, though Yisra’ĕl is not gathered to Him, yet I am esteemed in
the eyes of יהוה, and My Elohim has been My strength – 
Isaiah
49:6  and He says, “Shall it be a small matter for You to be My Servant to raise
up the tribes of Ya‛aqoḇ, and to bring back the preserved ones of
Yisra’ĕl? And I shall give You as a light to the gentiles, to be My
deliverance to the ends of the earth!” 
Isaiah
49:7  Thus said יהוה,
the Redeemer of Yisra’ĕl, their Set-apart One, to the despised , to the
loathed One of the nation, to the Servant of rulers, “Sovereigns shall see and
arise, rulers also shall bow themselves, because of יהוה
who is steadfast, the Set-apart One of Yisra’ĕl. And He has chosen You!” 
Isaiah
49:8  Thus said יהוה,
“In a favourable time I shall answer You, and in the day of deliverance I shall
help You – and I guard You and give You for a covenant of the people, to
restore the earth, to cause them to inherit the ruined inheritances, 
Isaiah
49:9  to say to the prisoners, ‘Go out,’
to those who are in darkness, ‘Show yourselves.’ “Let them feed on the ways,
and let their pasture be on all bare hills. 
Isaiah
49:10  “They shall not hunger nor thirst,
neither heat or sun strike them, for He who has compassion on them shall lead
them, even by fountains of water guide them. 
Isaiah
49:11  “And I shall make all My mountains
a way, and My highways raised up. 
Isaiah
49:12  “See, these come from far away,
and see, those from the north and the west, and these from the land of Sinim.” 
Isaiah
49:13  Sing, O heavens, rejoice, O earth!
And break out in singing, O mountains! For יהוה shall
comfort His people and have compassion on His afflicted ones. 
Isaiah
49:14  But Tsiyon says, “ יהוה
has forsaken me, and יהוה has forgotten me.” 
Isaiah
49:15  “Would a woman forget her nursing
child, and not have compassion on the son of her womb? Though they forget, I
never forget you. 
Isaiah
49:16  “See, I have inscribed you on the
palms of My hands; your walls are always before Me. 
Isaiah
49:17  “Your sons shall hurry, your
destroyers and those who laid you waste depart from you. 
Isaiah
49:18  “Lift up your eyes round about and
see, all of them gather together and come to you. As I live,” declares יהוה,
“you shall put on all of them as an ornament, and bind them on you as a bride
does. 
Isaiah
49:19  “For your wastes, and your
deserted places, and the land of your destruction, shall soon be too narrow for
the inhabitants, while those who swallowed you up are far away. 
Isaiah
49:20  “The sons of your bereavement
shall yet say in your ears, ‘The place is too narrow for me, make room for me
to live.’ 
Isaiah
49:21  “And you shall say in your heart, ‘Who
has brought forth these for me, since I am bereaved and barren, an exile, and
wandering to and fro? And who reared them? See, I was left alone – from where
did these come?’ ” 
Isaiah
49:22  Thus said the Master יהוה,
“See, I lift My hand up to the gentiles, and set up My banner for the peoples;
and they shall bring your sons in their arms, and your daughters carried on
their shoulders; 
Isaiah
49:23  “And sovereigns shall be your
foster fathers, and their sovereignesses your nursing mothers. They bow down to
you with their faces to the earth, and lick up the dust of your feet. And you
shall know that I am יהוה – those who wait for Me shall
not be ashamed.” 
Isaiah
49:24  Is prey taken from the mighty, and
the captives of the righteous delivered? 
Isaiah
49:25  Yet thus said יהוה,
“Even the captives of the mighty is taken away, and the prey of the ruthless is
delivered; and I strive with him who strives with you, and I save your
children. 
Isaiah
49:26  “And I shall feed those who
oppress you with their own flesh, and let them drink their own blood as sweet
wine. All flesh shall know that I, יהוה, am your
Saviour, and your Redeemer, the Elohim of Ya‛aqoḇ.” 
Isaiah
50:1  Thus says יהוה,
“Where is the certificate of your mother’s divorce, whom I have put away? Or
which of My creditors is it to whom I have sold you? Look, you were sold for
your crookednesses, and your mother was put away for your transgressions. 
Isaiah
50:2  “When I came, why was there no one?
When I called, why was there no one to answer? Was My hand too short to redeem?
Or have I no power to deliver? See, by My rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the
rivers a wilderness; their fish stink for there is not water, and die of
thirst. 
Isaiah
50:3  “I clothe the heavens with
darkness, and I make sackcloth their covering.” 
Isaiah
50:4  The Master יהוה
has given Me the tongue of taught ones, that I should know to help the weary
with a word. He wakes Me morning by morning, he wakes My ear to hear as taught
ones. 
Isaiah
50:5  The Master יהוה
has opened My ear, and I was not rebellious, nor did I turn away.
Isaiah
50:6  I gave My back to those who struck
Me, and My cheeks to those who plucked out the beard, I did not hide My face
from humiliation and spitting. 
Isaiah
50:7  And the Master יהוה
helps Me, therefore I shall not be humiliated. So I have set My face like a
flint, and I know that I am not put to shame. 
Isaiah
50:8  Near is He who declares Me right.
Who would contend with Me? Let us stand together. Who is My adversary? Let him
come near Me. 
Isaiah
50:9  See, the Master יהוה
helps Me. Who would declare Me wrong? See, all of them wear out like a garment,
a moth eats them. 
Isaiah
50:10  Who among you is fearing יהוה,
obeying the voice of His Servant, that has walked in darkness and has no light?
Let him trust in the Name of יהוה and lean upon his
Elohim! 
Isaiah
50:11  See, all you who light a fire,
girding on burning arrows: walk in the light of your fire and in the burning
arrows you have lit. From My hand you shall have this: you shall lie down in
grief! 
Isaiah
51:1  “Listen to Me, you who pursue
righteousness, seeking יהוה : Look to the rock you were
hewn from, and to the hole of the pit you were dug from. 
Isaiah
51:2  “Look to Aḇraham your father,
and to Sarah who bore you. For he was alone when I called him, and I blessed
him and increased him. 
Isaiah
51:3  “For יהוה
shall comfort Tsiyon, He shall comfort all her waste places. For He makes her
wilderness like Ĕḏen, and her desert like the garden of יהוה.
Joy and gladness are found in it, thanksgiving and the voice of song. 
Isaiah
51:4  “Listen to Me, My people, and give
ear to Me, O My nation, for the Torah goes forth from Me, and My right-ruling I
set as a light to peoples. 
Isaiah
51:5  “My righteousness is near, My
deliverance shall go forth, and My arms judge peoples. Coastlands wait upon Me,
and for My arm they wait expectantly. 
Isaiah
51:6  “Lift up your eyes to the heavens,
and look on the earth beneath, for the heavens shall vanish like smoke, and the
earth wear out like a garment, and those who dwell in it die as gnats. But My
deliverance is forever, and My righteousness is not broken. 
Isaiah
51:7  “Listen to Me, you who know
righteousness, a people in whose heart is My Torah: do not fear the reproach of
men, nor be afraid of their revilings. 
Isaiah
51:8  “For a moth eats them like a
garment, and a worm eats them like wool; but My righteousness is forever, and
My deliverance to all generations.” 
Isaiah
51:9  Awake, awake, put on strength, O
arm of יהוה ! Awake as in days of old, everlasting
generations. Was it not You who cut Rahaḇ apart, and pierced the
Crocodile? 
Isaiah
51:10  Was it not You who dried up the
sea, the waters of the great deep, who made the depths of the sea a way for the
redeemed to pass over? 
Isaiah
51:11  And let the ransomed of יהוה
return. And they shall come to Tsiyon with singing, with everlasting joy on
their heads. Let them attain joy and gladness; sorrow and sighing shall flee
away. 
Isaiah
51:12  “I, I am He who comforts you. Who
are you that you should be afraid of man that dies, and of the son of man who
is made like grass? 
Isaiah
51:13  “And you have forgotten יהוה
your Maker who stretched out the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth,
and you continually fear, all the day, because of the rage of the oppressor, as
he has prepared to destroy. And where is the rage of the oppressor? 
Isaiah
51:14  “Bowed, he hastens to be loosened,
that he should not die in the pit, and that his bread should not fail. 
Isaiah
51:15  “But I am יהוה
your Elohim, stirring up the sea, and its waves roar. יהוה
of hosts is His Name. 
Isaiah
51:16  “And I have put My Words in your
mouth, and with the shadow of My hand I have covered you, to plant the heavens
and lay the foundations of the earth, and to say to Tsiyon, ‘You are My people.’
” 
Isaiah
51:17  Awake, awake yourself! Rise up, O
Yerushalayim, you who have drunk at the hand of יהוה
the cup of His wrath. You have drunk the dregs of the cup of reeling, and
drained it out. 
Isaiah
51:18  Of all the sons she bore, she has
none to guide her. And of all the sons she has brought up, none takes her by
the hand. 
Isaiah
51:19  Both these are coming upon you –
who is sorry for you?: Ruin and destruction, scarcity of food and sword. How
shall I comfort you? 
Isaiah
51:20  Your sons have fainted, they lie
at the head of all the streets, like a gazelle in a net. They are filled with
the wrath of יהוה, the rebuke of your Elohim. 
Isaiah
51:21  Therefore please hear this, you
afflicted and drunk, but not with wine. 
Isaiah
51:22  Thus said your Master, יהוה
and your Elohim, who pleads the cause of His people, “See, I shall take out of
your hand the cup of reeling, the dregs of the cup of My wrath – never again
shall you drink it. 
Isaiah
51:23  “And I shall put it into the hand
of those who afflict you, who have said to your being, ‘Bow down, and we pass
over you.’ And you made your back like the ground, and as the street, to walk
over.” 
Isaiah
52:1  Awake, awake! Put on your strength,
O Tsiyon, put on your garments of splendour, O Yerushalayim, the set-apart
city! For no more do the uncircumcised and the unclean come into you. 
Isaiah
52:2  Shake yourself from the dust,
arise, and sit down, O Yerushalayim. Loose yourself from the bonds of your
neck, O captive daughter of Tsiyon! 
Isaiah
52:3  For thus said יהוה,
“You have been sold for naught, and you are redeemed not with silver.” 
Isaiah
52:4  For thus said the Master יהוה,
“At first My people went down into Mitsrayim to sojourn there, and Ashshur
oppressed them without cause. 
Isaiah
52:5  “And now, what have I here,”
declares יהוה, “that My people are taken away for
naught? Those who rule over them make them wail,” declares יהוה,
“and My Name is despised all day continually. 
Isaiah
52:6  “Therefore My people shall know My
Name, in that day, for I am the One who is speaking. See, it is I.” 
Isaiah
52:7  How pleasant upon the mountains are
the feet of him who brings good news, who proclaims peace, who brings good
news, who proclaims deliverance, who says to Tsiyon, “Your Elohim reigns!” 
Isaiah
52:8  The voice of your watchmen! They
shall lift up their voices, together they shout for joy, because eye to eye
they see the return of יהוה to Tsiyon. 
Isaiah
52:9  Break forth into joy, sing
together, you waste places of Yerushalayim! For יהוה
shall comfort His people, He shall redeem Yerushalayim. 
Isaiah
52:10  יהוה shall
lay bare His set-apart arm in the eyes of all the nations. And all the ends of
the earth shall see the deliverance of our Elohim. 
Isaiah
52:11  Turn aside! Turn aside! Come out
from there, touch not the unclean. Come out of her midst, be clean, you who
bear the vessels of יהוה. 
Isaiah
52:12  For you shall not come out in
haste, nor go in flight. For יהוה is going before you,
and the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl is your rear guard. 
Isaiah
52:13  See, My Servant shall work wisely,
He shall be exalted and lifted up and very high. 
Isaiah
52:14  As many were astonished at You –
so the disfigurement beyond any man’s and His form beyond the sons of men – 
Isaiah
52:15  He shall likewise startle many
nations. Sovereigns shut their mouths at Him, for what had not been recounted
to them they shall see, and what they had not heard they shall understand. 
Isaiah
53:1  Who has believed our report? And to
whom was the arm of יהוה revealed? 
Isaiah
53:2  For He grew up before Him as a
tender plant, and as a root out of dry ground. He has no form or splendour that
we should look upon Him, nor appearance that we should desire Him – 
Isaiah
53:3  despised and rejected by men, a man
of pains and knowing sickness. And as one from whom the face is hidden, being
despised, and we did not consider Him. 
Isaiah
53:4  Truly, He has borne our sicknesses
and carried our pains. Yet we reckoned Him stricken, smitten by Elohim, and
afflicted. 
Isaiah
53:5  But He was pierced for our
transgressions, He was crushed for our crookednesses. The chastisement for our
peace was upon Him, and by His stripes we are healed. 
Isaiah
53:6  We all, like sheep, went astray,
each one of us has turned to his own way. And יהוה has
laid on Him the crookedness of us all. 
Isaiah
53:7  He was oppressed and He was
afflicted, but He did not open His mouth. He was led as a lamb to the
slaughter, and as a sheep before its shearers is silent, but He did not open
His mouth. 
Isaiah
53:8  He was taken from prison and from
judgment. And as for His generation, who considered that He shall be cut off
from the land of the living? For the transgression of My people He was
stricken. 
Isaiah
53:9  And He was appointed a grave with the
wrong, and with the rich at His death, because He had done no violence, nor was
deceit in His mouth.
Isaiah
53:10  But יהוה
was pleased to crush Him, He laid sickness on Him, that when He made Himself an
offering for guilt, He would see a seed, He would prolong His days and the
pleasure of יהוה prosper in His hand. 
Isaiah
53:11  He would see the result of the
suffering of His life and be satisfied. Through His knowledge My righteous
Servant makes many righteous, and He bears their crookednesses. 
Isaiah
53:12  Therefore I give Him a portion
among the great, and He divides the spoil with the strong, because He poured
out His being unto death, and He was counted with the transgressors, and He
bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors. 
Isaiah
54:1  “Sing, O barren one, you who did
not bear! Break forth into singing, and cry aloud, you who have not been in
labour! For the children of the deserted one are more than the children of the
married woman,” said יהוה. 
Isaiah
54:2  “Enlarge the place of your tent,
and let them stretch out the curtains of your dwellings, spare not. Lengthen
your cords, and strengthen your stakes. 
Isaiah
54:3  “For you shall break forth to the
right and to the left, and your seed inherit the nations, and make the deserted
cities inhabited. 
Isaiah
54:4  “Do not fear, for you shall not be
put to shame, nor hurt, you shall not be humiliated. For the shame of your
youth you shall forget, and not remember the reproach of your widowhood any
more. 
Isaiah
54:5  “For your Maker is your husband, יהוה
of hosts is His Name, and the Set-apart One of Yisra’ĕl is your Redeemer.
He is called the Elohim of all the earth. 
Isaiah
54:6  “For יהוה
has called you like a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit, like a wife of
youth when you were refused,” declares your Elohim. 
Isaiah
54:7  “For a little while I have forsaken
you, but with great compassion I shall gather you. 
Isaiah
54:8  “In an overflow of wrath I hid My
face from you for a moment, but with everlasting kindness I shall have
compassion on you,” said יהוה, your Redeemer. 
Isaiah
54:9  “For this is the waters of
Noaḥ to Me, in that I have sworn that the waters of Noaḥ would
never again cover the earth, so have I sworn not to be wroth with you, nor to
rebuke you. 
Isaiah
54:10  “For though the mountains be
removed and the hills be shaken, My kindness is not removed from you, nor is My
covenant of peace shaken,” said יהוה, who has
compassion on you. 
Isaiah
54:11  “O you afflicted one, tossed with
storm, and not comforted, see, I am setting your stones in antimony, and shall
lay your foundations with sapphires, 
Isaiah
54:12  and shall make your battlements of
rubies, your gates of crystal, and all your walls of precious stones, 
Isaiah
54:13  and all your children taught by יהוה,
and the peace of your children great. 
Isaiah
54:14  “In righteousness you shall be
established – far from oppression, for you shall not fear, and far from ruin, for it does not come near
you. 
Isaiah
54:15  “See, they shall indeed assemble,
but not because of Me. Whoever shall assemble against you falls for your sake! 
Isaiah
54:16  “See, I Myself have created the
blacksmith who blows the coals in the fire, who brings forth an instrument for
his work. And I have created the waster to destroy. 
Isaiah
54:17  “No weapon formed against you
shall prosper, and every tongue which rises against you in judgment you shall
prove wrong. This is the inheritance of the servants of יהוה,
and their righteousness from Me,” declares יהוה. 
Isaiah
55:1  “Oh everyone who thirsts, come to
the waters. And you who have no silver, come, buy and eat. Come, buy wine and
milk without silver and without price. 
Isaiah
55:2  “Why do you weigh out silver for
what is not bread, and your labour for what does not satisfy? Listen, listen to
Me, and eat what is good, and let your being delight itself in fatness. 
Isaiah
55:3  “Incline your ear, and come to Me.
Hear, so that your being lives. And let Me make an everlasting covenant with
you, the trustworthy kindnesses of Dawiḏ. 
Isaiah
55:4  “See, I have given Him as a witness
to the people, a Leader and a Commander for the people. 
Isaiah
55:5  “See, a nation you do not know you
shall call, and a nation who does not know you run to you, because of יהוה
your Elohim, and the Set-apart One of Yisra’ĕl, for He has adorned you.” 
Isaiah
55:6  Seek יהוה
while He is to be found, call on Him while He is near. 
Isaiah
55:7  Let the wrong forsake his way, and
the unrighteous man his thoughts. Let him return to יהוה,
who has compassion on him, and to our Elohim, for He pardons much. 
Isaiah
55:8  “For My thoughts are not your
thoughts, neither are your ways My ways,” declares יהוה.

Isaiah
55:9  “For as the heavens are higher than
the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways, and My thoughts than your
thoughts. 
Isaiah
55:10  “For as the rain comes down, and
the snow from the heavens, and do not return there, but water the earth, and
make it bring forth and bud, and give seed to the sower and bread to the eater,

Isaiah
55:11  so is My Word that goes forth from
My mouth – it does not return to Me empty, but shall do what I please, and
shall certainly accomplish what I sent it for. 
Isaiah
55:12  “For with joy you go out, and with
peace you are brought in – the mountains and the hills break forth into singing
before you, and all the trees of the field clap the hands. 
Isaiah
55:13  “Instead of the thorn the cypress
comes up, and instead of the nettle the myrtle comes up. And it shall be to יהוה
for a name, for an everlasting sign which is not cut off.” 
Isaiah
56:1  Thus said יהוה,
“Guard right-ruling, and do righteousness, for near is My deliverance to come,
and My righteousness to be revealed. 
Isaiah
56:2  “Blessed is the man who does this,
and the son of man who lays hold on it, guarding the Sabbath lest he profane
it, and guarding his hand from doing any evil. 
Isaiah
56:3  “And let not the son of the
foreigner who has joined himself to יהוה speak, saying,
‘ יהוה has certainly separated me from His people,’ nor
let the eunuch say, ‘Look I am a dry tree.’ ” 
Isaiah
56:4  For thus said יהוה,
“To the eunuchs who guard My Sabbaths, and have chosen what pleases Me, and
hold fast to My covenant: 
Isaiah
56:5  to them I shall give in My house
and within My walls a place and a name better than that of sons and daughters –
I give them an everlasting name that is not cut off. 
Isaiah
56:6  “Also the sons of the foreigner who
join themselves to יהוה, to serve Him, and to love the
Name of יהוה, to be His servants, all who guard the
Sabbath, and not profane it, and hold fast to My covenant – 
Isaiah
56:7  them I shall bring to My set-apart
mountain, and let them rejoice in My house of prayer. Their burnt offerings and
their slaughterings are accepted on My altar, for My house is called a house of
prayer for all the peoples.” 
Isaiah
56:8  The Master יהוה,
who gathers the outcasts of Yisra’ĕl, declares, “I gather still others to him besides those who are
gathered to him.” 
Isaiah
56:9  All you beasts of the field, come
to devour, all you beasts in the forest. 
Isaiah
56:10  His watchmen are blind, all of
them, they have not known. All of them are dumb dogs, unable to bark, dreaming,
lying down, loving to slumber. 
Isaiah
56:11  And the dogs have a strong
appetite, they never have enough. And they are shepherds! They have not known
understanding. All of them look to their own way, every one for his own gain,
from his own end, saying, 
Isaiah
56:12  “Come, let me bring wine and fill
ourselves with strong drink. And tomorrow shall be as today, even much greater.”
Isaiah
57:1  The righteous one has perished, and
no one takes it to heart. And kind men are taken away, while no one understands
that the righteous one is taken away from the presence of evil, 
Isaiah
57:2  he enters into peace. They who walk
in integrity rest on their beds. 
Isaiah
57:3  “But come here, you sons of the
sorceress, you offspring of the adulterer and the whore! 
Isaiah
57:4  Against whom are you sporting?
Against whom do you make a wide mouth and stick out the tongue? Are you not children
of transgression, offspring of falsehood, 
Isaiah
57:5  being inflamed with mighty ones
under every green tree, slaying the children in the valleys, under the clefts
of the rocks? 
Isaiah
57:6  “Among the smooth stones of the
stream is your portion; they, they, are your lot! Also to them you have poured
a drink offering, you have offered a grain offering. Am I comforted in these? 
Isaiah
57:7  “On a high and lofty mountain you
have set your bed. There, too, you went up to make an offering. 
Isaiah
57:8  “Also behind the doors and their
posts you have set up your remembrance. For you have departed from Me, and have
gone up to them. You have made your bed wide and made a covenant with them. You
have loved their bed, where you saw their hand. 
Isaiah
57:9  “And you went to the sovereign with
ointment, and increased your perfumes. And you sent your messengers far off,
and lowered yourself even to the grave. 
Isaiah
57:10  “You have wearied yourselves with
your many wanderings, yet you did not say, ‘I give up!’ You have found the life
of your hand, therefore you were not grieved. 
Isaiah
57:11  “And of whom have you been afraid,
or feared, that you have lied and not remembered Me, nor taken it to your
heart? Have I not been silent, even from of old, and you have not feared Me? 
Isaiah
57:12  “Let Me declare your righteousness
and your works, for they do not profit you. 
Isaiah
57:13  “When you cry out, let your
collection of idols deliver you. But
the wind shall bear them all away, a breath take them. But he who takes refuge
in Me shall inherit the land, and possess My set-apart mountain.” 
Isaiah
57:14  And one shall say, “Heap it up!
Heap it up! Prepare the way, take the stumbling-block out of the way of My
people.” 
Isaiah
57:15  For thus declares the high and
exalted One who dwells forever, whose Name is set-apart, “I dwell in the high
and set-apart place, with him who has a bruised and humble spirit, to revive
the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of bruised ones. 
Isaiah
57:16  “For I would not strive forever,
nor am I wroth forever, for the spirit would grow faint before Me, even the
beings I have made. 
Isaiah
57:17  “For the crookedness of his unfair
gain I was wroth and I smote him. I hid Myself and was wroth, and he went on
backsliding in the way of his heart. 
Isaiah
57:18  “I have seen his ways, but now I heal him, and I lead him, and
restore comforts to him and to his mourners, 
Isaiah
57:19  creating the fruit of the lips:
peace, peace to him who is far off and to him who is near,” said יהוה,
“and I shall heal him.” 
Isaiah
57:20  But the wrong are like the
troubled sea, for it is unable to rest, and its waters cast up mud and dirt. 
Isaiah
57:21  “There is no peace,” said my
Elohim, “for the wrong.” 
Isaiah
58:1  “Cry aloud, do not spare. Lift up
your voice like a ram’s horn. Declare to My people their transgression, and the
house of Ya‛aqoḇ their sins. 
Isaiah
58:2  “Yet they seek Me day by day, and
delight to know My ways, as a nation that did righteousness, and did not
forsake the right-ruling of their Elohim. They ask of Me rulings of
righteousness, they delight in drawing near to Elohim. 
Isaiah
58:3  They
say, ‘Why have we fasted, and You have not seen? Why have we afflicted our
beings, and You took no note?’ “Look, in the day of your fasting you find
pleasure, and drive on all your labourers. 
Isaiah
58:4  “Look, you fast for strife and
contention, and to strike with the fist of wrongness. You do not fast as you do
this day, to make your voice heard on high. 
Isaiah
58:5  “Is it a fast that I have chosen, a
day for a man to afflict his being? Is it to bow down his head like a bulrush,
and to spread out sackcloth and ashes? Do you call this a fast, and an
acceptable day to יהוה ? 
Isaiah
58:6  “Is this not the fast that I have
chosen: to loosen the tight cords of wrongness, to undo the bands of the yoke,
to exempt the oppressed, and to break off every yoke? 
Isaiah
58:7  “Is it not to share your bread with
the hungry, and that you bring to your house the poor who are cast out; when
you see the naked, and cover him, and not hide yourself from your own flesh? 
Isaiah
58:8  “Then your light would break forth
like the morning, your healing spring forth speedily. And your righteousness
shall go before you, the esteem of יהוה would be your
rear guard. 
Isaiah
58:9  “Then, when you call, יהוה
would answer; when you cry, He would say, ‘Here I am.’ “If you take away the
yoke from your midst, the pointing of the finger, and the speaking of
unrighteousness, 
Isaiah
58:10  if you extend your being to the
hungry and satisfy the afflicted being, then your light shall dawn in the
darkness, and your darkness be as noon. 
Isaiah
58:11  “Then יהוה
would guide you continually, and satisfy your being in drought, and strengthen
your bones. And you shall be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water,
whose waters do not fail. 
Isaiah
58:12  “And those from among you shall
build the old waste places. You shall raise up the foundations of many
generations. And you would be called the Repairer of the Breach, the Restorer
of Streets to Dwell In. 
Isaiah
58:13  “If you do turn back your foot
from the Sabbath, from doing your pleasure on My set-apart day, and shall call the Sabbath ‘a delight,’ the set-apart day of יהוה
‘esteemed,’ and shall esteem it, not doing your own ways, nor finding your own
pleasure, nor speaking your own words,
Isaiah
58:14  then you shall delight yourself in
יהוה. And I shall cause you to ride on the heights of
the earth, and feed you with the inheritance of Ya‛aqoḇ your
father. For the mouth of יהוה has spoken!” 
Isaiah
59:1  Look, the hand of יהוה
has not become too short to save, nor His ear too heavy to hear. 
Isaiah
59:2  But your crookednesses have
separated you from your Elohim. And your sins have hidden His face from you,
from hearing. 
Isaiah
59:3  For your hands have been defiled
with blood, and your fingers with crookedness; your lips have spoken falsehood,
your tongue mutters unrighteousness. 
Isaiah
59:4  No one calls for righteousness, and
no one pleads for truth. They trust in emptiness and speak worthlessness; they
conceive trouble and bring forth wickedness. 
Isaiah
59:5  They have hatched adders’ eggs and
they weave the spider’s web. Whoever eats their eggs dies, and when one is
broken an adder is hatched. 
Isaiah
59:6  Their webs do not become garments,
nor do they cover themselves with their works. Their works are works of
wickedness, and a deed of violence is in their hands. 
Isaiah
59:7  Their feet run to evil, and they
hurry to shed innocent blood. Their thoughts are thoughts of wickedness,
wasting and ruin are in their highways. 
Isaiah
59:8  The way of peace they have not
known, and there is no right-ruling in their ways. They have made crooked paths
for themselves, whoever treads in them shall not know peace. 
Isaiah
59:9  Therefore right-ruling has been far
from us, and righteousness does not reach us. We look for light, but there is
darkness; for brightness, but we walk in thick darkness! 
Isaiah
59:10  We feel for the wall like the
blind, and we feel as without eyes. At noon we stumble as at twilight, in
deserted places, like the dead. 
Isaiah
59:11  All of us growl like bears, and
moan sadly like doves. We look for right-ruling, but there is none; for
deliverance, but it is far from us. 
Isaiah
59:12  For our transgressions have
increased before You, and our sins witnessed against us. For our transgressions
are with us, and as for our crookednesses, we know them: 
Isaiah
59:13  transgressing, and being untrue to
יהוה, and turning away from our Elohim, speaking
oppression and apostasy, conceiving and pondering words of falsehood from the
heart. 
Isaiah
59:14  And right-ruling is driven back,
and righteousness stands far off. For truth has fallen in the street, and right
is unable to enter.
Isaiah
59:15  And the truth is lacking, and
whoever turns away from evil makes himself a prey. And יהוה
saw, and it displeased Him that there was no right-ruling. 
Isaiah
59:16  And He saw that there was no man,
and was astonished that there was no intercessor. So His own arm saved for Him,
and His righteousness upheld him. 
Isaiah
59:17  And He put on righteousness as a
breastplate, and a helmet of deliverance on His head. And He put on garments of
vengeance for clothing, and wrapped Himself with ardour as a mantle. 
Isaiah
59:18  According to their deeds, so He
repays, wrath to His adversaries, recompense to His enemies. He repays
recompense to the coastlands. 
Isaiah
59:19  And they shall fear the Name of יהוה
from the west, and His esteem from the rising of the sun, when He comes like a
distressing stream which the Spirit of יהוה drives on. 
Isaiah
59:20  “And the Redeemer shall come to
Tsiyon, and to those turning from transgression in Ya‛aqoḇ,”
declares יהוה. 
Isaiah
59:21  “As for Me, this is My covenant
with them,” said יהוה : “My Spirit that is upon you,
and My Words that I have put in your mouth, shall not be withdrawn from your
mouth, nor from the mouth of your descendants, nor from the mouth of your
descendants’ descendants,” said יהוה, “from this time
and forever.” 
Isaiah
60:1  “Arise, shine, for your light has
come! And the esteem of יהוה has risen upon you. 
Isaiah
60:2  “For look, darkness covers the
earth, and thick darkness the peoples. But יהוה arises
over you, and His esteem is seen upon you. 
Isaiah
60:3  “And the gentiles shall come to
your light, and sovereigns to the brightness of your rising.
Isaiah
60:4  “Lift up your eyes all around and
see: all of them have gathered, they have come to you; your sons come from
afar, and your daughters are supported on the side. 
Isaiah
60:5  “Then you shall see and be bright,
and your heart shall throb and swell, for the wealth of the sea is turned to
you, the riches of the gentiles come to you. 
Isaiah
60:6  “A stream of camels cover your
land, the dromedaries of Miḏyan and Ĕphah; all those from Sheḇa
come, bearing gold and incense, and proclaiming the praises of יהוה.

Isaiah
60:7  “All the flocks of Qĕḏar
are gathered to you, the rams of Neḇayoth serve you; they come up for
acceptance on My altar, and I embellish My esteemed House. 
Isaiah
60:8  “Who are these who fly like a
cloud, and like doves to their windows? 
Isaiah
60:9  “Because the coastlands wait for
Me, and the ships of Tarshish first, to bring your sons from afar, their silver
and their gold with them, to the Name of יהוה your
Elohim, and to the Set-apart One of Yisra’ĕl, because He has adorned you. 
Isaiah
60:10  “And the sons of foreigners shall
build your walls, and their sovereigns serve you. For in My wrath I have
smitten you, but in My delight I shall have compassion on you. 
Isaiah
60:11  “And your gates shall be open
continually, they are not shut day or night, to bring to you the wealth of the
gentiles, and their sovereigns in procession. 
Isaiah
60:12  “For the nation and the reign that
do not serve you shall perish, and those gentiles shall be utterly laid waste. 
Isaiah
60:13  “The esteem of Leḇanon shall
come to you, cypress, pine, and the box tree together, to embellish the place
of My set-apart place. And I shall make the place of My feet esteemed. 
Isaiah
60:14  “And the sons of those who
afflicted you come bowing to you, and all those who despised you shall bow
themselves at the soles of your feet. And they shall call you: City of יהוה,
Tsiyon of the Set-apart One of Yisra’ĕl. 
Isaiah
60:15  “Instead of you being forsaken and
hated, so that no one passes through you, I shall make you an everlasting
excellence, a joy of many generations. 
Isaiah
60:16  “And you shall drink dry the milk
of the gentiles, and shall milk the breast of sovereigns. And you shall know
that I, יהוה, your Saviour and your Redeemer, am the
Elohim of Ya‛aqoḇ. 
Isaiah
60:17  “Instead of bronze I bring gold,
and instead of iron I bring silver, and bronze instead of wood, and iron
instead of stones. And I shall make your officers peace, and your magistrates
righteousness. 
Isaiah
60:18  “Violence shall no longer be heard
in your land, neither wasting nor ruin within your borders. And you shall call
your walls Deliverance, and your gates Praise. 
Isaiah
60:19  “No longer is the sun your light
by day, nor does the moon give light to you for brightness, but יהוה
shall be to you an everlasting light, and your Elohim your comeliness. 
Isaiah
60:20  “No longer does your sun go down,
nor your moon withdraw itself, for יהוה shall be your
everlasting light, and the days of your mourning shall be ended. 
Isaiah
60:21  “And your people, all of them
righteous, shall inherit the earth forever – a branch of My planting, a work of
My hands, to be adorned. 
Isaiah
60:22  “The little shall become a
thousand, and the small one a strong nation. I, יהוה,
shall hasten it in its time.”
Isaiah
61:1  The Spirit of the Master יהוה
is upon Me, because יהוה has anointed Me to bring good
news to the meek. He has sent Me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim
release to the captives, and the opening of the prison to those who are bound, 
Isaiah
61:2  to proclaim the acceptable year of יהוה,
and the day of vengeance of our Elohim, to comfort all who mourn, 
Isaiah
61:3  to appoint unto those who mourn in
Tsiyon: to give them embellishment for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the
garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness. And they shall be called trees
of righteousness, a planting of יהוה, to be adorned. 
Isaiah
61:4  And they shall rebuild the old
ruins, raise up the former wastes. And they shall restore the ruined cities,
the wastes of many generations. 
Isaiah
61:5  And strangers shall stand and feed
your flocks, and the sons of the foreigner be your ploughmen and your
vinedressers. 
Isaiah
61:6  But you shall be called, ‘Priests
of יהוה,’ ‘Servants of our Elohim’ shall be said of
you. You shall consume the strength of the gentiles, and boast in their esteem.

Isaiah
61:7  Instead of your shame and reproach,
they rejoice a second time in their portion. Therefore they take possession a
second time in their land, everlasting joy is theirs. 
Isaiah
61:8  “For I, יהוה,
love right-ruling; I hate robbery for burnt offering. And I shall give their
reward in truth, and make an everlasting covenant with them. 
Isaiah
61:9  “And their seed shall be known
among the gentiles, and their offspring in the midst of the peoples. All who
see them shall acknowledge them, that they are the seed יהוה
has blessed.” 
Isaiah
61:10  I greatly rejoice in יהוה,
my being exults in my Elohim. For He has put garments of deliverance on me, He
has covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decks himself
with ornaments, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels. 
Isaiah
61:11  For as the earth brings forth its
bud, as the garden causes the seed to shoot up, so the Master יהוה
causes righteousness and praise to shoot up before all the nations! 
Isaiah
62:1  For Tsiyon’s sake I am not silent,
and for Yerushalayim’s sake I do not rest, until her righteousness goes forth
as brightness, and her deliverance as a lamp that burns. 
Isaiah
62:2  And the nations shall see your
righteousness, and all sovereigns your esteem. And you shall be called by a new
name, which the mouth of יהוה designates. 
Isaiah
62:3  And you shall be a crown of
comeliness in the hand of יהוה, and a royal head-dress
in the hand of your Elohim. 
Isaiah
62:4  No longer are you called “Forsaken,”
and no longer is your land called “Deserted.” But you shall be called “Ḥephtsiḇah,”
and your land “Married,” for יהוה shall delight in you,
and your land be married.
Isaiah
62:5  For as a young man marries a
maiden, so shall your sons marry you. And as the bridegroom rejoices over the
bride, so shall your Elohim rejoice over you. 
Isaiah
62:6  I have set watchmen on your walls,
O Yerushalayim, all the day and all the night, continually, who are not silent.
You who remember יהוה, give yourselves no rest, 
Isaiah
62:7  and give Him no rest till He
establishes and till He makes Yerushalayim a praise in the earth. 
Isaiah
62:8  יהוה has
sworn by His right hand and by the arm of His strength, “No more do I give your
grain to be food for your enemies, nor do sons of the foreigner drink your new
wine, for which you have laboured;
Isaiah
62:9  but those gathering it shall eat
it, and praise יהוה. And those collecting it shall
drink it in My set-apart courts.” 
Isaiah
62:10  Pass through, pass through the
gates! Prepare the way for the people. Build up, build up the highway! Remove
the stones. Lift up a banner for the peoples! 
Isaiah
62:11  See, יהוה
has proclaimed to the end of the earth: “Say to the daughter of Tsiyon, ‘See,
your deliverance has come; see, His reward is with Him, and His work before
Him.’ ” 
Isaiah
62:12  And they shall be called, “The
Set-apart People, the Redeemed of יהוה.” And you shall
be called, “Sought Out, a City Not Forsaken.” 
Isaiah
63:1  Who is this coming from Eḏom,
with garments of glowing colours from Botsrah, who is robed in splendour,
striding forward in the greatness of His strength? “It is I who speak in
righteousness, mighty to save.” 
Isaiah
63:2  Why is there red on Your raiment,
and Your garments like one who treads in the winepress? 
Isaiah
63:3  “I have trodden the winepress
alone, and from the peoples no one was with Me. And I trod them down in My
displeasure, and I trampled them in My wrath. Their blood is sprinkled upon My
garments, and I have defiled all My raiment. 
Isaiah
63:4  “For a day of vengeance is in My
heart, and the year of My redeemed has come. 
Isaiah
63:5  “And I looked, but there was none
helping, and I was astonished that there was none upholding. So My own arm
saved for Me, and My wrath upheld Me. 
Isaiah
63:6  “And I trod down peoples in My
displeasure, and made them drunk in My wrath, and brought down their strength
to earth.” 
Isaiah
63:7  Let me recount the kindnesses of יהוה
and the praises of יהוה, according to all that יהוה
has done for us, and the great goodness toward the house of Yisra’ĕl,
which He has done for them according to His compassion, and according to His
many kindnesses. 
Isaiah
63:8  And He said, “They are My people,
children who do not act falsely.” And He became their Saviour. 
Isaiah
63:9  In all their distress He was
distressed, and the Messenger of His Presence saved them. In His love and in
His compassion He redeemed them, and He lifted them up and carried them all the
days of old. 
Isaiah
63:10  But they rebelled and grieved His
Set-apart Spirit, so He turned against them as an enemy, and He fought against
them. 
Isaiah
63:11  Then He remembered the days of
old, Mosheh, His people, “Where is He who brought them up out of the sea with
the shepherd of His flock? Where is He who put His Set-apart Spirit within him,

Isaiah
63:12  who led them by the right hand of
Mosheh, with His comely arm, dividing the water before them to make for Himself
an everlasting Name, 
Isaiah
63:13  who led them through the deep?
Like a horse in the wilderness they did not stumble.” 
Isaiah
63:14  As a beast goes down into the
valley, and the Spirit of יהוה causes him to rest, so
You led Your people, to make Yourself a comely Name. 
Isaiah
63:15  Look down from the heavens, and
see from Your set-apart and comely dwelling. Where are Your ardour and Your
might, the stirring of Your inward parts and Your compassion toward me? Are
they withheld? 
Isaiah
63:16  For You are our Father, though Aḇraham
does not know us, and Yisra’ĕl does not recognise us. You, O יהוה,
are our Father, our Redeemer – Your Name is from of old. 
Isaiah
63:17  O יהוה,
why do You make us stray from Your ways, and harden our heart from Your fear?
Turn back, for the sake of Your servants, the tribes of Your inheritance. 
Isaiah
63:18  For a little while Your set-apart
people possessed it – our adversaries have trodden down Your set-apart place.
Isaiah
63:19  We have become like those over
whom You never ruled – Your Name is not called on them! 
Isaiah
64:1  Oh, that You would tear the heavens
open, come down, that mountains shall shake before Your ? – 
Isaiah
64:2  as when fire burns twigs, as fire
makes water boil – to make Your Name known to Your adversaries, so that nations
tremble before You. 
Isaiah
64:3  When You did awesome matters, which we did not expect, You
came down, mountains did shake before You! 
Isaiah
64:4  Since the beginning of the ages
they have not heard nor perceived by the ear, nor has the eye seen any Elohim
besides You, who acts for those who wait for Him. 
Isaiah
64:5  You shall meet him who rejoices and
does righteousness, who remembers You in Your ways. See, You were wroth when we
sinned in them a long time. And should we be saved? 
Isaiah
64:6  And all of us have become as one
unclean, and all our righteousnesses are as soiled rags. And all of us fade
like a leaf, and our crookednesses, like the wind, have taken us away. 
Isaiah
64:7  And there is no one who calls on
Your Name, who stirs himself up to take hold of You; for You have hidden Your
face from us, and have consumed us because of our crookednesses. 
Isaiah
64:8  And now, O יהוה,
You are our Father. We are the clay, and You our potter. And we are all the
work of Your hand. 
Isaiah
64:9  Do not be wroth, O יהוה,
nor remember crookedness forever. See, please look, all of us are Your people! 
Isaiah
64:10  Your set-apart cities have become
a wilderness, Tsiyon has become a wilderness, Yerushalayim a waste. 
Isaiah
64:11  Our set-apart and comely House,
where our fathers praised You, has been burned up with fire. And all that we
treasured has become a ruin. 
Isaiah
64:12  In view of all this, would You
restrain Yourself, O יהוה ? Would You keep silent and
afflict us beyond measure? 
Isaiah
65:1  “I have let Myself be inquired of,
not by those who asked; I was found, not by those who sought Me. I said, ‘Here
I am, here I am,’ to a nation not calling on My Name. 
Isaiah
65:2  “I have held out My hands all day
long to a stubborn people, who walk in a way that is not good, after their own
thoughts; 
Isaiah
65:3  the people who provoke Me
continually to My face, who slaughter in gardens, and burn incense on altars of
brick; 
Isaiah
65:4  who sit among the graves, and spend
the night in secret places, who eat flesh of pigs, and the broth of unclean meat is in their pots,
Isaiah
65:5  who say, ‘Keep to yourself, do not
come near me, for I am set-apart to you!’ These are smoke in My nostrils, a
fire that burns all day. 
Isaiah
65:6  “See, it is written before Me: I am
not silent, but shall repay, and I shall repay into their bosom, 
Isaiah
65:7  your crookednesses and the
crookednesses of your fathers together,” said יהוה, “who
burned incense on the mountains and reproached Me on the hills. And I shall
measure their former work into their bosom.” 
Isaiah
65:8  Thus said יהוה,
“As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one shall say, ‘Do not destroy
it, for there is blessing in it,’ so I do for My servants’ sake, not to destroy
them all.
Isaiah
65:9  “And I shall bring forth a seed
from Ya‛aqoḇ, and from Yehuḏah an heir of My mountains. And
My chosen ones shall inherit it, and My servants dwell there. 
Isaiah
65:10  “And Sharon shall be a fold of
flocks, and the Valley of Aḵor a place for herds to lie down, for My
people who have sought Me. 
Isaiah
65:11  “But you are those who forsake יהוה,
who forget My set-apart mountain, who prepare a table for Gad, and who fill a
drink offering for Meni. 
Isaiah
65:12  “And I shall allot you to the sword,
and let you all bow down to the slaughter, because I called and you did not
answer, I spoke and you did not hear, and you did evil before My eyes and chose
that in which I did not delight.” 
Isaiah
65:13  Therefore thus said the Master יהוה,
“See, My servants eat, but you hunger; see, My servants drink, but you thirst;
see, My servants rejoice, but you are put to shame; 
Isaiah
65:14  see, My servants sing for joy of
heart, but you cry for sorrow of heart, and wail for breaking of spirit. 
Isaiah
65:15  “And you shall leave your name as
a curse to My chosen, for the Master יהוה shall put you
to death, and call His servants by another name, 
Isaiah
65:16  so that he who blesses himself in
the earth does bless himself in the Elohim of truth. And he who swears in the
earth does swear by the Elohim of truth. Because the former distresses shall be
forgotten, and because they shall be hidden from My eyes. 
Isaiah
65:17  “For look, I am creating new
heavens and a new earth, and the former shall not be remembered, nor come to
heart. 
Isaiah
65:18  “But be glad and rejoice forever
in what I create; for look, I create Yerushalayim a rejoicing, and her people a
joy. 
Isaiah
65:19  “And I shall rejoice in
Yerushalayim, and shall joy in My people, and let the voice of weeping no more
be heard in her, nor the voice of crying. 
Isaiah
65:20  “No more is an infant from there
going to live but a few days, nor an old man who does not complete his days,
for the youth dies one hundred years old, but the sinner being one hundred
years old shall be lightly esteemed. 
Isaiah
65:21  “And they shall build houses and
inhabit them, and plant vineyards and eat their fruit. 
Isaiah
65:22  “They shall not build and another
inhabit; they shall not plant and another eat. For the days of My people are
going to be as the days of a tree, and My chosen ones outlive the work of their
hands. 
Isaiah
65:23  “They shall not labour in vain,
nor bring forth children for trouble. For they are the seed of the blessed of יהוה,
and their offspring with them. 
Isaiah
65:24  “And it shall be that before they
call, I answer. And while they are still speaking, I hear.
Isaiah
65:25  “Wolf and lamb feed together, a
lion eats straw as an ox, and dust is the snake’s food. They shall do no evil,
nor destroy in all My set-apart mountain,” said יהוה. 
Isaiah
66:1  Thus said יהוה,
“The heavens are My throne, and the earth is My footstool. Where is this house
that you build for Me? And where is this place of My rest? 
Isaiah
66:2  “And all these My hand have made,
and all these that exist,” declares יהוה. “Yet to such
a one I look: on him who is poor and bruised of spirit, and who trembles at My
Word. 
Isaiah
66:3  “But whoever slaughters the bull slays a man; whoever slaughters the
lamb breaks a dog’s neck; whoever brings a grain offering – pig’s blood;
whoever burns incense blesses an idol. Indeed, they have chosen their own ways,
and their being delights in their abominations. 
Isaiah
66:4  “I shall also choose their
punishments, and bring their fears on them. Because I called, but no one
answered. I spoke and they did not hear, and they did evil before My eyes, and
chose what was displeasing to Me.” 
Isaiah
66:5  Hear the Word of יהוה,
you who tremble at His Word, “Your brothers who hate you, who cast you out for
My Name’s sake, said, ‘Let יהוה be esteemed, so that we
see your joy.’ But they are put to shame.” 
Isaiah
66:6  “A roaring sound from the city, a
voice from the Hĕḵal, the voice of יהוה,
repaying His enemies! 
Isaiah
66:7  “Before she laboured, she gave
birth; before a pain came to her, she was delivered of a male child. 
Isaiah
66:8  “Who has heard the like of this?
Who has seen the like of these? Is a land brought forth in one day? Is a nation
born at once? For as soon as Tsiyon laboured, she gave birth to her children. 
Isaiah
66:9  “Shall I bring to birth, and not
give delivery?” says יהוה. “Shall I who give delivery
restrain birth?” said your Elohim. 
Isaiah
66:10  “Rejoice with Yerushalayim, and be
glad with her, all you who love her; rejoice greatly with her, all you who
mourn for her; 
Isaiah
66:11  so that you feed, and shall be
satisfied with the breast of her comforts, so that you drink deeply, and shall
delight yourselves in her overflowing esteem.” 
Isaiah
66:12  For thus said יהוה,
“See, I am extending peace to her like a river, and the esteem of the gentiles
like a flowing stream. And you shall feed; you shall be carried on the side,
and be fondled on her knees. 
Isaiah
66:13  “As one whom his mother comforts,
so I comfort you. And in Yerushalayim you are comforted.” 
Isaiah
66:14  “And you shall see, and your heart
shall rejoice, and your bones flourish as tender grass. And the hand of יהוה
shall be known to His servants, and His displeasure to His enemies. 
Isaiah
66:15  “For look, יהוה
comes with fire and with His chariots, like a whirlwind, to render His
displeasure with burning, and His rebuke with flames of fire. 
Isaiah
66:16  “For by fire and by His sword יהוה
shall judge all flesh, and the slain of יהוה shall be
many – 
Isaiah
66:17  those who set themselves apart and
cleanse themselves at the gardens after ‘One’ in the midst, eating flesh of
pigs and the abomination and the mouse, are snatched away, together,” declares יהוה.
Isaiah
66:18  “And I, because of their works and
their imaginations, am coming to gather all nations and tongues. And they shall
come and see My esteem. 
Isaiah
66:19  “And I shall set a sign among
them, and shall send some of those who escape to the nations – Tarshish and Pul
and Luḏ, who draw the bow, and Tuḇal and Yawan, the coastlands afar
off who have not heard My report nor seen My esteem. And they shall declare My
esteem among the gentiles. 
Isaiah
66:20  “And they shall bring all your
brothers as an offering to יהוה out of all the
gentiles, on horses and in chariots and in litters, on mules and on camels, to
My set-apart mountain Yerushalayim,” declares יהוה, “as
the children of Yisra’ĕl bring an offering in a clean vessel into the
House of יהוה. 
Isaiah
66:21  “And from them too I shall take
for priests – for Lĕwites,” declares יהוה. 
Isaiah
66:22  “For as the new heavens and the
new earth that I make stand before Me,” declares יהוה, “so
your seed and your name shall stand. 
Isaiah
66:23  “And it shall be that from New
Moon to New Moon, and from Sabbath to Sabbath, all flesh shall come to worship
before Me,” declares יהוה. 
Isaiah
66:24  “And they shall go forth and look
upon the corpses of the men who have transgressed against Me. For their worm
shall not die, and their fire not be quenched. And they shall be repulsive to
all flesh!”
