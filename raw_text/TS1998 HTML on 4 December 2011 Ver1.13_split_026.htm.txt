Psalm
78:57  But they turned back And acted
treacherously like their fathers; They twisted like a treacherous bow.
Psalm
78:58  For they enraged Him with their
high places, And moved Him to jealousy with their carved images.
Psalm
78:59  When Elohim heard this, He was
wroth, And greatly despised Yisra’ĕl,
Psalm
78:60  And He left the Dwelling Place of
Shiloh, The Tent which He had set up among men.
Psalm
78:61  And He gave His strength into captivity,
And His comeliness into the hand of the adversary.
Psalm
78:62  And He gave His people over to the
sword, And He was wroth with His inheritance.
Psalm
78:63  His young men were consumed by
fire, And His maidens were not praised.
Psalm
78:64  His priests fell by the sword, And
their widows could not weep.
Psalm
78:65  Then יהוה
awoke as one asleep, As a mighty man who shouts because of wine.
Psalm
78:66  And He smote His adversaries
backward, He put them to an everlasting reproach.
Psalm
78:67  Then He rejected the tent of Yosĕph,
And did not choose the tribe of Ephrayim,
Psalm
78:68  But chose the tribe of Yehuḏah,
Mount Tsiyon, which He loved.
Psalm
78:69  And He built His set-apart place
like the heights, Like the earth He founded it forever.
Psalm
78:70  And He chose Dawiḏ His
servant, And took him from the sheepfolds;
Psalm
78:71  He brought him in from tending the
ewes, To shepherd Ya‛aqoḇ His people, And Yisra’ĕl His
inheritance.
Psalm
78:72  And he shepherded them According
to the integrity of his heart, And led them by the skill of his hands.
Psalm
79:1  O Elohim, the gentiles have come
into Your inheritance; They have defiled Your set-apart Hĕḵal; They
turned Yerushalayim into ruins.
Psalm
79:2  They have given the dead bodies of
Your servants As food for the birds of the heavens, The flesh of Your kind ones
to the wild beast of the earth.
Psalm
79:3  They have poured out their blood
Like water all around Yerushalayim, With no one to bury them.
Psalm
79:4  We have become a reproach to our
neighbours, A scorn and a mockery to those who are around us.
Psalm
79:5  How long, O יהוה,
Would You be enraged forever? Would Your jealousy burn like fire?
Psalm
79:6  Pour out Your wrath on the gentiles
Who have not known You, And on reigns that have not called on Your Name.
Psalm
79:7  For they have devoured Ya‛aqoḇ,
And laid waste his pasture.
Psalm
79:8  Do not remember against us The
crookednesses of the fathers! Let Your compassion speedily meet us, For we have
been greatly weakened.
Psalm
79:9  Help us, O Elohim of our
deliverance, For the sake of the esteem of Your Name. And deliver us, and cover
over our sins, For Your Name’s sake!
Psalm
79:10  Why should the gentiles say, “Where
is their Elohim?” Let the vengeance of the outpoured blood of Your servants Be
known among the gentiles, Before our eyes.
Psalm
79:11  Let the groaning of the prisoner
come before You. According to the greatness of Your arm Preserve those
appointed to death.
Psalm
79:12  And repay to our neighbours
sevenfold Their reproach, into their bosom, With which they have reproached
You, O יהוה.
Psalm
79:13  And we, Your people and the sheep
of Your pasture, We give thanks to You forever; From generation to generation
we show forth Your praise.
Psalm
80:1  Give ear, O Shepherd of Yisra’ĕl,
Who lead Yosĕph like a flock; Who dwell between the keruḇim, shine
forth!
Psalm
80:2  Before Ephrayim, Binyamin, and
Menashsheh, Stir up Your might, And come and save us!
Psalm
80:3  Cause us to turn back, O Elohim,
And cause Your face to shine, That we might be saved!
Psalm
80:4  O יהוה
Elohim of hosts, How long shall You be wroth Against the prayer of Your people?
Psalm
80:5  You have caused them to eat the
bread of tears, And have caused them to drink With tears, a third time.
Psalm
80:6  You have made us a strife to our
neighbours, And our enemies laugh among themselves.
Psalm
80:7  Turn us back, O Elohim of hosts,
And cause Your face to shine, That we might be saved!
Psalm
80:8  You brought a vine out of Mitsrayim;
You drove out the nations, and planted it.
Psalm
80:9  You cleared a place for it, And
caused it to take deep root, And it filled the land.
Psalm
80:10  Hills were covered with its
shadow, And the mighty cedars with its twigs.
Psalm
80:11  She spread her branches to the
Sea, And her shoots to the River.
Psalm
80:12  Why have You broken down her
hedges, So that every passer-by plucked her fruit?
Psalm
80:13  The boar out of the forest ravages
it, And the wild beast of the field devours it.
Psalm
80:14  Return, we beg You, O Elohim of
hosts; Look down from heaven, and see, And visit this vine,
Psalm
80:15  And the stock which Your right
hand has planted, And the Son whom You made strong for Yourself.
Psalm
80:16  It is burned with fire, it is cut
down; They perish at the rebuke of Your face.
Psalm
80:17  Let Your hand be upon the One at
Your right hand, Upon the Son of Aḏam whom You made strong for Yourself,
Psalm
80:18  And we shall not backslide from
You. Revive us, and let us call upon Your Name.
Psalm
80:19  Turn us back, O יהוה
Elohim of hosts, And cause Your face to shine, That we might be saved!
Psalm
81:1  Shout for joy to Elohim our
strength; Raise a shout to the Elohim of Ya‛aqoḇ.
Psalm
81:2  Lift up a song and beat the
tambourine, The pleasant lyre and with the harp.
Psalm
81:3  Blow the ram’s horn at the time of
the New Moon, At the full moon, on our festival day.
Psalm
81:4  For this is a law for Yisra’ĕl,
And a right-ruling of the Elohim of Ya‛aqoḇ.
Psalm
81:5  He appointed it in Yehosĕph
for a witness, When He went throughout the land of Mitsrayim; I heard a
language that I did not know.
Psalm
81:6  He
says, “I removed his shoulder from the burden; His hands were freed from
the baskets.
Psalm
81:7  “You called in distress, and I
rescued you; I answered you in the covering of thunder; I proved you at the
waters of Meriḇah. Selah.
Psalm
81:8  “Hear, O My people, and let Me warn
you, O Yisra’ĕl, if you would listen to Me!
Psalm
81:9  “Let there be no strange mighty one
among you, And do not bow down to a foreign mighty one.
Psalm
81:10  “I am יהוה
your Elohim, Who brought you out of the land of Mitsrayim; Open your mouth
wide, and I fill it.
Psalm
81:11  “But My people did not listen to
My voice, And Yisra’ĕl would not submit to Me.
Psalm
81:12  “So I gave them over to their own
stubborn heart, To walk in their own counsels.
Psalm
81:13  “O, if My people had listened to
Me, Yisra’ĕl would walk in My ways,
Psalm
81:14  “I would subdue their enemies at
once, And turn My hand against their adversaries!
Psalm
81:15  “Those who hate יהוה
would cringe before Him; And their time of
punishment be forever.
Psalm
81:16  “He would feed them with the
finest of wheat; And with honey from the rock I would satisfy you.”
Psalm
82:1  Elohim stands in the congregation
of Ĕl; He judges in the midst of the elohim.
Psalm
82:2  How long would you judge
perversely, And show partiality to the wrong? Selah.
Psalm
82:3  Give right-ruling to the poor and
fatherless, Do right to the afflicted and needy.
Psalm
82:4  Rescue the poor and needy; Deliver
them from the hand of the wrong.
Psalm
82:5  They do not know, nor do they
understand, They walk about in darkness. All the foundations of the earth are
shaken.
Psalm
82:6  I, I said, “You are elohim, And all
of you are sons of the Most High.
Psalm
82:7  “But as men you die, And fall as
one of the heads.”
Psalm
82:8  Arise, O Elohim, judge the earth,
For You shall possess all the nations.
Psalm
83:1  O Elohim, do not remain silent! Do
not be speechless, And do not be still, O Ĕl!
Psalm
83:2  For look, Your enemies make an
uproar, And those hating You have lifted up their head.
Psalm
83:3  They craftily plot against Your
people, And conspire against Your treasured ones.
Psalm
83:4  They have said, “Come, And let us
wipe them out as a nation, And let the name of Yisra’ĕl be remembered no
more.”
Psalm
83:5  For they have conspired together
with one heart; They have made a covenant against You –
Psalm
83:6  The tents of Eḏom and the
Yishma‛ĕlites, Mo’aḇ and the Haḡarites,
Psalm
83:7  Geḇal, and Ammon, and Amalĕq,
Philistia with the inhabitants of Tsor,
Psalm
83:8  Ashshur also has joined with them,
They have helped the children of Lot. Selah.
Psalm
83:9  Do to them as to Miḏyan, As
to Sisera, As to Yaḇin at the wadi Qishon,
Psalm
83:10  Who perished at Ĕndor, Who
became as dung for the ground.
Psalm
83:11  Make their nobles like Orĕḇ
and like Ze’ĕḇ, And all their princes like Zeḇaḥ and
Tsalmunna,
Psalm
83:12  Who have said, “Let us take
possession of the pastures of Elohim For ourselves.”
Psalm
83:13  O my Elohim, make them as whirling
dust, As stubble before the wind!
Psalm
83:14  As a fire consumes a forest, And
as a flame sets mountains on fire,
Psalm
83:15  So pursue them with Your
whirlwind, And frighten them with Your storm.
Psalm
83:16  Fill their faces with shame, And
let them seek Your Name, O יהוה.
Psalm
83:17  Let them be ashamed and alarmed
forever; And let them become abashed and perish,
Psalm
83:18  And let them know that You, Whose
Name is יהוה, You alone are the Most High over all the
earth.
Psalm
84:1  How lovely are Your dwelling
places, O יהוה of hosts!
Psalm
84:2  My being has longed, and even
fainted, For the courts of יהוה ; My heart and my flesh
cry out for the living Ĕl.
Psalm
84:3  Even the sparrow has found a home,
And the swallow a nest for herself, Where she has put her young ones – Your
altars, O יהוה of hosts, My Sovereign and my Elohim.
Psalm
84:4  Blessed are those who dwell in Your
house, They are ever praising You. Selah.
Psalm
84:5  Blessed is the man whose strength
is in You, Your Highways are in their
heart.
Psalm
84:6  Passing through the valley of
weeping, They make it a fountain; The Teacher also covers it with blessings.
Psalm
84:7  They go from strength to strength,
Appearing before Elohim in Tsiyon.
Psalm
84:8  O יהוה
Elohim of hosts, hear my prayer; Give ear, O Elohim of Ya‛aqoḇ!
Selah.
Psalm
84:9  O Elohim, see our shield, And look
upon the face of Your anointed.
Psalm
84:10  For a day in Your courts Is better
than a thousand days. I have chosen
rather to be a doorkeeper In the House of my Elohim, Than to dwell in the tents
of the wrong.
Psalm
84:11  For יהוה
Elohim is a sun and a shield; יהוה gives favour and
esteem; He withholds no good matter
From those who walk blamelessly.
Psalm
84:12  O יהוה of
hosts, Blessed is the man who trusts in You!
Psalm
85:1  יהוה, You
shall take pleasure in Your land; You shall turn back the captivity of Ya‛aqoḇ.
Psalm
85:2  You shall take away the crookedness
of Your people; You shall cover all their sin. Selah.
Psalm
85:3  You shall withdraw all Your wrath;
You shall turn from Your fierce displeasure.
Psalm
85:4  Turn back to us, O Elohim of our
deliverance, And cause Your vexation toward us to cease.
Psalm
85:5  Would You be enraged with us
forever? Would You draw out Your displeasure From generation to generation?
Psalm
85:6  Would You not revive us again, For
Your people to rejoice in You?
Psalm
85:7  Show us Your kindness, O יהוה,
And give us Your deliverance.
Psalm
85:8  Let me hear what Ĕl יהוה
speaks, For He speaks peace to His people And to His kind ones; And let them
not turn again to folly.
Psalm
85:9  Truly, His deliverance is near to
those who fear Him, For esteem to dwell in our land.
Psalm
85:10  Kindness and truth shall meet,
Righteousness and peace shall kiss.
Psalm
85:11  Truth sprouts forth from the
earth, And righteousness looks down from heaven,
Psalm
85:12  Indeed, יהוה
gives what is good, And our land yields its increase.
Psalm
85:13  Righteousness goes before Him, And
prepares a way for His footsteps.
Psalm
86:1  Incline Your ear, O יהוה,
Answer me, for I am poor and needy.
Psalm
86:2  Guard my being, for I am dedicated;
You are my Elohim; Save Your servant who is trusting in You!
Psalm
86:3  Show favour to me, O יהוה,
For I cry to You all day long.
Psalm
86:4  Bring joy to the being of Your
servant, For to You, O יהוה, I lift up my being.
Psalm
86:5  For You, יהוה,
are good, and ready to forgive, And great in kindness to all those who call
upon You.
Psalm
86:6  Give ear, O יהוה,
to my prayer; And listen to the voice of my pleadings.
Psalm
86:7  In the day of my distress I call
upon You, For You answer me.
Psalm
86:8  There is none like You among the
mighty ones, O יהוה ; And like Your works there are none.
Psalm
86:9  Let all nations You have made Come
and bow themselves before You, O יהוה, And give esteem
to Your Name.
Psalm
86:10  For You are great, and are doing
wonders; You are Elohim, You alone.
Psalm
86:11  Teach me Your way, O יהוה
; Let me walk in Your truth; Unite my heart to fear Your Name.
Psalm
86:12  I praise You, O יהוה
my Elohim, with all my heart, And I esteem Your Name forever.
Psalm
86:13  For Your kindness is great toward
me, And You have delivered my being From the depths of the grave.
Psalm
86:14  O Elohim, the proud have risen
against me, And a band of dreaded men have sought my life, And have not set You
before them.
Psalm
86:15  But You, O יהוה,
Are a compassionate Ĕl and showing favour, Patient and great in kindness
and truth.
Psalm
86:16  Turn to me, and show favour to me!
Give Your strength to Your servant, And save the son of Your female servant.
Psalm
86:17  Show me a sign for good, And let
those hating me see it and be ashamed, For You, יהוה,
have helped me and comforted me.
Psalm
87:1  His foundation is In the set-apart
mountains.
Psalm
87:2  יהוה loves
the gates of Tsiyon More than all the dwellings of Ya‛aqoḇ.
Psalm
87:3  Esteemed matters are spoken of you, O city of Elohim: Selah.
Psalm
87:4  “I mention Rahaḇ and Baḇel
to those who know Me; See, O Philistia and Tsor, with Kush, ‘This and that one
was born there.’ ”
Psalm
87:5  And of Tsiyon it is said, “Each one
was born in her; For the Most High Himself does establish her.”
Psalm
87:6  יהוה does
write, In the register of the peoples, “This one was born there.” Selah.
Psalm
87:7  And the singers and the players on
instruments – All my fountains, are in you.
Psalm
88:1  O יהוה,
Elohim of my deliverance, By day I have cried out, In the night also before You,
Psalm
88:2  Let my prayer come before You,
Incline Your ear to my cry.
Psalm
88:3  For my being is filled with evils,
And my life draws near to the grave.
Psalm
88:4  I have been reckoned among those
Who go down to the pit; I have become like a man Who has no strength,
Psalm
88:5  Released among the dead, Like slain
ones lying in the grave, Whom You have remembered no more, And who have been
cut off from Your hand.
Psalm
88:6  You have put me in the lowest pit,
In dark places, in the depths.
Psalm
88:7  Your wrath has rested heavily upon
me, And You have afflicted me with all Your breakers. Selah.
Psalm
88:8  You have put away my friends far
from me; You have made me an abomination to them; I am shut in and do not go
out;
Psalm
88:9  My eye grows dim because of
affliction. יהוה, I have called upon You, all day long;
I have stretched out my hands to You.
Psalm
88:10  Would You work wonders for the
dead? Would the dead rise to praise You? Selah.
Psalm
88:11  Is Your kindness declared in the
grave? Your trustworthiness in the place of destruction?
Psalm
88:12  Are Your wonders known in the
dark? And Your righteousness in the land of no remembrance?
Psalm
88:13  But I, unto You I have cried, O יהוה,
And in the morning my prayer comes before You.
Psalm
88:14  יהוה, why
do You reject me? Why do You hide Your face from me?
Psalm
88:15  I am afflicted and dying from
childhood; I have borne frightening matters
from You; I am in despair.
Psalm
88:16  Your fierce wrath has gone over
me; Your onslaughts have cut me off.
Psalm
88:17  They surrounded me like water all
day long; They close in upon me altogether.
Psalm
88:18  You have put loved one and
companion far from me, Darkness is my close friend!
Psalm
89:1  I sing of the kindnesses of יהוה
forever; With my mouth I make known Your trustworthiness To all generations.
Psalm
89:2  For I said, “Kindness is built up
forever; You establish Your trustworthiness in the heavens.”
Psalm
89:3  You
said, “I have made a covenant with My chosen, I have sworn to My servant
Dawiḏ:
Psalm
89:4  ‘I establish your seed forever, And
shall build up your throne to all generations.’ ” Selah.
Psalm
89:5  And the heavens praise Your
wonders, O יהוה, Your trustworthiness, too, In the
assembly of the set-apart ones.
Psalm
89:6  For who in the heavens is
comparable to יהוה ? Who among the sons of the mighty
is like יהוה ?
Psalm
89:7  Ĕl is greatly feared In the
company of the set-apart ones, And awesome above all those around Him.
Psalm
89:8  O יהוה
Elohim of hosts, Who is mighty like You, O Yah? And Your trustworthiness is all
around You.
Psalm
89:9  You rule the swelling of the sea;
When its waves rise, You still them.
Psalm
89:10  You have broken Rahaḇ in
pieces, as one who is slain; You have scattered Your enemies With the arm of
Your strength.
Psalm
89:11  The heavens are Yours, The earth
also is Yours; The world and all that fills it. You have founded them.
Psalm
89:12  North and south – You have created
them; Taḇor and Ḥermon rejoice in Your Name.
Psalm
89:13  You have a mighty arm, Your hand
is strong, Your right hand exalted.
Psalm
89:14  Righteousness and right-ruling Are
the foundation of Your throne; Kindness and truth go before Your face.
Psalm
89:15  Blessed are the people Who know
the festal trumpet-call! They walk, O
יהוה, in the light of Your face.
Psalm
89:16  In Your Name they rejoice all day
long, And they are exalted in Your righteousness .
Psalm
89:17  For You are the comeliness of
their strength, And by Your good pleasure our horn is exalted.
Psalm
89:18  For יהוה
is our shield, And the Set-apart One of Yisra’ĕl is our Sovereign.
Psalm
89:19  Then You spoke in a vision to Your
kind one, And You said, “I have given help to one who is mighty, I have exalted
one chosen from the people.
Psalm
89:20  “I have found My servant Dawiḏ;
With My set-apart oil I anointed him,
Psalm
89:21  “With whom My hand is established;
My arm also strengthens him.
Psalm
89:22  “No enemy subjects him to tribute,
And no son of wickedness afflicts him.
Psalm
89:23  “And I shall beat down His adversaries
before his face, And plague those who hate him.
Psalm
89:24  “But My trustworthiness And My
kindness are with him, And in My Name his horn is exalted.
Psalm
89:25  “And I shall set his hand on the
sea, And his right hand on the rivers.
Psalm
89:26  “He calls out to Me, ‘You are my
Father, My Ĕl, and the rock of my deliverance.’
Psalm
89:27  “I also appoint him first-born,
Highest of the sovereigns of the earth.
Psalm
89:28  “I guard My kindness for him
forever, And My covenant is steadfast with him.
Psalm
89:29  “And I shall establish his seed
forever, And his throne as the days of the heavens.
Psalm
89:30  “If his sons forsake My Torah And
do not walk in My right-rulings,
Psalm
89:31  “If they profane My laws And do
not guard My commands,
Psalm
89:32  “Then I shall visit their
transgression with the rod, And their crookedness with flogging.
Psalm
89:33  “But My kindness I do not take
away from him, Nor be false to My trustworthiness.
Psalm
89:34  “I shall not profane My covenant,
Neither would I change what has gone out from My lips.
Psalm
89:35  “Once I have sworn by My
set-apartness, I do not lie to Dawiḏ:
Psalm
89:36  “His seed shall be forever, And
his throne as the sun before Me;
Psalm
89:37  “Like the moon, it is established
forever, And the witness in the heaven is steadfast.” Selah.
Psalm
89:38  Yet You have rejected and spurned,
You have been wroth with Your anointed.
Psalm
89:39  You have disowned the covenant of
Your servant, You have defiled his diadem in the dust.
Psalm
89:40  You have broken down all his
hedges, You have brought his strongholds to ruin.
Psalm
89:41  All who pass by the way plunder
him; He is a reproach to his neighbours.
Psalm
89:42  You have exalted the right hand of
his adversaries, You have made all his enemies rejoice.
Psalm
89:43  Moreover You have turned back the
edge of his sword, And have not made him stand in battle.
Psalm
89:44  You have brought an end to his
splendour, And have hurled his throne to the ground.
Psalm
89:45  You have shortened the days of his
youth, You have covered him with shame. Selah.
Psalm
89:46  How long, O יהוה,
would You be hidden? Would Your wrath burn like fire forever?
Psalm
89:47  Please remember how short my time
is; Why should you have created all the sons of men for naught?
Psalm
89:48  What man would live and not see
death? Who rescues his life from the power of the grave? Selah.
Psalm
89:49  יהוה,
where are Your former kindnesses, Which You swore to Dawiḏ in Your
trustworthiness?
Psalm
89:50  יהוה,
remember the reproach of Your servants, That I have borne in my bosom – Of all
the many peoples,
Psalm
89:51  With which Your enemies have
reproached, O יהוה, With which they have reproached the
footsteps of Your anointed.
Psalm
89:52  Blessed be יהוה
forever! Amĕn and Amĕn.
Psalm
90:1  יהוה, You
have been our refuge In all generations.
Psalm
90:2  Before the mountains were born, Or
You had brought forth the earth and the world, Even from everlasting to
everlasting You are Ĕl.
Psalm
90:3  You turn man back to dust, And say,
“Return, O children of men.”
Psalm
90:4  For a thousand years in Your eyes
Are like yesterday that has past, Or like a watch in the night.
Psalm
90:5  You have swept them away, They are
as a sleep, Like grass that springs up in the morning.
Psalm
90:6  At evening it is cut down and
withered.
Psalm
90:7  For we have been consumed by Your
displeasure, And by Your wrath we are alarmed.
Psalm
90:8  You have set our crookednesses
before You, Our secret sin in the
light of Your face.
Psalm
90:9  For all our days have passed away
in Your wrath, We spend our years like a whisper.
Psalm
90:10  The days of our lives are seventy
years; Or if due to strength, eighty years, Yet the best of them is but toil
and exertion; For it is soon cut off, and we fly away.
Psalm
90:11  Who knows the power of Your
displeasure? And your wrath, according to the fear of You?
Psalm
90:12  Teach us to number our days, And
let us bring the heart to wisdom.
Psalm
90:13  Return, O יהוה
! How long? And be sorry for Your servants.
Psalm
90:14  Satisfy us in the morning with
Your kindness, And let us sing for joy all our days!
Psalm
90:15  Give us joy according to The days
You have afflicted us, The years we have seen evil.
Psalm
90:16  Reveal Your work to Your servants,
And Your splendour to their children.
Psalm
90:17  And let the pleasantness Of יהוה
our Elohim be upon us, And confirm the work of our hands for us; O confirm the
work of our hands!
Psalm
91:1  He who dwells in the secret place
of the Most High, Who abides under the shadow of the Almighty,
Psalm
91:2  He is saying of יהוה,
“My refuge and my stronghold, My Elohim, in whom I trust!”
Psalm
91:3  For He delivers you from the snare
of a trapper, From the destructive pestilence.
Psalm
91:4  He covers you with His feathers,
And under His wings you take refuge; His truth is a shield and armour.
Psalm
91:5  You are not afraid of the dread by
night, Of the arrow that flies by day,
Psalm
91:6  Of the pestilence that walks in
darkness, Of destruction that ravages at midday.
Psalm
91:7  A thousand fall at your side, And
ten thousand at your right hand; But it does not come near you.
Psalm
91:8  Only with your eyes you look on,
And see the reward of the wrong ones.
Psalm
91:9  Because you have made יהוה
– My refuge, the Most High – your dwelling place,
Psalm
91:10  No evil befalls you, And a plague
does not come near your tent;
Psalm
91:11  For He commands His messengers
concerning you, To guard you in all your ways.
Psalm
91:12  They bear you up in their hands,
Lest you dash your foot against a stone.
Psalm
91:13  You tread upon lion and cobra,
Young lion and serpent you trample under foot.
Psalm
91:14  “Because he cleaves to Me in love,
Therefore I deliver him; I set him on high, Because he has known My Name.
Psalm
91:15  “When he calls on Me, I answer
him; I am with him in distress; I deliver him and esteem him.
Psalm
91:16  “With long life I satisfy him, And
show him My deliverance.”
Psalm
92:1  It is good to give thanks to יהוה,
And to sing praises to Your Name, O Most High;
Psalm
92:2  To declare Your kindness in the
morning, And Your trustworthiness each night,
Psalm
92:3  On ten strings, and on the harp, To
the sounding chords of the lyre.
Psalm
92:4  For You have made me rejoice with
Your work, O יהוה, I shout for joy at the works of Your
hands.
Psalm
92:5  O יהוה, how
great are Your works! Your thoughts are very deep!
Psalm
92:6  A senseless man does not know, And
a fool does not understand this.
Psalm
92:7  When the wrong spring up like
grass, And all the workers of wickedness blossom, It is for them to be
destroyed forever.
Psalm
92:8  But You, יהוה,
are on high forever. 
Psalm
92:9  For look, Your enemies, O יהוה,
For look, Your enemies do perish; All the workers of wickedness are scattered.
Psalm
92:10  But You lift up my horn like a
wild ox; I have been anointed with fresh oil.
Psalm
92:11  And my eye looks upon my enemies;
My ears hear the evil-doers Who rise up against me.
Psalm
92:12  The righteous one flourishes like
a palm tree, He grows like a cedar in Leḇanon.
Psalm
92:13  Those who are planted in the House
of יהוה Flourish in the courts of our Elohim.
Psalm
92:14  They still bear fruit in old age;
They are fresh and green,
Psalm
92:15  To declare that יהוה
is straight, My rock, and in Him is no unrighteousness.
Psalm
93:1  יהוה shall
reign, He shall put on excellency; יהוה shall put on
strength; He shall gird Himself. Indeed, the world is established, immovable.
Psalm
93:2  Your throne is established from of
old; You are from everlasting.
Psalm
93:3  Rivers shall lift up, O יהוה,
Rivers shall lift up their voice; Rivers lift up their breakers.
Psalm
93:4  יהוה on
high is mightier Than the noise of many waters, The mighty breakers of the sea.
Psalm
93:5  Your witnesses have been very
trustworthy. Set-apartness befits Your house, O יהוה,
forever.
Psalm
94:1  O יהוה, Ĕl
of vengeance; O Ĕl of vengeance, shine forth!
Psalm
94:2  Raise Yourself up, O Judge of the
earth; Render punishment to the proud.
Psalm
94:3  יהוה, how
long are the wrong, How long are the wrong going to exult?
Psalm
94:4  They pour forth words, They speak arrogantly; All the
workers of wickedness boast in themselves.
Psalm
94:5  They crush Your people, O יהוה,
And they afflict Your inheritance.
Psalm
94:6  They slay the widow and the
stranger, And murder the fatherless.
Psalm
94:7  Yet they say, “Yah does not see,
And the Elohim of Ya‛aqoḇ pays no heed.”
Psalm
94:8  Take heed, you senseless among the
people; And you fools, when would you become wise?
Psalm
94:9  He who planted the ear, does He not
hear? He who formed the eye, does He not see?
Psalm
94:10  He who disciplines the nations,
Does He not reprove – The One teaching man knowledge?
Psalm
94:11  יהוה knows
the thoughts of man, That they are but
a breath.
Psalm
94:12  Blessed is the man You discipline,
O Yah, And instruct out of Your Torah,
Psalm
94:13  To give him rest from the days of
evil, Until the pit is dug for the wrong.
Psalm
94:14  For יהוה
does not leave His people, Nor does He forsake His inheritance.
Psalm
94:15  For right-ruling returns man to righteousness, And all the
upright in heart follow it.
Psalm
94:16  Who would rise up for me against
evil-doers? Who would stand up for me against workers of wickedness?
Psalm
94:17  If יהוה
had not been my help, My being would soon have settled in silence.
Psalm
94:18  When I said, “My foot has slipped,”
Your kindness, O יהוה, supported me.
Psalm
94:19  When anxiety was great within me,
Your comforts delighted my being.
Psalm
94:20  Would a throne of destruction,
Which devises trouble by decree, Be joined with You?
Psalm
94:21  They band together against the
life of the righteous, And declare innocent blood wrong.
Psalm
94:22  But יהוה
is my defence, And my Elohim the rock of my refuge,
Psalm
94:23  And brings back on them their own
wickedness, And cuts them off in their own wrongdoing; יהוה
our Elohim does cut them off.
Psalm
95:1  Come, let us sing to יהוה
! Let us raise a shout to the Rock of our deliverance.
Psalm
95:2  Let us come before His face with
thanksgiving; Let us raise a shout to Him in song.
Psalm
95:3  For יהוה is
a great Ĕl, And a great Sovereign above all mighty ones.
Psalm
95:4  In whose hand are the depths of the
earth; The mountain peaks are His also.
Psalm
95:5  His is the sea, for He made it; And
His hands formed the dry land.
Psalm
95:6  Come, let us bow down and bend low,
Let us kneel before יהוה our Maker.
Psalm
95:7  For He is our Elohim, And we are
the people of His pasture, And the sheep of His hand. Today, if you would hear
His voice:
Psalm
95:8  “Do not harden your hearts as in
Meriḇah, And as in the day of Massah in the wilderness,
Psalm
95:9  “When your fathers tried Me, Have
proved Me, though they saw My work.
Psalm
95:10  “For forty years I was grieved
with that generation, And said, ‘They
are a people who go astray in their hearts, And they do not know My ways.’
Psalm
95:11  “As I swore in My wrath, ‘If they
enter into My rest...’ ” 
Psalm
96:1  Sing to יהוה
a new song, Sing to יהוה, all the earth!
Psalm
96:2  Sing to יהוה,
bless His Name, Proclaim His deliverance from day to day.
Psalm
96:3  Declare His esteem among the
nations, His wonders among all peoples.
Psalm
96:4  For great is יהוה
and greatly to be praised, He is to be feared above all mighty ones.
Psalm
96:5  For all the mighty ones of the
peoples are matters of naught, But יהוה made the
heavens.
Psalm
96:6  Excellency and splendour are before
Him, Strength and comeliness are in His set-apart place.
Psalm
96:7  Ascribe to יהוה,
O clans of the peoples, Ascribe to יהוה esteem and
strength.
Psalm
96:8  Ascribe to יהוה
the esteem of His Name; Bring an offering, and come into His courts.
Psalm
96:9  Bow yourselves to יהוה,
In the splendour of set-apartness! Tremble before Him, all the earth.
Psalm
96:10  Say among nations, “ יהוה
shall reign. The world also is established, immovable. He judges the peoples in
straightness.”
Psalm
96:11  Let the heavens rejoice, and let
the earth be glad; Let the sea roar, and all that fills it;
Psalm
96:12  Let the field exult, and all that
is in it. Let all the trees of the forest then shout for joy,
Psalm
96:13  At the presence of יהוה.
For He shall come, For He shall come to judge the earth. He judges the world in
righteousness, And the peoples with His truth.
Psalm
97:1  יהוה shall
reign. The earth rejoices. Many isles are glad!
Psalm
97:2  Clouds and darkness all around Him,
Righteousness and right-ruling are the foundation of His throne.
Psalm
97:3  Fire goes before Him, And burns up
His adversaries round about.
Psalm
97:4  His lightnings shall light the
world, The earth shall see and tremble.
Psalm
97:5  The mountains shall melt like wax
before the face of יהוה, Before the face of the Master
of all the earth.
Psalm
97:6  The heavens shall declare His righteousness,
And all the peoples shall see His esteem.
Psalm
97:7  All are put to shame who serve
carved images, Those boasting of matters of naught. Bow yourselves to Him, all
you mighty ones.
Psalm
97:8  Tsiyon shall hear and be glad, And
the daughters of Yehuḏah rejoice Because of Your right-rulings, O יהוה.
Psalm
97:9  For You, יהוה,
are the Most High over all the earth, You shall be greatly exalted, over all
mighty ones.
Psalm
97:10  You who love יהוה,
hate evil! He guards the lives of His kind ones, He delivers them out of the
hand of the wrong.
Psalm
97:11  Light is sown for the righteous,
And gladness for the upright in heart.
Psalm
97:12  Rejoice in יהוה,
you righteous, And give thanks at the remembrance of His Set-apartness.
Psalm
98:1  Sing to יהוה
a new song! For He has done wonders; His right hand and His set-apart arm Have
brought Him deliverance.
Psalm
98:2  יהוה has
made known His deliverance; His righteousness He has openly shown Before the
eyes of the nations.
Psalm
98:3  He has remembered His kindness And
His trustworthiness to the house of Yisra’ĕl; All the ends of the earth
have seen The deliverance of our Elohim.
Psalm
98:4  Raise a shout to יהוה,
all the earth; Break forth in song, rejoice, and sing praises.
Psalm
98:5  Sing to יהוה
with the lyre, With the lyre and the voice of a song,
Psalm
98:6  With trumpets and the sound of a
horn; Raise a shout before יהוה, the Sovereign.
Psalm
98:7  Let the sea roar, and all that
fills it, The world and those who dwell in it.
Psalm
98:8  Let the rivers clap their hands,
Let the mountains sing together for joy before יהוה,
Psalm
98:9  For He shall come to judge the
earth. He judges the world in righteousness, And the people in straightness.
Psalm
99:1  יהוה shall
reign; Peoples tremble! He is enthroned on the keruḇim; The earth shakes!
Psalm
99:2  יהוה is
great in Tsiyon, And He is high above all the peoples.
Psalm
99:3  They praise Your Name, great and
awesome, It is set-apart.
Psalm
99:4  And the strength of the Sovereign
Shall love right-ruling; You Yourself shall establish straightness; You shall
execute right-ruling And righteousness in Ya‛aqoḇ.
Psalm
99:5  Exalt יהוה
our Elohim, And bow yourselves at His footstool, He is set-apart.
Psalm
99:6  Mosheh and Aharon were among His
priests, And Shemu’ĕl was among those calling upon His Name. They called
upon יהוה, and He answered them.
Psalm
99:7  He spoke to them in the column of
cloud; They guarded His witnesses And the law He gave them.
Psalm
99:8  You answered them, O יהוה
our Elohim. You were a forgiving Ĕl to them, Though You took vengeance on
their deeds.
Psalm
99:9  Exalt יהוה
our Elohim, And bow down towards His set-apart mountain; For יהוה
our Elohim is set-apart.
Psalm
100:1  Raise a shout for יהוה,
All the earth!
Psalm
100:2  Serve יהוה
with gladness; Come before His presence with singing.
Psalm
100:3  Know that יהוה,
He is Elohim; He has made us, and we are His – His people and the sheep of His
pasture.
Psalm
100:4  Enter into His gates with
thanksgiving, And into His courts with praise. Give thanks to Him; bless His
Name.
Psalm
100:5  For יהוה
is good; His kindness is everlasting, And His truth, to all generations.
Psalm
101:1  I sing of kindness and
right-ruling; To You, O יהוה, I sing praises.
Psalm
101:2  I act wisely in a perfect way.
When do You come to me? I walk in the midst of my house with a perfect heart.
Psalm
101:3  I set no matter of Beliya‛al
before my eyes; I hate the work of those who fall away; It does not cleave to
me.
Psalm
101:4  A perverse heart turns away from
me; I do not know evil.
Psalm
101:5  Him who secretly slanders his
neighbour I cut off; I do not tolerate one Who has a haughty look and a proud
heart.
Psalm
101:6  My eyes are on the trustworthy of
the land, To dwell with me; He who walks in a perfect way, He serves me.
Psalm
101:7  He who practises deceit Does not
dwell in my house; He who speaks lies Does not stand in my presence.
Psalm
101:8  Each morning I uproot all the
wrong of the land, To cut off all the workers of wickedness From the city of יהוה.
Psalm
102:1  O יהוה,
hear my prayer, And let my cry come to You.
Psalm
102:2  Do not hide Your face from me In
the day of my distress; Incline Your ear to me; In the day I call, answer me
speedily.
Psalm
102:3  For my days are consumed like
smoke, And my bones are burned like a hearth.
Psalm
102:4  My heart is stricken and withered
like grass, For I have forgotten to eat my bread.
Psalm
102:5  Because of the sound of my sighing
My bones have cleaved to my flesh.
Psalm
102:6  I have been like a pelican of the
wilderness, I have been like an owl of the desert.
Psalm
102:7  I have watched, and I am As a bird
alone on the house-top.
Psalm
102:8  My enemies reproached me all day
long, Those who rave against me have sworn against me.
Psalm
102:9  For I have eaten ashes like bread,
And mixed my drink with tears,
Psalm
102:10  Because of Your displeasure and
Your wrath; For You have lifted me up And thrown me down.
Psalm
102:11  My days are like a shadow that
lengthens, And I wither away like grass.
Psalm
102:12  But You, O יהוה,
shall be enthroned forever, And the remembrance of You be to all generations.
Psalm
102:13  You Yourself shall arise And have
compassion on Tsiyon, For the time to favour her, The appointed time, has come.
Psalm
102:14  For Your servants have been
pleased with her stones, And they favour her dust.
Psalm
102:15  And the nations shall fear the
Name of יהוה, And all the sovereigns of the earth Your
esteem,
Psalm
102:16  For יהוה
shall build up Tsiyon, He shall appear in His esteem.
Psalm
102:17  He shall turn unto the prayer of
the destitute, And He shall not despise their prayer.
Psalm
102:18  This is written for a generation
to come, So that a people to be created praise Yah.
Psalm
102:19  For He looked down From the
height of His set-apart place; From heaven יהוה viewed
the earth,
Psalm
102:20  To hear the groaning of the
prisoner, To release those appointed to death,
Psalm
102:21  To declare the Name of יהוה
in Tsiyon, And His praise in Yerushalayim,
Psalm
102:22  When peoples gather together, And
reigns, to serve יהוה.
Psalm
102:23  He has humbled my strength in the
way; He has shortened my days.
Psalm
102:24  I said, “O my Ĕl, Do not
take me away in the midst of my days; Your years are throughout all
generations.
Psalm
102:25  “You did found the earth of old,
And the heavens are the work of Your hands.
Psalm
102:26  “They shall perish, but You
remain; And all of them grow old like a garment; You change them like a coat,
And they are changed.
Psalm
102:27  “But You are the same, And Your
years have no end.
Psalm
102:28  “The sons of Your servants
continue, And their seed is established before You.”
Psalm
103:1  Bless יהוה,
O my being, And all that is within me, Bless
His set-apart Name!
Psalm
103:2  Bless יהוה,
O my being, And do not forget all His dealings,
Psalm
103:3  Who forgives all your
crookednesses, Who heals all your diseases,
Psalm
103:4  Who redeems your life from
destruction, Who crowns you with kindness and compassion,
Psalm
103:5  Who satisfies your desire with the
good, Your youth is renewed like the eagle’s.
Psalm
103:6  יהוה is
doing righteousness And right-ruling for all the oppressed.
Psalm
103:7  He made known His ways to Mosheh,
His acts to the children of Yisra’ĕl.
Psalm
103:8  יהוה is
compassionate and showing favour, Patient, and great in kindness.
Psalm
103:9  He does not always strive, nor
maintain it forever. 
Psalm
103:10  He has not done to us according
to our sins, Nor rewarded us according to our crookednesses.
Psalm
103:11  For as the heavens are high above
the earth, So great is His kindness toward those who fear Him;
Psalm
103:12  As far as east is from west, So
far has He removed our transgressions from us.
Psalm
103:13  As a father has compassion for
his children, So יהוה has compassion for those who fear
Him.
Psalm
103:14  For He knows how we are made; He
remembers that we are dust.
Psalm
103:15  As a flower of the field, so he
flourishes.
Psalm
103:16  For the wind blows over it, and
it is no more, And its place no longer remembers it.
Psalm
103:17  But the kindness of יהוה
Is from everlasting to everlasting Upon those who fear Him, And His
righteousness to children’s children,
Psalm
103:18  To those who guard His covenant,
And to those who remember His orders to do them.
Psalm
103:19  יהוה has
established His throne in the heavens, And His reign shall rule over all.
Psalm
103:20  Bless יהוה,
you His messengers, Mighty in power, who do His Word, Listening to the voice of
His Word.
Psalm
103:21  Bless יהוה,
all you His hosts, You His servants, who do His pleasure.
Psalm
103:22  Bless יהוה,
all His works, In all places of His rule. Bless יהוה, O
my being!
Psalm
104:1  Bless יהוה,
O my being! O יהוה my Elohim, You have been very great:
You have put on excellency and splendour,
Psalm
104:2  Covering Yourself with light as
with a garment, Stretching out the heavens like a curtain,
Psalm
104:3  Who is laying the beams of His
upper rooms in the waters, Who is making thick clouds His chariot, Who is
walking on the wings of the wind,
Psalm
104:4  Making His messengers the winds,
His servants a flame of fire.
Psalm
104:5  He established the earth on its
foundations, So that it would not totter forever,
Psalm
104:6  You covered it with the deep as
with a garment; The waters stood above the mountains.
Psalm
104:7  At Your rebuke they flee; At the
voice of Your thunder they hurry away.
Psalm
104:8  They go up the mountains; They go
down the valleys, To the place which You founded for them.
Psalm
104:9  You did set a boundary, they do
not pass over, They do not return to cover the earth.
Psalm
104:10  Who is sending the springs into
the valleys, They flow among the hills.
Psalm
104:11  They give drink to every beast of
the field; Wild donkeys break their thirst.
Psalm
104:12  The birds of the heavens dwell beside
them; They sing from between the branches.
Psalm
104:13  Watering the hills from His upper
rooms; The earth is satisfied with the fruit of Your works.
Psalm
104:14  Causing the grass to grow for the
cattle, And plants for the service of mankind, To bring forth food from the
earth,
Psalm
104:15  And wine that makes glad the
heart of man, Oil to make the face shine, And bread which sustains man’s heart.
Psalm
104:16  The trees of יהוה
are satisfied, The cedars of Leḇanon which He planted,
Psalm
104:17  Where the birds do make nests;
The stork has her home in the fir trees.
Psalm
104:18  The high hills are for wild
goats; Rocks a refuge for rock badgers.
Psalm
104:19  He made the moon for appointed
times; The sun knows its going down.
Psalm
104:20  You put darkness, and it is
night, In it all the beasts of the forest creep.
Psalm
104:21  The young lions are roaring for
prey, And seeking their food from Ĕl.
Psalm
104:22  The sun arises – they withdraw
And lie down in their dens.
Psalm
104:23  Man goes out to his work, And to
his labour, till evening.
Psalm
104:24  O יהוה,
how many have been Your works! You have made all of them in wisdom. The earth
is filled with Your possessions.
Psalm
104:25  There is the sea, great and wide,
In which are innumerable swarms, Living creatures, small with great.
Psalm
104:26  There do ships go; That Liwiathan
which You made, to play there.
Psalm
104:27  All of them wait for You, To give
their food in due season.
Psalm
104:28  You give to them, they gather in;
You open Your hand, they are satisfied with good.
Psalm
104:29  You hide Your face, they are
alarmed; You take away their breath, they die and return to their dust;
Psalm
104:30  You send forth Your Spirit, they
are created; And You renew the face of the earth.
Psalm
104:31  The esteem of יהוה
is forever, יהוה rejoices in His works,
Psalm
104:32  Who looks on the earth, and it
trembles; He touches the mountains, and they smoke.
Psalm
104:33  I sing to יהוה
as long as I live, I sing praise to my Elohim while I exist.
Psalm
104:34  My meditation on Him is sweet; I
rejoice in יהוה.
Psalm
104:35  Let sinners be consumed from the
earth, And let the wrong be no more. Bless יהוה, O my
being! Praise Yah!
Psalm
105:1  Give thanks to יהוה
! Call upon His Name, Make known His deeds among the peoples.
Psalm
105:2  Sing to Him, sing praise to Him;
Speak of all His wonders.
Psalm
105:3  Make your boast in His set-apart
Name; Let the hearts rejoice of those seeking יהוה.
Psalm
105:4  Seek יהוה
and His strength; Seek His face always.
Psalm
105:5  Remember His wonders which He has
done, His miracles, and the right-rulings of His mouth,
Psalm
105:6  O seed of Aḇraham His
servant, Children of Ya‛aqoḇ, His chosen ones!
Psalm
105:7  He is יהוה
our Elohim; His right-rulings are in all the earth.
Psalm
105:8  He has remembered His covenant
forever, The Word He commanded, for a thousand generations,
Psalm
105:9  The covenant He made with Aḇraham, And His oath to
Yitsḥaq,
Psalm
105:10  And established it to Ya‛aqoḇ
for a law, To Yisra’ĕl – an everlasting covenant,
Psalm
105:11  Saying, “To you I give the land
of Kena‛an, The portion of your inheritance.”
Psalm
105:12  When they were few in number, Few
indeed, and sojourners in it,
Psalm
105:13  And they went about from one
nation to another, From one reign to another people,
Psalm
105:14  He allowed no one to oppress
them, And He reproved sovereigns for their sakes,
Psalm
105:15  Saying, “Do not touch My anointed ones, And do My prophets no evil.”
Psalm
105:16  And He called for a scarcity of
food in the land; He cut off all the supply of bread.
Psalm
105:17  He sent ahead of them a man, Yosĕph,
sold as a slave.
Psalm
105:18  They afflicted his feet with
shackles, His neck was put in irons.
Psalm
105:19  Until the time that His Word
came, The Word of יהוה tried him.
Psalm
105:20  The sovereign sent and released
him, The ruler of the people let him loose.
Psalm
105:21  He made him master of his house,
And ruler over all his possessions,
Psalm
105:22  To bind his chiefs at his
pleasure, And to teach his elders wisdom.
Psalm
105:23  Then Yisra’ĕl came to
Mitsrayim, And Ya‛aqoḇ sojourned in the land of Ḥam.
Psalm
105:24  And He increased His people
greatly, And made them stronger than their enemies.
Psalm
105:25  He turned their heart to hate His
people, To conspire against His servants.
Psalm
105:26  He sent Mosheh His servant,
Aharon whom He had chosen.
Psalm
105:27  They set among them the matters
of His signs, And wonders in the land of Ḥam.
Psalm
105:28  He sent darkness, and made it
dark; And they did not rebel against His word.
Psalm
105:29  He turned their waters into
blood, And killed their fish.
Psalm
105:30  Their land teemed with frogs, In
the rooms of their sovereigns.
Psalm
105:31  He spoke, and swarms of flies
came, Gnats in all their borders.
Psalm
105:32  He gave them hail for rain, A
flaming fire in their land.
Psalm
105:33  And He smote their vines and
their fig trees, And broke the trees of their borders.
Psalm
105:34  He spoke, and locusts came, And larvae,
innumerable,
Psalm
105:35  And they devoured all the plants
in their land, And they devoured the fruit of their ground.
Psalm
105:36  Then He smote all the first-born
in their land, The first-fruit of all their strength,
Psalm
105:37  And brought them out with silver
and gold, And among His tribes no one faltered.
Psalm
105:38  Mitsrayim was glad when they
left, For the fear of them had fallen upon them.
Psalm
105:39  He spread a cloud for a covering,
And fire to give light in the night.
Psalm
105:40  They asked, and He brought quail,
And satisfied them with the bread of heaven.
Psalm
105:41  He opened the rock, and water
gushed out; It ran in the dry places, a river.
Psalm
105:42  For He remembered His set-apart
word, To Aḇraham His servant.
Psalm
105:43  So He brought out His people with
joy, His chosen ones with singing.
Psalm
105:44  And He gave to them the lands of
the gentiles, And they inherited the labour of peoples,
Psalm
105:45  In order that they might guard
His laws, And watch over His Torot. Praise Yah!
Psalm
106:1  Praise Yah! Oh, give thanks to יהוה,
For He is good! For His kindness is everlasting.
Psalm
106:2  Who does relate the mighty acts of
יהוה ? Or declare all His praise?
Psalm
106:3  Blessed are those who guard
right-ruling, Who do righteousness at all times!
Psalm
106:4  Remember me, O יהוה,
in the acceptance of Your people; Visit me with Your deliverance,
Psalm
106:5  To see the good of Your chosen
ones, To rejoice in the gladness of Your nation, To make my boast with Your
inheritance.
Psalm
106:6  We have sinned with our fathers,
We have acted perversely, We have done wrong.
Psalm
106:7  Our fathers in Mitsrayim did not
understand Your wonders; They did not remember Your many kindnesses, But
rebelled by the sea, the Sea of Reeds.
Psalm
106:8  But He saved them for His Name’s
sake, To make known His might.
Psalm
106:9  And He rebuked the Sea of Reeds,
and it dried up; And He led them through the depths, Through a wilderness.
Psalm
106:10  And He saved them from the hand
of the hater, And redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
Psalm
106:11  And waters covered their
adversaries; Not one of them was left.
Psalm
106:12  Then they believed His words;
They sang His praise.
Psalm
106:13  They soon forgot His works; They
did not wait for His counsel,
Psalm
106:14  But greedily lusted in the
wilderness, And tried Ĕl in the desert.
Psalm
106:15  And He gave them their request,
But sent leanness within their being.
Psalm
106:16  And they were jealous of Mosheh
in the camp, Of Aharon, the set-apart one of יהוה,
Psalm
106:17  Then the earth opened up and swallowed Dathan, And covered the
company of Aḇiram.
Psalm
106:18  And a fire burned in their
company; A flame consumed the wrong.
Psalm
106:19  They made a calf in Ḥorĕḇ,
And bowed down to a moulded image.
Psalm
106:20  Thus they changed My esteem Into
the form of an ox that eats grass.
Psalm
106:21  They forgot Ĕl their
Saviour, The Doer of great deeds in
Mitsrayim,
Psalm
106:22  Of wonders in the land of Ḥam,
Of awesome deeds by the Sea of Reeds.
Psalm
106:23  Then He said that He would
destroy them, Had not Mosheh His chosen one stood before Him in the breach, To
turn away His wrath from destroying them.
Psalm
106:24  They then despised the pleasant
land; They did not believe His word,
Psalm
106:25  And they grumbled in their tents,
They did not listen to the voice of יהוה.
Psalm
106:26  So He lifted up His hand in an oath against them, To make them
fall in the wilderness,
Psalm
106:27  And to make their seed fall among
the gentiles, And to scatter them in the lands.
Psalm
106:28  And they joined themselves to Ba‛al
Pe‛or, And ate slaughterings made to the dead.
Psalm
106:29  Thus they provoked Him with their
deeds, And the plague broke out among them.
Psalm
106:30  Then Pineḥas stood up and
intervened, And the plague was stopped.
Psalm
106:31  And that was reckoned to him for
righteousness To all generations forever.
Psalm
106:32  And they provoked wrath at the
waters of Meriḇah, And Mosheh suffered on account of them;
Psalm
106:33  Because they embittered his
spirit, And he spoke rashly with his lips.
Psalm
106:34  They did not destroy the peoples,
As יהוה had commanded them,
Psalm
106:35  But mixed with the gentiles And
learned their works,
Psalm
106:36  And served their idols, And they
became a snare to them.
Psalm
106:37  And they slaughtered their sons
And their daughters to demons,
Psalm
106:38  And they shed innocent blood, The
blood of their sons and daughters, Whom they offered to the idols of Kena‛an;
And the land was defiled with blood.
Psalm
106:39  So they became unclean by their
own works, And went whoring by their own deeds.
Psalm
106:40  And the wrath of יהוה
burned against His people, And He loathed His own inheritance.
Psalm
106:41  Then He gave them into the hand
of the gentiles, And those who hated them ruled over them.
Psalm
106:42  And their enemies oppressed them,
And they were humbled under their hand.
Psalm
106:43  Many times He delivered them; But
they rebelled in their plans, So they were brought low for their crookedness.
Psalm
106:44  But He would look on their
distress, When He heard their cry,
Psalm
106:45  And remember His covenant for
their sake, And relent according to the greatness of His kindness.
Psalm
106:46  And He would let them find
compassion, Before all those holding them captive.
Psalm
106:47  Save us, O יהוה
our Elohim, And gather us from among the gentiles, To give thanks to Your
set-apart Name, To exult in Your praise.
Psalm
106:48  Blessed be יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl From everlasting to everlasting! And all the people
shall say, “Amĕn!” Praise Yah!
Psalm
107:1  Give thanks to יהוה
! For He is good, For His kindness is
everlasting.
Psalm
107:2  Let the redeemed of יהוה
say so, Whom He has redeemed from the
hand of the adversary,
Psalm
107:3  And gathered out of the lands,
From east and from west, From north and from south.
Psalm
107:4  They wandered in a wilderness, in
a desert way; They found no city to dwell in.
Psalm
107:5  Hungry and thirsty, Their being in
them grew faint.
Psalm
107:6  Then they cried out to יהוה
in their distress, He delivered them out of their troubles.
Psalm
107:7  And He guided them by the right
way, To go to a city to settle.
Psalm
107:8  Let them give thanks to יהוה
for His kindness, And His wonders to the children of men!
Psalm
107:9  For He has satisfied a longing
being, And has filled the hungry being with goodness.
Psalm
107:10  Some sat in darkness and in the
shadow of death, Bound in affliction and irons,
Psalm
107:11  Because they rebelled against the
words of Ĕl, And despised the counsel of the Most High.
Psalm
107:12  And He humbled their heart by
toil; They stumbled, and there was no one to help.
Psalm
107:13  And they cried out to יהוה
in their distress, And He saved them out of their troubles.
Psalm
107:14  He brought them out of darkness
and the shadow of death, And He broke their chains in pieces.
Psalm
107:15  Let them give thanks to יהוה
for His kindness, And His wonders to the children of men!
Psalm
107:16  For He has broken the gates of
bronze, And He cut the bars of iron in two.
Psalm
107:17  Fools, because of their
transgression, And because of their crookednesses, were afflicted.
Psalm
107:18  Their being loathed all food, And
they drew near to the gates of death,
Psalm
107:19  And cried out to יהוה
in their distress, He saved them out of their troubles.
Psalm
107:20  He sent His word and healed them,
And delivered them from their destructions.
Psalm
107:21  Let them give thanks to יהוה
for His kindness, And His wonders to the children of men!
Psalm
107:22  And let them bring slaughterings
of thanksgiving, And relate His works with rejoicing.
Psalm
107:23  Those who go down to the sea in
ships, Doing work in many waters,
Psalm
107:24  They see the works of יהוה,
And His wonders in the deep.
Psalm
107:25  For He commands and raises the
stormy wind, Which lifts up the waves of the sea.
Psalm
107:26  They go up to the heavens, They
go down to the depths; Their being is melted because of evil.
Psalm
107:27  They reel to and fro, and stagger
like a drunkard, And all their wisdom is swallowed up.
Psalm
107:28  Then they cry out to יהוה
in their distress, And He brings them out of their troubles.
Psalm
107:29  He caused the storm to be still,
So that its waves were silent.
Psalm
107:30  And they rejoice because they are
hushed; And He leads them to the haven of their delight.
Psalm
107:31  Let them give thanks to יהוה
for His kindness, And His wonders to the children of men!
Psalm
107:32  And let them exalt Him in the
assembly of the people, And praise Him in the seat of the elders.
Psalm
107:33  He makes rivers become a
wilderness, And the fountains of water become a dry ground;
Psalm
107:34  A land of fruit becomes a salty
desert, For the evil of those who dwell in it.
Psalm
107:35  He makes a wilderness become a
pool of water, And dry land become fountains of waters.
Psalm
107:36  And He causes the hungry to dwell
there, And they build a city to settle in,
Psalm
107:37  And they sow fields and plant
vineyards, And they make fruits of increase.
Psalm
107:38  And He blesses them, And they
increase greatly; And He lets not their cattle diminish.
Psalm
107:39  But when they are diminished and
brought low Through oppression, evil and sorrow,
Psalm
107:40  He pours scorn on nobles, And
causes them to wander in a pathless waste;
Psalm
107:41  But He raises the poor up from
affliction, And makes their clans
like a flock.
Psalm
107:42  The straight ones see, and
rejoice, And all unrighteousness shuts its mouth.
Psalm
107:43  Who is wise? Then let him observe
these matters! Let them understand
the kindnesses of יהוה.
Psalm
108:1  O Elohim, my heart is steadfast; I
sing and give praise – even my esteem.
Psalm
108:2  Awake, harp and lyre! I awake the
dawn.
Psalm
108:3  I praise You, O יהוה,
among peoples, And I sing praises to You among the nations.
Psalm
108:4  For Your kindness is great above
the heavens, And Your truth reaches to the clouds.
Psalm
108:5  Exalt Yourself above the heavens,
O Elohim, And Your esteem above all the earth;
Psalm
108:6  In order that those You love Might
be delivered. Save with Your right hand, And answer me.
Psalm
108:7  Elohim has spoken in His
set-apartness, “I exult, I portion out Sheḵem, And I measure out the
Valley of Sukkoth.
Psalm
108:8  “Gil‛aḏ is Mine,
Menashsheh is Mine, And Ephrayim is My chief defence, Yehuḏah is My
lawgiver.
Psalm
108:9  “Mo’aḇ is My wash-pot, Over
Eḏom I cast My shoe, Over Philistia I raise a shout.”
Psalm
108:10  Who would bring me into the
strong city? Who shall lead me to Eḏom?
Psalm
108:11  Have You not rejected us, O
Elohim? And You do not go out with our armies, O Elohim!
Psalm
108:12  Give us help from distress, For
the help of man is naught.
Psalm
108:13  In Elohim we do mightily, For it
is He who treads down our adversaries.
Psalm
109:1  Do not be silent, O Elohim of my
praise!
Psalm
109:2  For the mouth of the wrong And the
mouth of the deceiver Have opened against me; They have spoken against me with
a false tongue.
Psalm
109:3  They have surrounded me with words
of hatred, And they attack me without a cause.
Psalm
109:4  In return for my love they accuse
me, While I am in prayer.
Psalm
109:5  And they repay me evil for good,
And hatred for my love.
Psalm
109:6  Appoint over him one who is wrong,
And let an accuser stand at his right hand.
Psalm
109:7  When he is judged, let him be
found wrong, And let his prayer become sin.
Psalm
109:8  Let his days be few, Let another
take his office.
Psalm
109:9  Let his children be fatherless,
And his wife a widow.
Psalm
109:10  And let his children always
wander and beg, And seek food out of
their ruins.
Psalm
109:11  Let the creditor lay a snare for
all that he has, And let strangers plunder his labour.
Psalm
109:12  Let him have no one to extend
kindness, Nor any to show favour to his fatherless children.
Psalm
109:13  Let his descendants be cut off,
Their name be blotted out in the next generation.
Psalm
109:14  Let the crookedness of his
fathers Be remembered before יהוה, And let not the sin
of his mother be blotted out.
Psalm
109:15  Let them always be before יהוה,
And let Him cut off their remembrance from the earth;
Psalm
109:16  Because he did not remember to
show kindness, But persecuted the poor and needy man; And the broken-hearted,
to put to death.
Psalm
109:17  He also loved cursing, so let it
come to him; And he did not delight in blessing, so let it be far from him.
Psalm
109:18  And he put cursing on as with his
garment, So let it enter his inward parts like water, Into his bones and like
oil.
Psalm
109:19  Let it be to him like a cloak he
wraps around him, And as a girdle that he always girds on.
Psalm
109:20  This is the reward of my accusers
from יהוה, And to those speaking evil against my being.
Psalm
109:21  But You, O יהוה,
Master, Deal with me for Your Name’s sake; Because Your kindness is good,
deliver me.
Psalm
109:22  For I am poor and needy, And my
heart is pierced within me.
Psalm
109:23  I have gone like a lengthening
shadow, I have been driven away like a locust.
Psalm
109:24  My knees are weak through
fasting, And my flesh grows lean from fatness.
Psalm
109:25  And I, I have become a reproach
to them; They see me, they shake their heads.
Psalm
109:26  Help me, O יהוה
my Elohim! Save me according to Your kindness,
Psalm
109:27  And let them know that this is
Your hand. You, יהוה, You have done it!
Psalm
109:28  Let them curse, but You bless.
They shall arise, but be ashamed, And let Your servant rejoice.
Psalm
109:29  Let my accusers put on shame, And
be wrapped in their own confusion as in a cloak.
Psalm
109:30  I greatly thank יהוה
with my mouth, And I praise Him in the midst of the throng.
Psalm
109:31  For He stands at the right hand
of the poor, To save from those judging his being.
Psalm
110:1  יהוה said
to my Master, “Sit at My right hand, Until I make Your enemies a footstool for
Your feet.”
Psalm
110:2  יהוה sends
Your mighty sceptre out of Tsiyon. Rule in the midst of Your enemies!
Psalm
110:3  Your people volunteer in the day
of Your might, In the splendours of set-apartness! From the womb, from the
morning, You have the dew of Your youth!
Psalm
110:4  יהוה has
sworn and does not relent, “You are a priest forever According to the order of
Malkitseḏeq.”
Psalm
110:5  יהוה at
Your right hand Shall smite sovereigns in the day of His wrath.
Psalm
110:6  He judges among the nations, He
shall fill the nations with dead
bodies, He shall crush the Head over the mighty earth!
Psalm
110:7  He drinks of the stream by the
wayside, Therefore He does lift up the head!
Psalm
111:1  Praise Yah! I thank יהוה
with all my heart, In the company of the straight, and of the congregation.
Psalm
111:2  Great are the works of יהוה,
Searched for by all who delight in them.
Psalm
111:3  Splendour and greatness are His
work, And His righteousness stands forever.
Psalm
111:4  He has made His wonders to be
remembered; יהוה shows favour and is compassionate.
Psalm
111:5  He has given food to those who
fear Him; He remembers His covenant forever.
Psalm
111:6  He has shown His people the power
of His works, To give to them the inheritance of the gentiles.
Psalm
111:7  The works of His hands are truth
and right-ruling, All His orders are trustworthy,
Psalm
111:8  They are upheld forever and ever,
Performed in truth and straightness.
Psalm
111:9  He sent redemption to His people,
He has commanded His covenant forever. Set-apart and awesome is His Name.
Psalm
111:10  The fear of יהוה
is the beginning of wisdom, All those doing them have a good understanding. His
praise is standing forever.
Psalm
112:1  Praise Yah! Blessed is the man,
Who fears יהוה, Who has greatly delighted in His
commands.
Psalm
112:2  Mighty in the earth shall be his
seed, The generation of the straight ones shall be blessed.
Psalm
112:3  Wealth and riches are in his
house, And his righteousness is standing forever.
Psalm
112:4  Light has risen in the darkness to
the straight ones, Those showing
favour, The compassionate, And the righteous.
Psalm
112:5  Good is a man showing favour and
lending, He sustains his matters in right-ruling.
Psalm
112:6  For he is never shaken; The
righteous is remembered forever.
Psalm
112:7  He is not afraid of an evil
report. His heart is steadfast, trusting in יהוה.
Psalm
112:8  His heart is upheld, he is not
afraid, While he looks on his adversaries.
Psalm
112:9  He scattered abroad, He gave to
the poor, His righteousness is standing forever. His horn is exalted with
esteem.
Psalm
112:10  The wrong one sees it and shall
be vexed; He gnashes his teeth and shall melt. The desire of the wrong ones
does perish.
Psalm
113:1  Praise Yah! Praise, O servants of יהוה,
Praise the Name of יהוה !
Psalm
113:2  Blessed be the Name of יהוה,
Now and forever!
Psalm
113:3  From the rising of the sun to its
going down, The Name of יהוה is praised.
Psalm
113:4  יהוה is
high above all nations, His esteem above the heavens.
Psalm
113:5  Who is like יהוה
our Elohim, Who is enthroned on high?
Psalm
113:6  He looks down on the heavens and
in the earth; 
Psalm
113:7  He raises the poor out of the
dust, Lifts the needy from a dunghill,
Psalm
113:8  To make him sit with the nobles,
With the nobles of His people,
Psalm
113:9  Causing the barren woman to dwell in a house, A rejoicing
mother of children. Praise Yah!
Psalm
114:1  When Yisra’ĕl went out of
Mitsrayim, The house of Ya‛aqoḇ from a people of strange language,
Psalm
114:2  Yehuḏah became His set-apart
place, And Yisra’ĕl His rule.
Psalm
114:3  The sea saw it and fled; The Yardĕn
turned back.
Psalm
114:4  The mountains skipped like rams,
The little hills like lambs.
Psalm
114:5  Why was it, O sea, that you fled?
O Yardĕn, that you turned back?
Psalm
114:6  O mountains, that you skipped like
rams? O little hills, like lambs?
Psalm
114:7  Tremble, O earth, from the face of
the Master, From the face of the Eloah of Ya‛aqoḇ,
Psalm
114:8  Who turned the rock into a pool of
water, The flint into a fountain of water.
Psalm
115:1  Not to us, O יהוה,
not to us, But to Your Name give esteem, For Your kindness, For Your truth.
Psalm
115:2  Why should the gentiles say, “Where
now is their Elohim?”
Psalm
115:3  But our Elohim is in the heavens;
Whatever pleased Him, He has done.
Psalm
115:4  Their idols are silver and gold,
The work of men’s hands.
Psalm
115:5  They have mouths, but they do not
speak; They have eyes, but they do not see;
Psalm
115:6  They have ears, but they do not
hear; They have noses, but they do not smell;
Psalm
115:7  They have hands, but they do not
handle; They have feet, but they do not walk; They make no sound through their
throat.
Psalm
115:8  The ones who make them, shall
become like them – All who trust in them.
Psalm
115:9  O Yisra’ĕl, trust in יהוה
; He is their help and their shield.
Psalm
115:10  O house of Aharon, trust in יהוה
; He is their help and their shield.
Psalm
115:11  You who fear יהוה,
trust in יהוה ; He is their help and their shield.
Psalm
115:12  יהוה has
remembered us; He blesses us; He blesses the house of Yisra’ĕl; He blesses
the house of Aharon.
Psalm
115:13  He blesses those who fear יהוה,
The small and the great.
Psalm
115:14  יהוה give
you increase more and more, You and your children.
Psalm
115:15  You are blessed by יהוה,
Who made the heavens and earth.
Psalm
115:16  The heavens are the heavens of יהוה
; But He has given the earth to the children of men.
Psalm
115:17  The dead do not praise Yah, Nor
any going down to silence.
Psalm
115:18  But we, we bless Yah Now and
forever. Praise Yah!
Psalm
116:1  I love יהוה,
because He has heard my voice, my pleas. 
Psalm
116:2  Because He has inclined His ear to
me, And I shall call throughout my days.
Psalm
116:3  The cords of death were around me,
And the pains of the grave came upon me; I found distress and sorrow.
Psalm
116:4  Then I called upon the Name of יהוה,
“O יהוה, I pray to You, deliver my being!”
Psalm
116:5  יהוה shows
favour and is righteous; And our Elohim is compassionate.
Psalm
116:6  יהוה
guards the simple; I was brought low, but He saved me.
Psalm
116:7  Return to your rest, O my being,
For יהוה has treated you well.
Psalm
116:8  For You have delivered my being
from death, My eyes from tears, My feet from falling.
Psalm
116:9  I shall walk before יהוה
in the land of the living.
Psalm
116:10  I have believed, for I speak; I
have been greatly afflicted.
Psalm
116:11  I said in my haste, “All men are
liars.” 
Psalm
116:12  What shall I return to יהוה
? All His bounties are upon me.
Psalm
116:13  I lift up the cup of deliverance,
And call upon the Name of יהוה.
Psalm
116:14  I pay my vows to יהוה
Now in the presence of all His people.
Psalm
116:15  Precious in the eyes of יהוה
Is the death of His kind ones.
Psalm
116:16  O יהוה, I
am truly Your servant, I am Your servant, the son of Your female servant; You
have loosed my bonds.
Psalm
116:17  I bring You a slaughtering of
thanksgiving, And call upon the Name of יהוה.
Psalm
116:18  I pay my vows to יהוה
In the presence of all His people,
Psalm
116:19  In the courts of the House of יהוה,
In your midst, O Yerushalayim. Praise Yah!
Psalm
117:1  Praise יהוה,
all you nations! Extol Him, all you peoples!
Psalm
117:2  For His kindness is mighty over
us, And the truth of יהוה is everlasting. Praise Yah!
Psalm
118:1  Oh, give thanks to יהוה,
for He is good! Because His kindness is everlasting.
Psalm
118:2  Let Yisra’ĕl now say, “His
kindness is everlasting.”
Psalm
118:3  Let the house of Aharon now say, “His
kindness is everlasting.”
Psalm
118:4  Let those who fear יהוה
now say, “His kindness is everlasting.”
Psalm
118:5  I called on Yah in distress; Yah
answered me in a broad place.
Psalm
118:6  יהוה is on
my side; I do not fear what man does to me!
Psalm
118:7  יהוה is
for me among those helping me; Therefore I look on those hating me.
Psalm
118:8  It is better to take refuge in יהוה
Than to trust in man.
Psalm
118:9  It is better to take refuge in יהוה
Than to trust in princes.
Psalm
118:10  All the gentiles surrounded me,
In the Name of יהוה I shall cut them off.
Psalm
118:11  They surrounded me, Yea, they
surrounded me; In the Name of יהוה shall I cut them
off.
Psalm
118:12  They surrounded me like bees;
They were extinguished like burning thorns; In the Name of יהוה
I shall cut them off.
Psalm
118:13  Pushing, the enemy pushed me to fall, But יהוה

Psalm
120:3  What would one give to you, Or
what would one do to you, O treacherous tongue?
Psalm
120:4  Sharp arrows of a mighty man, With
coals of the broom-wood!
Psalm
120:5  Woe to me for I have sojourned in
Mesheḵ, I have dwelt among the tents of Qĕḏar!

him who hates peace.

us go into the House of יהוה.” 
Psalm
122:2  Our feet have been standing Within
your gates, O Yerushalayim!
Psalm
122:3  Yerushalayim is built As a city
that is bound together,
Psalm
122:4  Where the tribes have come up, The
tribes of Yah, A witness to Yisra’ĕl, To give thanks to the Name of יהוה.
Psalm
122:5  For there the thrones of
right-ruling were set, The thrones of the house of Dawiḏ.

Yerushalayim, Let those who love You be at rest.

who dwell in the heavens.
Psalm
123:2  See, as the eyes of servants Are
toward the hand of their masters, As the eyes of a female servant Are toward
the hand of her mistress, So are our eyes toward יהוה
our Elohim, Until He shows favour to us.
Psalm
123:3  Show favour to us, O יהוה,
show favour to us! For we are exceedingly filled with mockery.
Psalm
123:4  Our being is exceedingly filled
With the scoffing of those who are at ease, With the mockery of the proud.
Psalm
124:1  “If it had not been יהוה
who was on our side,” Let Yisra’ĕl now say;
Psalm
124:2  “If it had not been יהוה
who was on our side, When men rose up against us,
Psalm
124:3  “Then they would have swallowed us
alive, In their burning rage against us;
Psalm
124:4  “Then the waters would have
overwhelmed us, The stream would have gone over our being;
Psalm
124:5  “Then the proud waters Would have
gone over our being.”
Psalm
124:6  Blessed be יהוה,
Who did not give us as prey to their teeth.
Psalm
124:7  Our being has escaped like a bird
From the snare of the trappers; The snare was broken, and we have escaped.
Psalm
124:8  Our help is in the Name of יהוה,
Maker of the heavens and earth.
Psalm
125:1  Those who trust in יהוה
Are like Mount Tsiyon – It is not shaken, it remains forever.
Psalm
125:2  As the mountains surround
Yerushalayim, So יהוה surrounds His people, Now and
forever.
Psalm
125:3  For the sceptre of wrongness shall
not rest On the land allotted to the righteous, Lest the righteous stretch
forth their hands to unrighteousness.
Psalm
125:4  Do good, O יהוה,
to those who are good, And to those who are upright in their hearts.
Psalm
125:5  But those who turn aside to their
crooked ways, יהוה shall lead them away With the
workers of wickedness. Peace be upon Yisra’ĕl!
Psalm
126:1  When יהוה
turns back the captivity of Tsiyon, We shall be like dreamers.
Psalm
126:2  Then our mouth shall be filled
with laughter, And our tongue with singing, Then shall they say among the
gentiles, “ יהוה has done great deeds for them.”
Psalm
126:3  יהוה shall
do great deeds for us, We shall be
glad.
Psalm
126:4  Turn back our captivity, O יהוה,
Like the streams in the South.
Psalm
126:5  Those sowing in tears, shall reap
with songs of joy.
Psalm
126:6  He who goes on and weeps, Bearing
seed for sowing, Shall indeed come in with rejoicing, Bearing his sheaves.
Psalm
127:1  If יהוה
does not build the house, Its builders have laboured in vain. If יהוה
does not guard the city, The watchman has stayed awake in vain.
Psalm
127:2  In vain do you rise up early, To
sit up late, to eat the bread of toil; So He gives His beloved sleep.
Psalm
127:3  Look, children are an inheritance
from יהוה, The fruit of the womb is the reward.
Psalm
127:4  As arrows in the hand of a mighty
man, So are the children of one’s youth.
Psalm
127:5  Blessed is the man Who has filled
his quiver with them. They are not ashamed, When they speak with their enemies
in the gate.
Psalm
128:1  Blessed are all who fear יהוה,
Who walk in His ways.
Psalm
128:2  You shall eat the labour of your
hands. Be blessed, and let it be well with you.
Psalm
128:3  Let your wife be As a
fruit-bearing vine within your house, Your sons like olive plants all around
your table.
Psalm
128:4  Look, so shall the man be blessed
Who fears יהוה.
Psalm
128:5  יהוה shall
bless you out of Tsiyon, And let you see the good of Yerushalayim All the days
of your life,
Psalm
128:6  And let you see your children’s
children! Peace be upon Yisra’ĕl!
Psalm
129:1  “Often they have distressed me
from my youth.” Let Yisra’ĕl now say,
Psalm
129:2  “Often they have distressed me
from my youth, But they have not overcome me.
Psalm
129:3  “The ploughers ploughed on my
back, They made their furrows long.”
Psalm
129:4  יהוה is
righteous, He has cut the cords of the wrong in two.
Psalm
129:5  Let all those who hate Tsiyon Be
put to shame and turned back.
Psalm
129:6  Let them be as the grass on the
house-tops, Which withers before it grows up,
Psalm
129:7  That shall not fill the reaper’s
hand, Nor the sheaves fill the binder’s
bosom.
Psalm
129:8  And those who pass by shall not
say, “The blessing of יהוה be upon you; We have blessed
you in the Name of יהוה !”
Psalm
130:1  Out of the depths I have cried to
You, O יהוה. 
Psalm
130:2  O יהוה,
hear my voice! Let Your ears be attentive To the voice of my prayers.
Psalm
130:3  O Yah, if You should watch
crookednesses, O יהוה, who would stand?
Psalm
130:4  But with You there is forgiveness,
That You might be feared.
Psalm
130:5  I looked to יהוה,
My being has looked, And for His word I have waited.
Psalm
130:6  My being looks to יהוה More than those watching for
morning, watching for morning.
Psalm
130:7  O Yisra’ĕl, wait for יהוה
; For with יהוה there is kindness. And with Him is much
redemption,
Psalm
130:8  For He shall redeem Yisra’ĕl
From all his crookednesses.
Psalm
131:1  O יהוה, my
heart has not been proud, Nor have my eyes been haughty. Neither have I
concerned myself with great matters, Nor with those too wondrous for me.
Psalm
131:2  Have I not calmed, and kept my
being silent, Like one weaned by its mother? My being is like one weaned.
Psalm
131:3  O Yisra’ĕl, wait for יהוה,
Now and forever.
Psalm
132:1  O יהוה,
remember Dawiḏ, All his afflictions;
Psalm
132:2  How he swore to יהוה,
Vowed to the Mighty One of Ya‛aqoḇ:
Psalm
132:3  “Not to enter into my
dwelling-house, Not to get into my bed,
Psalm
132:4  “Not to give sleep to my eyes, Or
slumber to my eyelids,
Psalm
132:5  “Until I find a place for יהוה,
A dwelling place for the Mighty One of Ya‛aqoḇ.”
Psalm
132:6  See, we heard of it in Ephrathah;
We found it in the fields of the forest.
Psalm
132:7  Let us go into His dwelling
places; Let us bow ourselves at His footstool.
Psalm
132:8  Arise, O יהוה,
to Your place of rest, You and the ark of Your strength.
Psalm
132:9  Let Your priests put on
righteousness, And Your kind ones shout for joy.
Psalm
132:10  For the sake of Your servant Dawiḏ,
Do not turn away the face of Your Anointed One.
Psalm
132:11  יהוה has
sworn in truth to Dawiḏ; He does not turn from it, “Of the fruit of your
body I set upon your throne.
Psalm
132:12  “If your sons guard My covenant
And My witnesses that I teach them, Their sons shall sit upon your throne
forever.”
Psalm
132:13  For יהוה has
chosen Tsiyon, He has desired it for His dwelling:
Psalm
132:14  “This is My place of rest
forever; Here I dwell, for I have desired it.
Psalm
132:15  “I greatly bless her provision, I
satisfy her poor with bread.
Psalm
132:16  “And I put deliverance on her
priests, And her kind ones sing for joy.
Psalm
132:17  “There I make the horn of Dawiḏ
grow; I shall set up a lamp for My Anointed One.
Psalm
132:18  “I put shame on his enemies,
While on Him His diadem shall shine.”
Psalm
133:1  See how good and how pleasant it
is for brothers to dwell together in unity –
Psalm
133:2  Like the precious oil on the head,
Running down on the beard, The beard of Aharon, Running down on the collar of
his robes –
Psalm
133:3  Like the dew of Ḥermon, That
comes down on the mountains of Tsiyon. For there יהוה
commanded the blessing, Life forever!
Psalm
134:1  Come, bless יהוה,
All you servants of יהוה, Who are standing in the House
of יהוה by night!
Psalm
134:2  Lift up your hands in the
set-apart place, And bless יהוה.
Psalm
134:3  יהוה,
Maker of the heavens and earth, Does bless you from Tsiyon!
Psalm
135:1  Praise Yah! Praise the Name of יהוה
; Praise, you servants of יהוה,
Psalm
135:2  Who are standing in the House of יהוה,
In the courts of the House of our Elohim,
Psalm
135:3  Praise Yah, for יהוה
is good; Sing praises to His Name, for it is pleasant.
Psalm
135:4  For Yah has chosen Ya‛aqoḇ
for Himself, Yisra’ĕl for His treasured possession.
Psalm
135:5  For I know that יהוה
is great, And our Master is above all mighty ones.
Psalm
135:6  יהוה has
done whatever pleased Him, In the heavens and in earth, In the seas and in all
the depths,
Psalm
135:7  Causing vapours to go up From the
ends of the earth; He made lightning for the rain, Bringing forth wind from His
treasuries;
Psalm
135:8  Who smote the first-born of
Mitsrayim, From man to beast.
Psalm
135:9  He sent signs and wonders Into
your midst, O Mitsrayim, On Pharaoh and on all his servants;
Psalm
135:10  Who smote many nations, And slew
mighty sovereigns,
Psalm
135:11  Even Siḥon sovereign of the
Amorites, And Oḡ sovereign of Bashan, And all the reigns of Kena‛an.
Psalm
135:12  And He gave their land as an
inheritance, An inheritance to Yisra’ĕl His people.
Psalm
135:13  O יהוה,
Your Name is forever, O יהוה, Your remembrance to all
generations,
Psalm
135:14  For יהוה
rightly rules His people, And has compassion on His servants.
Psalm
135:15  The idols of the gentiles are
silver and gold, The work of men’s hands.
Psalm
135:16  They have mouths, but they do not
speak; They have eyes, but they do not see;
Psalm
135:17  They have ears, but they do not
hear; Also there is no breath in their mouth.
Psalm
135:18  Those making them become like
them, Everyone who is trusting in them.
Psalm
135:19  Bless יהוה,
O house of Yisra’ĕl! Bless יהוה, O house of
Aharon!
Psalm
135:20  Bless יהוה,
O house of Lĕwi! You who fear יהוה, bless יהוה
!
Psalm

be, Who dwells in Yerushalayim! Praise Yah.

first-born, For His kindness is everlasting;

from their midst, For His kindness is everlasting;
Psalm
136:12  With a strong hand, and with an
outstretched arm, For His kindness is everlasting;
Psalm
136:13  To Him who split apart the Sea of
Reeds, For His kindness is everlasting;
Psalm
136:14  And made Yisra’ĕl pass
through the midst of it, For His kindness is everlasting;
Psalm
136:15  But shook off Pharaoh and his
army in the Sea of Reeds, For His kindness is everlasting;
Psalm
136:16  To Him who led His people through
the wilderness, For His kindness is everlasting;
Psalm
136:17  To Him who smote great
sovereigns, For His kindness is everlasting;

136:18  And slew mighty sovereigns, For
His kindness is everlasting;

136:21  And gave their land as an
inheritance, For His kindness is everlasting;
Psalm
136:22  An inheritance to Yisra’ĕl
His servant, For His kindness is everlasting.
Psalm
136:23  Who remembered us in our
humiliation, For His kindness is everlasting;
Psalm
136:24  And rescued us from our
adversaries, For His kindness is everlasting;
Psalm
136:25  Who gives food to all flesh, For
His kindness is everlasting.
Psalm
136:26  Give thanks to the Ĕl of the
heavens! For His kindness is everlasting.
Psalm
137:1  By the rivers of Baḇel,
There we sat down and we wept As we remembered Tsiyon.
Psalm
137:2  We hung our lyres Upon the willows
in the midst of it.
Psalm
137:3  For there our captors Asked us for
the words of a song, And our plunderers for rejoicing, saying, “Sing to us a song of Tsiyon!”
Psalm
137:4  How could we sing the song of יהוה
On foreign soil?
Psalm
137:5  If I forget you, O Yerushalayim,
Let my right hand forget.
Psalm
137:6  Let my tongue cleave to my palate,
If I do not remember you, If I do not exalt Yerushalayim Above my chief joy.
Psalm
137:7  Remember, O יהוה,
against the sons of Eḏom The day of Yerushalayim, Who said, “Lay it bare,
lay it bare, To its foundation!”
Psalm
137:8  O daughter of Baḇel, who are
to be destroyed, Blessed is he who repays you your deed, What you did to us!
Psalm
137:9  Blessed is he who shall take And
dash your little ones against the rock.
Psalm
138:1  I give You thanks with all my
heart; Before the mighty ones I sing praises to You.
Psalm
138:2  I bow myself toward Your set-apart
Hĕḵal, And give thanks to Your Name For Your kindness and for Your
truth; For You have made great Your Word, Your Name, above all.
Psalm
138:3  On the day I called You did answer
me, You made me bold with strength in my being.
Psalm
138:4  Let all the sovereigns of the
earth Give thanks to You, O יהוה, When they shall hear
the words of Your mouth.
Psalm
138:5  And let them sing of the ways of יהוה,
For great is the esteem of יהוה.
Psalm
138:6  Though יהוה
is exalted, He looks on the humble; But the proud He perceives from a distance.
Psalm
138:7  Though I walk in the midst of
distress, You revive me; You stretch out Your hand Against the wrath of my
enemies, And Your right hand saves me.
Psalm
138:8  יהוה does
perfect for me. O יהוה, Your kindness is everlasting.
Do not forsake the works of Your hands.
Psalm
139:1  O יהוה,
You have searched me And know me.
Psalm
139:2  You know my sitting down and my
rising up; You understand my thought from afar.
Psalm
139:3  You sift my path and my lying
down, And know well all my ways.
Psalm
139:4  For there is not a word on my
tongue, But see, O יהוה, You know it all!
Psalm
139:5  You have closed me in, behind and
before, And laid Your hand upon me –
Psalm
139:6  Knowledge too wondrous for me, It
is high, I am unable to reach it.
Psalm
139:7  Where would I go from Your Spirit?
Or where would I flee from Your face?
Psalm
139:8  If I go up into the heavens, You
are there; If I make my bed in the grave, see, You are there.
Psalm
139:9  I take the wings of the morning, I
dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea,
Psalm
139:10  There, too, Your hand would lead
me, And Your right hand hold me.
Psalm
139:11  If I say, “Darkness shall cover
me,” Then night would be light to me;
Psalm
139:12  Even darkness is not dark for
You, But night shines as the day – As is darkness, so is light.
Psalm
139:13  For You, You possessed my
kidneys, You have covered me in my mother’s womb.
Psalm
139:14  I give thanks to You, For I am
awesomely and wondrously made! Wondrous are Your works, And my being knows it
well.
Psalm
139:15  My bones was not concealed from
You, When I was shaped in a hidden place, Knit together in the depths of the
earth.
Psalm
139:16  Your eyes saw my unformed body.
And in Your book all of them were written, The days they were formed, While
none was among them.
Psalm
139:17  And how precious are Your
thoughts to me, O Ĕl! How great has been the sum of them!
Psalm
139:18  If I should count them, They
would be more than the sand; When I wake up, I am still with You.
Psalm
139:19  Oh, that You would slay the
wrong, O Eloah! Depart from me, therefore, men of bloodshed!
Psalm
139:20  They speak against You wickedly.
Bring Your enemies to naught!
Psalm
139:21  O יהוה,
do I not hate them, who hate You? And do I not loathe those who rise up against
You?
Psalm
139:22  With a complete hatred I hate
them; They have become my enemies.
Psalm
139:23  Search me, O Ĕl, and know my
heart; Try me, and know my thoughts;
Psalm
139:24  And see if an idolatrous way is
in me, And lead me in the way everlasting.
Psalm
140:1  Rescue me, O יהוה,
from men of evil; Preserve me from men of violence,
Psalm
140:2  Who have devised evils in their
hearts; They stir up conflicts all day long.
Psalm
140:3  They sharpen their tongues like a
snake; The poison of cobras is under their lips. Selah.
Psalm
140:4  Guard me, O יהוה,
from the hands of the wrong; Guard me from a man of violence, Who have schemed
to trip up my steps.
Psalm
140:5  The proud have hidden a trap for
me, and cords; They have spread a net by the wayside; They have set snares for
me. Selah.
Psalm
140:6  I said to יהוה,
“You are my Ĕl; Hear the voice of my prayers, O יהוה.
Psalm
140:7  “O Master יהוה,
my saving strength, You have screened my head in the day of battle.
Psalm
140:8  “Do not grant the desires of the
wrong, O יהוה ; Do not promote his scheme. Selah.
Psalm
140:9  “Those who surround me lift up
their head; The trouble of their lips cover them;
Psalm
140:10  “Let burning coals fall on them;
Let them be made to fall into the fire, Into deep pits, let them not rise
again.
Psalm
140:11  “Let not a slanderer be
established in the earth; Let evil hunt the man of violence speedily.”
Psalm
140:12  I have known that יהוה
maintains The cause of the afflicted, The right-ruling of the poor.
Psalm
140:13  Only, let the righteous give
thanks to Your Name, Let the straight ones dwell in Your presence.
Psalm
141:1  יהוה, I
have cried out to You; Hasten to me! Give ear to my voice when I cry out to
You.
Psalm
141:2  Let my prayer be prepared before
You as incense, The lifting up of my hands as the evening offering.
Psalm
141:3  O יהוה,
set a guard for my mouth; Watch over the door of my lips.
Psalm
141:4  Let not my heart be inclined to
evil, To practise deeds of wrongness With men working wickedness, And let me
not eat of their delicacies.
Psalm
141:5  Let the righteous one smite me Or
reprove me in kindness – It is oil on my head. Let my head not refuse it. My
prayer is still against their evil deeds.
Psalm
141:6  Their judges have been thrown down
By the sides of the rock, But they have heard my words, For they have been
pleasant.
Psalm
141:7  Our bones are scattered at the
mouth of the grave, As when one ploughs and breaks up the earth.
Psalm
141:8  But my eyes are upon You, O Master
יהוה. In You I take refuge; Do not pour out my life.
Psalm
141:9  Guard me from the clutches Of the
trap they have laid for me, And from the snares Of the workers of wickedness.
Psalm
141:10  Let the wrong fall into their own
nets, While I pass by.
Psalm
142:1  I cry out to יהוה
with my voice; I pray to יהוה with my voice.
Psalm
142:2  I pour out my complaint before
Him; I declare before Him my distress.
Psalm
142:3  When my spirit grew faint within
me, Then You know my path. In the way in which I walk They have hidden a trap
for me.
Psalm
142:4  Look to the right hand and see,
And no one is concerned for me; No refuge remains to me; No one inquires after
my being.
Psalm
142:5  I cried out to You, O יהוה
: I said, “You are my refuge, My portion in the land of the living.
Psalm
142:6  “Listen to my cry, For I am
brought very low; Deliver me from my persecutors, For they are too strong for
me.
Psalm
142:7  “Bring my being out of prison, To
give thanks to Your Name. Let the righteous gather around me, Because You deal
kindly with me.”
Psalm
143:1  Hear my prayer, O יהוה,
Give ear to my pleadings In Your trustworthiness. Answer me in Your
righteousness.
Psalm
143:2  And do not enter into right-ruling
with Your servant, For before You no one living is in the right.
Psalm
143:3  For the enemy has pursued my being;
He has crushed my life to the ground; He has made me dwell in dark places, Like
the dead of old.
Psalm
143:4  Therefore my spirit grew faint
within me, My heart within me is stunned.
Psalm
143:5  I remembered the days of old; I
meditated on all Your works; I ponder on the work of Your hands.
Psalm
143:6  I have spread out my hands to You;
My being is like a thirsty land for You. Selah.
Psalm
143:7  Hasten, answer me, O יהוה
; My spirit fails! Do not hide Your face from me, Lest I be like those going
down into the pit.
Psalm
143:8  Let me hear Your kindness in the
morning, For in You I have put my trust; Let me know the way in which I should
walk, For I have lifted up my being to You.
Psalm
143:9  Deliver me from my enemies, O יהוה
; I take refuge in You.
Psalm
143:10  Teach me to do Your good
pleasure, For You are my Elohim. Let Your good Spirit lead me In the land of
straightness.
Psalm
143:11  For the sake of Your Name, O יהוה,
revive me! In Your righteousness, Bring my being out of distress.
Psalm
143:12  And in Your kindness, Cut off my
enemies. And destroy all the adversaries of my life, For I am Your servant!
Psalm
144:1  Blessed be יהוה
my Rock, Who is teaching my hands for fighting, My fingers for battle;
Psalm
144:2  My kindness and my stronghold, My
tower and my deliverer, My shield, and in whom I take refuge, Who is subduing
peoples under me.
Psalm
144:3  יהוה, what
is man, that You should know him? Son of man, that You should think of him?
Psalm
144:4  Man is like a breath, His days
like a passing shadow.
Psalm
144:5  Incline Your heavens, O יהוה,
and come down; Touch the mountains that they smoke.
Psalm
144:6  Send forth lightning and scatter
them, Send forth Your arrows and confuse them.
Psalm
144:7  Send forth Your hand from above;
Rescue me and deliver me out of great waters, From the hand of foreigners,
Psalm
144:8  Whose mouth has spoken falsehood,
And whose right hand is a right hand of lies.
Psalm
144:9  O Elohim, a new song I sing to
You; On a harp of ten strings I sing praises to You,
Psalm
144:10  Who gives deliverance to
sovereigns, Who rescues Dawiḏ His servant From the evil sword.
Psalm
144:11  Rescue me and deliver me from the
hand of foreigners, Whose mouth has spoken falsehood, And whose right hand is a
right hand of lies;
Psalm
144:12  Because our sons are like plants
Grown up in their youth; Our daughters like hewn stones, Polished, like a
palace building;
Psalm
144:13  Let our storehouses be filled,
Supplying all kinds; Let our sheep bring forth thousands And ten thousands in
our fields;
Psalm
144:14  Our cattle well-laden; No
breaking in, no going out; And no crying in our streets.
Psalm
144:15  Blessed are the people who have
it so; Blessed are the people whose Elohim is יהוה !
Psalm
145:1  I exalt You, my Elohim, O
Sovereign; And bless Your Name forever and ever.
Psalm
145:2  All day long I bless You, And
praise Your Name forever and ever.
Psalm
145:3  Great is יהוה,
and greatly to be praised; And His greatness is unsearchable.
Psalm
145:4  Generation after generation praise
Your works, And they declare Your mighty acts.
Psalm
145:5  I declare the esteemed splendour
of Your excellency, And the matters of Your wondrous works.
Psalm
145:6  And they speak of the might of
Your awesome acts, And I recount Your greatness.
Psalm
145:7  They send forth the remembrance of
Your great goodness, And they sing of Your righteousness.
Psalm
145:8  יהוה shows
favour and is compassionate, Patient and great in kindness.
Psalm
145:9  יהוה is
good to all, And He has compassion on all His works.
Psalm
145:10  All Your works give thanks to
You, O יהוה, And Your kind ones bless You.
Psalm
145:11  They speak of the esteem of Your
reign, And talk of Your might,
Psalm
145:12  To make known to the sons of men
His mighty acts, And the esteemed splendour of His reign.
Psalm
145:13  Your reign is an everlasting
reign, And Your rule is throughout all generations.
Psalm
145:14  יהוה is
supporting all who are falling, And raising up all who are bowed down.
Psalm
145:15  The eyes of all look to You
expectantly, And You are giving them their food in its season,
Psalm
145:16  Opening Your hand and satisfying
The desire of all that live.
Psalm
145:17  יהוה is
righteous in all His ways, And kind in all His works.
Psalm
145:18  יהוה is
near to all who call upon Him, To all who call upon Him in truth.
Psalm
145:19  He does the desire of those who
fear Him; And He hears their cry and saves them.
Psalm
145:20  יהוה
preserves all those loving Him, But all the wrong ones He destroys.
Psalm
145:21  My mouth speaks the praise of יהוה,
And let all flesh bless His set-apart Name, Forever and ever.
Psalm
146:1  Praise Yah! Praise יהוה,
O my being!
Psalm
146:2  While I live I praise יהוה
; I sing praises to my Elohim while I exist.
Psalm
146:3  Do not put your trust in princes,
In a son of man, in whom is no deliverance.
Psalm
146:4  His spirit goes out, he returns to
his earth; In that day his plans perish.
Psalm
146:5  Blessed is he who has the Ĕl
of Ya‛aqoḇ for his help, Whose expectancy is in יהוה
his Elohim,
Psalm
146:6  Maker of the heavens and earth,
The sea and all that is in them, Who is guarding truth forever,
Psalm
146:7  Doing right-ruling for the
oppressed, Giving bread to the hungry. יהוה releases
those who are bound,
Psalm
146:8  יהוה opens
the eyes of the blind, יהוה
raises those who are bowed down, יהוה loves the
righteous.
Psalm
146:9  יהוה
guards the strangers, He lifts up the fatherless and widow, But the way of the
wrong ones He turns upside down.
Psalm
146:10  יהוה
reigns forever, O Tsiyon, Your Elohim to all generations. Praise Yah!
Psalm
147:1  Praise Yah! For it is good to sing
praises to our Elohim. For it is pleasant – praise is fitting.
Psalm
147:2  יהוה
builds up Yerushalayim, He gathers the outcasts of Yisra’ĕl –
Psalm
147:3  He heals the broken-hearted And binds up their wounds.
Psalm
147:4  He appoints the number of the stars, He gives names to all of them.
Psalm
147:5  Great is our Master and mighty in
power, There is no limit to His understanding.
Psalm
147:6  יהוה lifts
up the meek ones, He throws the wrong ones down to the ground.
Psalm
147:7  Respond to יהוה
with thanksgiving; Sing praises on a lyre to our Elohim,
Psalm
147:8  Who covers the heavens with
clouds, Who prepares rain for the earth, Who makes grass to sprout on the
mountains,
Psalm
147:9  Giving to the beast its food, To
the young ravens that cry.
Psalm
147:10  He does not delight in the
strength of the horse, He takes no pleasure in the legs of a man.
Psalm
147:11  יהוה
takes pleasure in those who fear Him, In those who wait for His kindness.
Psalm
147:12  Extol יהוה,
O Yerushalayim! Praise your Elohim, O Tsiyon!
Psalm
147:13  For He has strengthened the bars
