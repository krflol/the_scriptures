Yonah/Jonah
Jonah
1:1  And the word of יהוה
came to Yonah son of Amittai, saying, 
Jonah
1:2  “Arise, go to Ninewĕh, the
great city, and cry out against it, for their evils have come up before Me.” 
Jonah
1:3  But Yonah rose up to flee to
Tarshish from the presence of יהוה, and went down to
Yapho, and found a ship going to Tarshish. And he paid the fare, and went down
into it, to go with them to Tarshish from the presence of יהוה.

Jonah
1:4  And יהוה
sent out a great wind on the sea, and there was a great storm on the sea, so
that the ship was thought to be broken up. 
Jonah
1:5  And the seamen were afraid, and each
one cried out to his mighty one, and threw the cargo which was in the ship into
the sea, to lighten the load. But Yonah had gone down into the lowest parts of
the ship, and he lay down, and was fast asleep. 
Jonah
1:6  And the captain came to him, and
said to him, “What do you mean, sleeper? Arise, cry out to your Elohim, if so
be that Elohim shall think about us, so that we do not perish.” 
Jonah
1:7  And they said to each other, “Come,
and let us cast lots, so that we know for whose sake this evil has come upon
us.” So they cast lots, and the lot fell on Yonah. 
Jonah
1:8  So they said to him, “Please explain
to us! For whose sake is this evil upon us? What is your occupation? And where
do you come from? What is your country? And from what people are you?” 
Jonah
1:9  And he said to them, “I am a Heḇrew.
And I am fearing יהוה, the Elohim of the heavens, who
made the sea and the dry land.” 
Jonah
1:10  And the men were exceedingly
afraid, and said to him, “Why have you done this?” For the men knew that he
fled from the presence of יהוה, for he had informed
them. 
Jonah
1:11  And they said to him, “What are we
to do to you to make the sea calm for us?” For the sea was growing more stormy.

Jonah
1:12  And he said to them, “Take me and
throw me into the sea, so that the sea becomes calm for you. For I know that
this great storm is because of me.” 
Jonah
1:13  However, the men rowed hard to
bring the ship to land, but were unable, for the sea continued to grow more
stormy against them. 
Jonah
1:14  And they cried out to יהוה
and said, “We pray, O יהוה, please, let us not perish
for this man’s life, and do not lay on us innocent blood. For You, O יהוה,
have done as it pleased You.” 
Jonah
1:15  Then they took Yonah and threw him
into the sea, and the sea stopped raging. 
Jonah
1:16  And the men feared יהוה
exceedingly, and brought an offering to יהוה and made
vows. 
Jonah
1:17  But יהוה
appointed a great fish to swallow Yonah. And Yonah was in the stomach of the
fish three days and three nights. 
Jonah
2:1  And Yonah prayed to יהוה
his Elohim from the stomach of the fish. 
Jonah
2:2  And he said, “I called to יהוה
because of my distress, and He answered me. From the stomach of the grave I
cried, and You heard my voice. 
Jonah
2:3  “For You threw me into the deep,
into the heart of the seas, and the floods surrounded me. All Your breakers and
Your waves passed over me. 
Jonah
2:4  “So I said, ‘I have been driven away
from Your eyes. Would I ever look again toward Your set-apart Hĕḵal?’

Jonah
2:5  “Waters encompassed me, unto life,
the deep closed around me, weeds were wrapped around my head. 
Jonah
2:6  “I went down to the base of the
mountains, the earth with its bars were behind me forever. But You brought up
my life from the pit, O יהוה, my Elohim. 
Jonah
2:7  “When my life fainted within me, I
remembered יהוה. And my prayer went up to You, into
Your set-apart Hĕḵal. 
Jonah
2:8  “Those observing false
worthlessnesses forsake their own kindness. 
Jonah
2:9  “But I offer to You with the voice
of thanksgiving, I pay what I have vowed. Deliverance is of יהוה.”

Jonah
2:10  Then יהוה
spoke to the fish, and it vomited Yonah on the dry land. 
Jonah
3:1  And the word of יהוה
came to Yonah the second time, saying, 
Jonah
3:2  “Arise, go to Ninewĕh, that
great city, and proclaim to it the message that I am speaking to you.” 
Jonah
3:3  And Yonah arose and went to Ninewĕh,
according to the word of יהוה. Now Ninewĕh was a
great city before Elohim, of three day’s journey. 
Jonah
3:4  And Yonah began to go in to the city
on the first day’s walk. And he cried out and said, “Yet forty days, and Ninewĕh
shall be overthrown!” 
Jonah
3:5  And the men of Ninewĕh believed
in Elohim, and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest to
the least of them. 
Jonah
3:6  And the word reached the sovereign
of Ninewĕh, so he arose from his throne and took off his robe, and covered
himself with sackcloth and sat in ashes. 
Jonah
3:7  And he proclaimed and said
throughout Ninewĕh, “By decree of the sovereign and his nobles: No man or
beast, herd or flock, shall taste whatever – let them not eat, let them not
even drink water. 
Jonah
3:8  “But let man and beast be covered
with sackcloth, and call mightily to Elohim. And let each one turn from his
evil way and from the violence that is in his hands. 
Jonah
3:9  “Who knows whether Elohim does turn
and relent, and shall turn away from the heat of His displeasure, so that we do
not perish?” 
Jonah
3:10  And Elohim saw their works, that
they turned from their evil way. And Elohim relented from the evil which He had
said He would do to them, and He did not do it. 
Jonah
4:1  But it greatly displeased Yonah, and
he was grieved. 
Jonah
4:2  And he prayed to יהוה,
and he said, “Please, יהוה, was this not what I said
while I was in my own land? This is why I went ahead and fled to Tarshish. For
I know that You are an Ĕl showing favour, and compassionate, patient and
of great kindness, and relenting from doing evil. 
Jonah
4:3  “And now, O יהוה,
please take my life from me, for it is better for me to die than to live!” 
Jonah
4:4  And יהוה
said, “Are you right to be displeased?” 
Jonah
4:5  Then Yonah went out of the city and
sat on the east side of the city, and made himself a shelter there, and sat
under it in the shade, to see what would become of the city. 
Jonah
4:6  And יהוה
Elohim appointed a plant and made it come up over Yonah, to be a shade for his
head to deliver him from his discomfort. And Yonah greatly rejoiced over the
plant. 
Jonah
4:7  But as morning dawned the next day
Elohim appointed a worm which attacked the plant so that it withered. 
Jonah
4:8  And it came to be when the sun came
up, that Elohim appointed a scorching east wind, and the sun smote on Yonah’s
head, so that he grew faint, and asked for his life to die, and said, “It is
better for me to die than to live.” 
Jonah
4:9  And Elohim said to Yonah, “Have you
rightly become displeased over the plant?” And he said, “I have rightly become
displeased, even to death!” 
Jonah
4:10  And יהוה
said, “You felt sorry for the plant for which you have not laboured, nor made
it grow, which came up in a night and perished in a night. 
Jonah
4:11  “And should I not pardon Ninewĕh,
that great city, in which are more than one hundred and twenty thousand beings
who have not known their right hand from their left, and much cattle?”
