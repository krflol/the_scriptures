Berĕshith/Genesis
Gen
1:1  In the beginning Elohim created the
heavens and the earth.
Gen
1:2  And the earth came to be formless
and empty, and darkness was on the face of the deep. And the Spirit of Elohim
was moving on the face of the waters.
Gen
1:3  And Elohim said, “Let light come to
be,” and light came to be. 
Gen
1:4  And Elohim saw the light, that it
was good. And Elohim separated the light from the darkness. 
Gen
1:5  And Elohim called the light ‘day’
and the darkness He called ‘night.’ And there came to be evening and there came
to be morning, the first day. 
Gen
1:6  And Elohim said, “Let an expanse
come to be in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the
waters.” 
Gen
1:7  And Elohim made the expanse, and
separated the waters which were under the expanse from the waters which were
above the expanse. And it came to be so. 
Gen
1:8  And Elohim called the expanse ‘heavens.’
And there came to be evening and there came to be morning, the second day. 
Gen
1:9  And Elohim said, “Let the waters
under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land
appear.” And it came to be so. 
Gen
1:10  And Elohim called the dry land ‘earth,’
and the collection of the waters He called ‘seas.’ And Elohim saw that it was
good. 
Gen
1:11  And Elohim said, “Let the earth
bring forth grass, the plant that yields seed, and the fruit tree that yields
fruit according to its kind, whose seed is in itself, on the earth.” And it
came to be so. 
Gen
1:12  And the earth brought forth grass,
the plant that yields seed according to its kind, and the tree that yields
fruit, whose seed is in itself according to its kind. And Elohim saw that it
was good. 
Gen
1:13  And there came to be evening and
there came to be morning, the third day. 
Gen
1:14  And Elohim said, “Let lights come
to be in the expanse of the heavens to separate the day from the night, and let
them be for signs and appointed times, and for days and years, 
Gen
1:15  and let them be for lights in the
expanse of the heavens to give light on the earth.” And it came to be so. 
Gen
1:16  And Elohim made two great lights:
the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night, and
the stars. 
Gen
1:17  And Elohim set them in the expanse
of the heavens to give light on the earth, 
Gen
1:18  and to rule over the day and over
the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. And Elohim saw that it
was good. 
Gen
1:19  And there came to be evening and
there came to be morning, the fourth day. 
Gen
1:20  And Elohim said, “Let the waters
teem with shoals of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth on the
face of the expanse of the heavens.” 
Gen
1:21  And Elohim created great sea
creatures and every living creature that moves, with which the waters teemed,
according to their kind, and every winged bird according to its kind. And
Elohim saw that it was good. 
Gen
1:22  And Elohim blessed them, saying, “Bear
fruit and increase, and fill the waters in the seas, and let the birds increase
on the earth.” 
Gen
1:23  And there came to be evening and
there came to be morning, the fifth day. 
Gen
1:24  And Elohim said, “Let the earth
bring forth the living creature according to its kind: livestock and creeping
creatures and beasts of the earth, according to its kind.” And it came to be
so. 
Gen
1:25  And Elohim made the beast of the earth
according to its kind, livestock according to its kind, and all that creep on
the earth according to its kind. And Elohim saw that it was good. 
Gen
1:26  And Elohim said, “Let Us make man
in Our image, according to Our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the
sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over the livestock, and over all
the earth and over all the creeping creatures that creep on the earth.” 
Gen
1:27  And Elohim created the man in His
image, in the image of Elohim He created him – male and female He created them.

Gen
1:28  And Elohim blessed them, and Elohim
said to them, “Bear fruit and increase, and fill the earth and subdue it, and
rule over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over all
creatures moving on the earth.” 
Gen
1:29  And Elohim said, “See, I have given
you every plant that yields seed which is on the face of all the earth, and
every tree whose fruit yields seed, to you it is for food. 
Gen
1:30  “And to every beast of the earth,
and to every bird of the heavens, and to every creeping creature on the earth,
in which there is life, every green plant is for food.” And it came to be so. 
Gen
1:31  And Elohim saw all that He had
made, and see, it was very good. And there came to be evening and there came to
be morning, the sixth day. 
Gen
2:1  Thus the heavens and the earth were
completed, and all their array. 
Gen
2:2  And on the seventh day Elohim
completed His work which He had done, and He rested on the seventh day from all
His work which He had made. 
Gen
2:3  And Elohim blessed the seventh day
and set it apart, because on it He rested from all His work which Elohim in
creating had made. 
Gen
2:4  These are the births of the heavens
and the earth when they were created, in the day that יהוה
Elohim made earth and heavens. 
Gen
2:5  Now no shrub of the field was yet on
the earth, and no plant of the field had yet sprung up, for יהוה
Elohim had not sent rain on the earth, and there was no man to till the ground,

Gen
2:6  but a mist went up from the earth
and watered the entire surface of the ground. 
Gen
2:7  And יהוה
Elohim formed the man out of dust from the ground, and breathed into his
nostrils breath of life. And the man became a living being. 
Gen
2:8  And יהוה
Elohim planted a garden in Ĕḏen, to the east, and there He put the
man whom He had formed. 
Gen
2:9  And out of the ground יהוה
Elohim made every tree grow that is pleasant to the sight and good for food,
with the tree of life in the midst of the garden and the tree of the knowledge
of good and evil. 
Gen
2:10  And a river went out of Ĕḏen
to water the garden, and from there it divided and became four riverheads. 
Gen
2:11  The name of the first is Pishon, it
is the one surrounding the entire land of Ḥawilah, where there is gold. 
Gen
2:12  And the gold of that land is good.
Bdellium is there, and the shoham stone. 
Gen
2:13  And the name of the second river is
Giḥon, it is the one surrounding the entire land of Kush. 
Gen
2:14  And the name of the third river is Ḥiddeqel,
it is the one which goes toward the east of Ashshur. And the fourth river is
the Euphrates. 
Gen
2:15  And יהוה
Elohim took the man and put him in the garden of Ĕḏen to work it and
to guard it. 
Gen
2:16  And יהוה
Elohim commanded the man, saying, “Eat of every tree of the garden, 
Gen
2:17  but do not eat of the tree of the
knowledge of good and evil, for in the day that you eat of it you shall
certainly die.” 
Gen
2:18  And יהוה
Elohim said, “It is not good for the man to be alone, I am going to make a
helper for him, as his counterpart.” 
Gen
2:19  And from the ground יהוה
Elohim formed every beast of the field and every bird of the heavens, and
brought them to the man to see what he would call them. And whatever the man
called each living creature, that was its name. 
Gen
2:20  So the man gave names to all
livestock, and to the birds of the heavens, and to every beast of the field.
But for the man there was not found a helper for him, as his counterpart. 
Gen
2:21  So יהוה
Elohim caused a deep sleep to fall on the man, and he slept. And He took one of
his ribs, and closed up the flesh in its place. 
Gen
2:22  And the rib which יהוה
Elohim had taken from the man He made into a woman, and He brought her to the
man. 
Gen
2:23  And the man said, “This is now bone
of my bones and flesh of my flesh. This one is called ‘woman,’ because she was
taken out of man.” 
Gen
2:24  For this cause a man shall leave
his father and mother, and cleave to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.

Gen
2:25  And they were both naked, the man
and his wife, yet they were not ashamed. 
Gen
3:1  And the serpent was more crafty than
any beast of the field which יהוה Elohim had made, and
he said to the woman, “Is it true that Elohim has said, ‘Do not eat of every
tree of the garden’?” 
Gen
3:2  And the woman said to the serpent, “We
are to eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden, 
Gen
3:3  but of the fruit of the tree which
is in the midst of the garden, Elohim has said, ‘Do not eat of it, nor touch
it, lest you die.’ ” 
Gen
3:4  And the serpent said to the woman, “You
shall certainly not die. 
Gen
3:5  “For Elohim knows that in the day
you eat of it your eyes shall be opened, and you shall be like Elohim, knowing
good and evil.” 
Gen
3:6  And the woman saw that the tree was
good for food, that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree desirable to make
one wise, and she took of its fruit and ate. And she also gave to her husband
with her, and he ate. 
Gen
3:7  Then the eyes of both of them were
opened, and they knew that they were naked. And they sewed fig leaves together
and made loin coverings for themselves. 
Gen
3:8  And they heard the sound of יהוה
Elohim walking about in the garden in the cool of the day, and Aḏam and
his wife hid themselves from the presence of יהוה
Elohim among the trees of the garden. 
Gen
3:9  And יהוה
Elohim called unto Aḏam and said to him, “Where are you?” 
Gen
3:10  And he said, “I heard Your voice in
the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked, so I hid myself.” 
Gen
3:11  And He said, “Who made you know
that you were naked? Have you eaten of the tree of which I commanded you that
you should not eat?” 
Gen
3:12  And the man said, “The woman whom
You gave to be with me, she gave me of the tree and I ate.” 
Gen
3:13  And יהוה
Elohim said to the woman, “What is this you have done?” And the woman said, “The
serpent deceived me, and I ate.” 
Gen
3:14  And יהוה
Elohim said to the serpent, “Because you have done this, you are cursed more
than all livestock and more than every beast of the field. On your belly you
are to go, and eat dust all the days of your life. 
Gen
3:15  “And I put enmity between you and
the woman, and between your seed and her Seed. He shall crush your head, and
you shall crush His heel.”
Gen
3:16  To the woman He said, “I greatly
increase your sorrow and your conception – bring forth children in pain. And
your desire is for your husband, and he does rule over you.” 
Gen
3:17  And to the man He said, “Because
you have listened to the voice of your wife, and have eaten of the tree of
which I commanded you, saying, ‘Do not eat of it’: “Cursed is the ground
because of you, in toil you are to eat of it all the days of your life, 
Gen
3:18  and the ground shall bring forth thorns and thistles for you, and you
shall eat the plants of the field. 
Gen
3:19  “By the sweat of your face you are
to eat bread until you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken. For
dust you are, and to dust you return.” 
Gen
3:20  And the man called his wife’s name Ḥawwah,
because she became the mother of all living. 
Gen
3:21  And יהוה
Elohim made coats of skin for the man and his wife and dressed them. 
Gen
3:22  And יהוה
Elohim said, “See, the man has become like one of Us, to know good and evil.
And now, lest he put out his hand and take also of the tree of life, and eat,
and live forever...” 
Gen
3:23  so יהוה
Elohim sent him out of the garden of Ĕḏen to till the ground from
which he was taken, 
Gen
3:24  and He drove the man out. And He
placed keruḇim at the east of the garden of Ĕḏen, and a
flaming sword which turned every way, to guard the way to the tree of life. 
Gen
4:1  And Aḏam knew Ḥawwah his
wife, and she conceived and bore Qayin, and said, “I have gained a man from יהוה.”

Gen
4:2  And again, she gave birth to his
brother Heḇel. And Heḇel became a keeper of sheep, but Qayin became
a tiller of the ground. 
Gen
4:3  And it came to be, in the course of
time, that Qayin brought an offering of the fruit of the ground to יהוה.

Gen
4:4  And Heḇel also brought of the
first-born of his flock and of their fat. And יהוה
looked to Heḇel and his offering, 
Gen
4:5  but He did not look to Qayin and his
offering. And Qayin was very wroth, and his face fell. 
Gen
4:6  And יהוה
said to Qayin, “Why are you wroth? And why is your face fallen? 
Gen
4:7  “If you do well, is there not
acceptance? And if you do not do well, sin is crouching at the door. And its
desire is for you, but you should master it.”
Gen
4:8  And Qayin told Heḇel his
brother. And it came to be when they were in the field, that Qayin rose up
against Heḇel his brother and killed him. 
Gen
4:9  And יהוה
said to Qayin, “Where is Heḇel your brother?” And he said, “I do not
know. Am I my brother’s guard?” 
Gen
4:10  And He said, “What have you done?
The voice of your brother’s blood cries out to Me from the ground. 
Gen
4:11  “And now you are cursed from the
earth, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your
hand. 
Gen
4:12  “If you till the ground, it shall
no longer yield its strength to you. You shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on
the earth.” 
Gen
4:13  And Qayin said to יהוה,
“My punishment is too great to bear! 
Gen
4:14  “See, You have driven me from the
face of the ground today, and I am hidden from Your face. I shall be a fugitive
and a wanderer on the earth, and it shall be that anyone who finds me kills me.”

Gen
4:15  And יהוה
said to him, “Well, if anyone kills Qayin, vengeance is taken on him sevenfold.”
And יהוה set up a sign for Qayin, lest anyone finding
him kills him. 
Gen
4:16  So Qayin went out from the presence
of יהוה and dwelt in the land of Noḏ on the east
of Ĕḏen. 
Gen
4:17  And Qayin knew his wife, and she
conceived and bore Ḥanoḵ. And he built a city, and called the name
of the city after the name of his son, Ḥanoḵ. 
Gen
4:18  And to Ḥanoḵ was born
Iraḏ. And Iraḏ brought forth Meḥuya’ĕl, and Meḥuya’ĕl
brought forth Methusa’ĕl, and Methusa’ĕl brought forth Lemeḵ. 
Gen
4:19  And Lemeḵ took for himself
two wives, the name of one was Aḏah, and the name of the second was
Tsillah. 
Gen
4:20  And Aḏah bore Yaḇal. He
was the father of those who dwell in tents, with livestock. 
Gen
4:21  And his brother’s name was Yuḇal.
He was the father of all those who play the lyre and flute. 
Gen
4:22  As for Tsillah, she also bore Tuḇal-Qayin,
a smith of all kinds of tools in bronze and iron. And the sister of Tuḇal-Qayin
was Na‛amah. 
Gen
4:23  And Lemeḵ said to his wives, “Aḏah
and Tsillah, hear my voice! Wives of Lemeḵ, listen to my words! For I
have killed a man for wounding me, even a young man for hurting me. 
Gen
4:24  “For Qayin is avenged sevenfold,
and Lemeḵ seventy-sevenfold.” 
Gen
4:25  And Aḏam knew his wife again,
and she bore a son and called his name Shĕth, “For Elohim has appointed me
another seed instead of Heḇel, because Qayin had slain him.” 
Gen
4:26  And to Shĕth, to him also a
son was born. And he called his name Enosh. Then it was begun to call on the
Name of יהוה.
Gen
5:1  This is the book of the genealogy of
Aḏam. In the day that Elohim created man, He made him in the likeness of
Elohim. 
Gen
5:2  Male and female He created them, and
He blessed them, and called their name ‘Aḏam’ in the day they were
created. 
Gen
5:3  And Aḏam lived one hundred and
thirty years, and brought forth a son in his own likeness, after his image, and
called his name Shĕth. 
Gen
5:4  And after he brought forth Shĕth,
the days of Aḏam were eight hundred years. And he brought forth sons and
daughters. 
Gen
5:5  So all the days that Aḏam
lived were nine hundred and thirty years, and he died. 
Gen
5:6  And Shĕth lived one hundred and
five years, and brought forth Enosh. 
Gen
5:7  And after he brought forth Enosh, Shĕth
lived eight hundred and seven years, and brought forth sons and daughters. 
Gen
5:8  So all the days of Shĕth were
nine hundred and twelve years, and he died. 
Gen
5:9  And Enosh lived ninety years, and
brought forth Qĕynan. 
Gen
5:10  And after he brought forth Qĕynan,
Enosh lived eight hundred and fifteen years, and brought forth sons and
daughters. 
Gen
5:11  So all the days of Enosh were nine
hundred and five years, and he died. 
Gen
5:12  And Qĕynan lived seventy
years, and brought forth Mahalal’ĕl. 
Gen
5:13  After he brought forth Mahalal’ĕl,
Qĕynan lived eight hundred and forty years, and brought forth sons and
daughters. 
Gen
5:14  So all the days of Qĕynan were
nine hundred and ten years, and he died. 
Gen
5:15  And Mahalal’ĕl lived
sixty-five years, and brought forth Yereḏ. 
Gen
5:16  And after he brought forth Yereḏ,
Mahalal’ĕl lived eight hundred and thirty years, and brought forth sons
and daughters. 
Gen
5:17  So all the days of Mahalal’ĕl
were eight hundred and ninety-five years, and he died. 
Gen
5:18  And Yereḏ lived one hundred
and sixty-two years, and brought forth Ḥanoḵ. 
Gen
5:19  And after he brought forth Ḥanoḵ,
Yereḏ lived eight hundred years, and brought forth sons and daughters. 
Gen
5:20  So all the days of Yereḏ were
nine hundred and sixty-two years, and he died. 
Gen
5:21  And Ḥanoḵ lived
sixty-five years, and brought forth Methushelaḥ. 
Gen
5:22  And after he brought forth
Methushelaḥ, Ḥanoḵ walked with Elohim three hundred years,
and brought forth sons and daughters. 
Gen
5:23  So all the days of Ḥanoḵ
were three hundred and sixty-five years. 
Gen
5:24  And Ḥanoḵ walked with
Elohim. Then he was no more, for Elohim took him. 
Gen
5:25  And Methushelaḥ lived one
hundred and eighty-seven years, and brought forth Lemeḵ. 
Gen
5:26  And after he brought forth Lemeḵ,
Methushelaḥ lived seven hundred and eighty-two years, and brought forth
sons and daughters. 
Gen
5:27  So all the days of Methushelaḥ
were nine hundred and sixty-nine years, and he died. 
Gen
5:28  And Lemeḵ lived one hundred
and eighty-two years, and brought forth a son, 
Gen
5:29  and called his name Noaḥ,
saying, “This one does comfort us concerning our work and the toil of our
hands, because of the ground which יהוה has cursed.” 
Gen
5:30  And after he brought forth
Noaḥ, Lemeḵ lived five hundred and ninety-five years, and brought
forth sons and daughters. 
Gen
5:31  So all the days of Lemeḵ were
seven hundred and seventy-seven years, and he died. 
Gen
5:32  And Noaḥ was five hundred
years old, and Noaḥ brought forth Shĕm, Ḥam, and Yepheth. 
Gen
6:1  And it came to be, when men began to
increase on the face of the earth, and daughters were born to them, 
Gen
6:2  that the sons of Elohim saw the
daughters of men, that they were good. And they took wives for themselves of
all whom they chose. 
Gen
6:3  And יהוה
said, “My Spirit shall not strive with man forever in his going astray. He is
flesh, and his days shall be one hundred and twenty years.” 
Gen
6:4  The Nephilim were on the earth in
those days, and also afterward, when the sons of Elohim came in to the
daughters of men and they bore children to them. Those were the mighty men who
were of old, the men of name. 
Gen
6:5  And יהוה saw
that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every inclination
of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. 
Gen
6:6  And יהוה was
sorry that He had made man on the earth, and He was grieved in His heart. 
Gen
6:7  And יהוה
said, “I am going to wipe off man whom I have created from the face of the
earth, both man and beast, creeping creature and birds of the heavens, for I am
sorry that I have made them.” 
Gen
6:8  But Noaḥ found favour in the
eyes of יהוה. 
Gen
6:9  This is the genealogy of Noaḥ.
Noaḥ was a righteous man, perfect in his generations. Noaḥ walked
with Elohim. 
Gen
6:10  And Noaḥ brought forth three
sons: Shĕm, Ḥam, and Yepheth. 
Gen
6:11  And the earth was corrupt before
Elohim, and the earth was filled with violence. 
Gen
6:12  And Elohim looked upon the earth
and saw that it was corrupt – for all flesh had corrupted their way on the
earth – 
Gen
6:13  and Elohim said to Noaḥ, “The
end of all flesh has come before Me, for the earth is filled with violence
through them. And see, I am going to destroy them from the earth. 
Gen
6:14  “Make yourself an ark of
gopherwood. Make rooms in the ark, and cover it inside and outside with tar. 
Gen
6:15  “And this is how you are to make
it: The length of the ark is three hundred cubits, its width fifty cubits, and
its height thirty cubits. 
Gen
6:16  “Make a window for the ark, and
complete it to a cubit from above. And set the door of the ark in its side.
Make it with lower, second, and third decks. 
Gen
6:17  “And see, I Myself am bringing
floodwaters on the earth, to destroy all flesh in which is the breath of life
from under the heavens – all that is on the earth is to die. 
Gen
6:18  “And I shall establish My covenant
with you, and you shall come into the ark, you and your sons and your wife and
your sons’ wives with you. 
Gen
6:19  “And of all the living creatures of
all flesh, two of each, you are to bring into the ark, to keep them alive with
you – a male and a female. 
Gen
6:20  “Of the birds after their kind, and
of the cattle after their kind, and of all creeping creatures of the earth
after their kind, two of each are to come to you, to keep them alive. 
Gen
6:21  “As for you, take of all food that
is eaten and gather it to yourself. And it shall be food for you and for them.”

Gen
6:22  And Noaḥ did according to all
that Elohim commanded him, so he did. 
Gen
7:1  And יהוה
said to Noaḥ, “Come into the ark, you and all your household, because I
have seen that you are righteous before Me in this generation. 
Gen
7:2  “Of all the clean beasts take with
you seven pairs, a male and his female; and of the beasts that are unclean two,
a male and his female; 
Gen
7:3  and of birds of the heavens seven
pairs, male and female, to keep offspring alive on the face of all the earth. 
Gen
7:4  “For after seven more days I am
sending rain on the earth, forty days and forty nights, and shall wipe from the
face of the earth all that stand that I created.” 
Gen
7:5  And Noaḥ did according to all
that יהוה commanded him. 
Gen
7:6  Now Noaḥ was six hundred years
old when the flood-waters were on the earth. 
Gen
7:7  And Noaḥ and his sons and his
wife and his sons’ wives went into the ark because of the waters of the flood. 
Gen
7:8  Of the clean beasts and of the
beasts that are unclean, and of birds, and of all that creep on the earth, 
Gen
7:9  two by two they went into the ark to
Noaḥ, male and female, as Elohim had commanded Noaḥ. 
Gen
7:10  And it came to be after seven days
that the waters of the flood were on the earth. 
Gen
7:11  In the six hundredth year of
Noaḥ’s life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, on
that day all the fountains of the great deep were broken up, and the windows of
the heavens were opened. 
Gen
7:12  And the rain was on the earth forty
days and forty nights. 
Gen
7:13  On that same day Noaḥ and Shĕm
and Ḥam and Yepheth, the sons of Noaḥ, and Noaḥ’s wife and
the three wives of his sons with them, went into the ark, 
Gen
7:14  they and every living creature
after its kind, and every beast after its kind, and every creeping creature
that creeps on the earth after its kind, and every bird after its kind, every
bird of every sort. 
Gen
7:15  And they went into the ark to
Noaḥ, two by two, of all flesh in which is the breath of life. 
Gen
7:16  And those going in, male and female
of all flesh, went in as Elohim had commanded him, and יהוה
shut him in. 
Gen
7:17  And the flood was on the earth
forty days, and the waters increased and lifted up the ark, and it rose high
above the earth. 
Gen
7:18  And the waters were mighty and
greatly increased on the earth, and the ark moved about on the surface of the
waters. 
Gen
7:19  And the waters were exceedingly
mighty on the earth, and all the high mountains under all the heavens were covered.

Gen
7:20  The waters became mighty, fifteen
cubits upward, and the mountains were covered. 
Gen
7:21  And all flesh died that moved on
the earth – birds and cattle and beasts and every creeping creature that creeps
on the earth, and all mankind. 
Gen
7:22  All in whose nostrils was the
breath of the spirit of life, all that was on the dry land, died. 
Gen
7:23  So He wiped off all that stand,
which were on the face of the ground – both man and beast, creeping creature
and bird of the heavens. And they were wiped off from the earth. And only
Noaḥ was left, and those with him in the ark. 
Gen
7:24  And the waters were mighty on the
earth, one hundred and fifty days. 
Gen
8:1  And Elohim remembered Noaḥ,
and all the beasts and all the cattle that were with him in the ark. And Elohim
made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters subsided. 
Gen
8:2  And the fountains of the deep and
the windows of the heavens were stopped, and the rain from the heavens was
withheld. 
Gen
8:3  And the waters receded steadily from
the earth, and at the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters diminished. 
Gen
8:4  And in the seventh month, the
seventeenth day of the month, the ark rested on the mountains of Ararat. 
Gen
8:5  And the waters decreased steadily
until the tenth month. In the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the
tops of the mountains became visible. 
Gen
8:6  And it came to be, at the end of
forty days, that Noaḥ opened the window of the ark which he had made, 
Gen
8:7  and he sent out a raven, which kept
going out and turning back until the waters had dried up from the earth. 
Gen
8:8  Then he sent out a dove from him, to
see if the waters had receded from the face of the ground. 
Gen
8:9  But the dove found no resting place
for its feet and returned into the ark to him, for the waters were on the face
of all the earth. So he put out his hand and took it, and pulled it into the
ark to himself. 
Gen
8:10  And he waited yet another seven
days, and again he sent the dove out from the ark. 
Gen
8:11  And the dove came to him in the
evening, and see, a freshly plucked olive leaf was in its mouth. And Noaḥ
knew that the waters had receded from the earth. 
Gen
8:12  And he waited yet another seven
days and sent out the dove, which did not return to him again. 
Gen
8:13  And it came to be in the six
hundred and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, that
the waters were dried up from the earth. And Noaḥ removed the covering of
the ark and looked, and saw the surface of the ground was dry. 
Gen
8:14  And in the second month, on the
twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dry. 
Gen
8:15  And Elohim spoke to Noaḥ,
saying, 
Gen
8:16  “Go out of the ark, you and your
wife and your sons and your sons’ wives with you. 
Gen
8:17  “Bring out with you every living
creature of all flesh that is with you: of birds, of cattle and all creeping
creatures that creep on the earth. And let them teem on the earth, and bear and
increase on the earth.” 
Gen
8:18  So Noaḥ went out, and his
sons and his wife and his sons’ wives with him, 
Gen
8:19  every beast, every creeping
creature, and every bird, whatever creeps on the earth, according to their
kinds, went out of the ark. 
Gen
8:20  And Noaḥ built an altar to יהוה,
and took of every clean beast and of every clean bird, and offered burnt
offerings on the altar. 
Gen
8:21  And יהוה
smelled a soothing fragrance, and יהוה said in His
heart, “Never again shall I curse the ground because of man, although the
inclination of man’s heart is evil from his youth, and never again smite all
living creatures, as I have done, 
Gen
8:22  as long as the earth remains,
seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and winter and summer, and day and
night shall not cease.” 
Gen
9:1  And Elohim blessed Noaḥ and
his sons, and said to them, “Bear fruit and increase, and fill the earth. 
Gen
9:2  “And the fear of you and the dread
of you is on every beast of the earth, on every bird of the heavens, on all
that creeps on the ground, and on all the fish of the sea – into your hand they
have been given. 
Gen
9:3  “Every moving creature that lives is
food for you. I have given you all, as I
gave the green plants. 
Gen
9:4  “But do not eat flesh with its life,
its blood. 
Gen
9:5  “But only your blood for your lives
I require, from the hand of every beast I require it, and from the hand of man.
From the hand of every man’s brother I require the life of man. 
Gen
9:6  “Whoever sheds man’s blood, by man
his blood is shed, for in the image of Elohim has He made man. 
Gen
9:7  “As for you, bear fruit and
increase, bring forth teemingly in the earth and increase in it.” 
Gen
9:8  And Elohim spoke to Noaḥ and
to his sons with him, saying, 
Gen
9:9  “And I, see, I establish My covenant
with you and with your seed after you, 
Gen
9:10  and with every living creature that
is with you: of the birds, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with
you, of all that go out of the ark, every beast of the earth. 
Gen
9:11  “And I shall establish My covenant
with you, and never again is all flesh cut off by the waters of the flood, and
never again is there a flood to destroy the earth.” 
Gen
9:12  And Elohim said, “This is the sign
of the covenant which I make between Me and you, and every living creature that
is with you, for all generations to come: 
Gen
9:13  “I shall set My rainbow in the
cloud, and it shall be for the sign of the covenant between Me and the earth. 
Gen
9:14  “And it shall be, when I bring a
cloud over the earth, that the rainbow shall be seen in the cloud, 
Gen
9:15  and I shall remember My covenant
which is between Me and you and every living creature of all flesh, and never
again let the waters become a flood to destroy all flesh. 
Gen
9:16  “And the rainbow shall be in the
cloud, and I shall see it, to remember the everlasting covenant between Elohim
and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth.” 
Gen
9:17  And Elohim said to Noaḥ, “This
is the sign of the covenant which I have established between Me and all flesh
that is on the earth.” 
Gen
9:18  And the sons of Noaḥ who went
out of the ark were Shĕm and Ḥam and Yepheth. And Ḥam was the
father of Kena‛an. 
Gen
9:19  These three were the sons of
Noaḥ, and all the earth was overspread from them. 
Gen
9:20  And Noaḥ, a man of the soil,
began and planted a vineyard. 
Gen
9:21  And he drank of the wine and was
drunk, and became uncovered in his tent. 
Gen
9:22  And Ḥam, the father of Kena‛an,
saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brothers outside. 
Gen
9:23  So Shĕm and Yepheth took a
garment, laid it on both their shoulders, and went backward and covered the
nakedness of their father, but their faces were turned away, and they did not
see their father’s nakedness. 
Gen
9:24  And Noaḥ awoke from his wine,
and he knew what his younger son had done to him, 
Gen
9:25  and he said, “Cursed is Kena‛an,
let him become a servant of servants to his brothers.” 
Gen
9:26  And he said, “Blessed be יהוה,
the Elohim of Shĕm, and let Kena‛an become his servant. 
Gen
9:27  “Let Elohim enlarge Yepheth, and let
him dwell in the tents of Shĕm. And let Kena‛an become his servant.”

Gen
9:28  And Noaḥ lived after the
flood three hundred and fifty years. 
Gen
9:29  So all the days of Noaḥ were
nine hundred and fifty years, and he died. 
Gen
10:1  And this is the genealogy of the
sons of Noaḥ: Shĕm, Ḥam, and Yepheth. And sons were born to
them after the flood. 
Gen
10:2  The sons of Yepheth: Gomer, and Maḡoḡ,
and Maḏai, and Yawan, and Tuḇal, and Mesheḵ, and Tiras. 
Gen
10:3  And the sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz,
and Riphath, and Toḡarmah. 
Gen
10:4  And the sons of Yawan: Elishah and
Tarshish, Kittim and Doḏanim. 
Gen
10:5  From these the coastland peoples of
the nations were separated into their lands, everyone according to his
language, according to their clans, into their nations. 
Gen
10:6  And the sons of Ḥam: Kush,
and Mitsrayim, and Put, and Kena‛an. 
Gen
10:7  And the sons of Kush: Seḇa,
and Ḥawilah, and Saḇtah, and Ra‛mah, and Saḇteḵa.
And the sons of Ra‛mah: Sheḇa and Deḏan. 
Gen
10:8  And Kush brought forth Nimroḏ,
he began to be a mighty one on the earth. 
Gen
10:9  He was a mighty hunter before יהוה,
therefore it is said, “Like Nimroḏ the mighty hunter before יהוה.”

Gen
10:10  And the beginning of his reign was
Baḇel, and Ereḵ, and Akkaḏ, and Kalnĕh, in the land of
Shin‛ar. 
Gen
10:11  From that land he went to Ashshur
and built Ninewĕh, and Reḥoḇoth Ir, and Kelaḥ, 
Gen
10:12  and Resen between Ninewĕh and
Kelaḥ, the great city. 
Gen
10:13  And Mitsrayim brought forth Luḏim,
and Anamim, and Lehaḇim, and Naphtuḥim, 
Gen
10:14  and Pathrusim, and Kasluḥim,
from whom came the Philistines and Kaphtorim. 
Gen
10:15  And Kena‛an brought forth
Tsiḏon his first-born, and Ḥĕth, 
Gen
10:16  and the Yeḇusite, and the
Amorite, and the Girgashite, 
Gen
10:17  and the Ḥiwwite, and the
Arqite, and the Sinite, 
Gen
10:18  and the Arwaḏite, and the
Tsemarite, and the Ḥamathite. And afterward the clans of the Kena‛anites
were spread abroad. 
Gen
10:19  And the border of the Kena‛anites
was from Tsiḏon as you go toward Gerar, as far as Azzah, as you go toward
Seḏom, and Amorah, and Aḏmah, and Tseḇoyim, as far as Lasha. 
Gen
10:20  These were the sons of Ḥam,
according to their clans, according to their languages, in their lands, in
their nations. 
Gen
10:21  And also to Shĕm, the father
of all the children of Ĕḇer, the brother of Yepheth the elder, children were born. 
Gen
10:22  The sons of Shĕm: Ĕylam,
and Asshur, and Arpaḵshaḏ, and Luḏ, and Aram. 
Gen
10:23  And the sons of Aram: Uts, and Ḥul,
and Gether, and Mash. 
Gen
10:24  And Arpaḵshaḏ brought
forth Shelaḥ, and Shelaḥ brought forth Ĕḇer. 
Gen
10:25  And to Ĕḇer were born
two sons, the name of one was Peleḡ, for in his days the earth was
divided, and his brother’s name was Yoqtan. 
Gen
10:26  And Yoqtan brought forth Almoḏaḏ,
and Sheleph, and Ḥatsarmaweth, and Yeraḥ, 
Gen
10:27  and Haḏoram, and Uzal, and
Diqlah, 
Gen
10:28  and Oḇal, and Aḇima’ĕl,
and Sheḇa, 
Gen
10:29  and Ophir, and Ḥawilah, and
Yoḇaḇ. All these were sons of Yoqtan. 
Gen
10:30  And their dwelling place was from
Mĕysha as you go toward Sephar, a mountain of the east. 
Gen
10:31  These were the sons of Shĕm,
according to their clans, according to their languages, in their lands,
according to their nations. 
Gen
10:32  These were the clans of the sons
of Noaḥ, according to their generations, in their nations. And from these
the nations were divided on the earth after the flood. 
Gen
11:1  And all the earth had one language
and one speech.
Gen
11:2  And it came to be, as they set out
from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shin‛ar, and they
dwelt there.
Gen
11:3  And they said to each other, “Come,
let us make bricks and bake them thoroughly.” And they had brick for stone, and
they had asphalt for mortar. 
Gen
11:4  And they said, “Come, let us build
ourselves a city, and a tower whose top is in the heavens, and make a name for
ourselves, lest we be scattered over all the face of the earth.” 
Gen
11:5  Then יהוה
came down to see the city and the tower which the sons of men had built. 
Gen
11:6  And יהוה
said, “Look, they are one people and they all have one language, and this is
what they begin to do! And now, they are not going to be withheld from doing
whatever they plan to do. 
Gen
11:7  “Come, let Us go there and confuse
their language, so that they do not understand one another’s speech.” 
Gen
11:8  And יהוה
scattered them from there, over the face of all the earth, and they left off
building the city. 
Gen
11:9  That is why its name was called Baḇel,
because there יהוה confused the language of all the
earth, and from there יהוה scattered them over the face
of all the earth.
Gen
11:10  This is the genealogy of Shĕm:
Shĕm was a hundred years old and brought forth Arpaḵshaḏ, two
years after the flood. 
Gen
11:11  And after he brought forth Arpaḵshaḏ,
Shĕm lived five hundred years, and brought forth sons and daughters. 
Gen
11:12  And Arpaḵshaḏ lived
thirty-five years, and brought forth Shelaḥ. 
Gen
11:13  And after he brought forth
Shelaḥ, Arpaḵshaḏ lived four hundred and three years, and
brought forth sons and daughters. 
Gen
11:14  And Shelaḥ lived thirty
years, and brought forth Ĕḇer. 
Gen
11:15  And after he brought forth Ĕḇer,
Shelaḥ lived four hundred and three years, and brought forth sons and
daughters. 
Gen
11:16  And Ĕḇer lived
thirty-four years, and brought forth Peleḡ. 
Gen
11:17  And after he brought forth Peleḡ,
Ĕḇer lived four hundred and thirty years, and brought forth sons and
daughters. 
Gen
11:18  And Peleḡ lived thirty
years, and brought forth Re‛u. 
Gen
11:19  And after he brought forth Re‛u,
Peleḡ lived two hundred and nine years, and brought forth sons and
daughters. 
Gen
11:20  And Re‛u lived thirty-two
years, and brought forth Seruḡ. 
Gen
11:21  And after he brought forth Seruḡ,
Re‛u lived two hundred and seven years, and brought forth sons and
daughters. 
Gen
11:22  And Seruḡ lived thirty
years, and brought forth Naḥor. 
Gen
11:23  And after he brought forth
Naḥor, Seruḡ lived two hundred years, and brought forth sons and
daughters. 
Gen
11:24  And Naḥor lived twenty-nine
years, and brought forth Teraḥ. 
Gen
11:25  And after he brought forth
Teraḥ, Naḥor lived one hundred and nineteen years, and brought
forth sons and daughters. 
Gen
11:26  And Teraḥ lived seventy
years, and brought forth Aḇram, Naḥor, and Haran. 
Gen
11:27  And this is the genealogy of
Teraḥ: Teraḥ brought forth Aḇram, Naḥor, and Haran. And
Haran brought forth Lot. 
Gen
11:28  And Haran died before his father
Teraḥ in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldeans. 
Gen
11:29  And Aḇram and Naḥor
took wives: the name of Aḇram’s wife was Sarai, and the name of
Naḥor’s wife, Milkah, the daughter of Haran the father of Milkah and the
father of Yiskah. 
Gen
11:30  And Sarai was barren, she had no
child. 
Gen
11:31  And Teraḥ took his son Aḇram
and his grandson Lot, son of Haran, and his daughter-in-law Sarai, his son Aḇram’s
wife, and they went out with them from Ur of the Chaldeans to go to the land of
Kena‛an. And they came to Ḥaran and dwelt there. 
Gen
11:32  And the days of Teraḥ came
to be two hundred and five years, and Teraḥ died in Ḥaran. 
Gen
12:1  And יהוה
said to Aḇram, “Go yourself out of your land, from your relatives and
from your father’s house, to a land which I show you. 
Gen
12:2  “And I shall make you a great
nation, and bless you and make your name great, and you shall be a blessing! 
Gen
12:3  “And I shall bless those who bless
you, and curse him who curses you. And in you all the clans of the earth shall
be blessed.” 
Gen
12:4  So Aḇram left, as יהוה
had commanded him, and Lot went with him. And Aḇram was seventy-five
years old when he set out from Ḥaran. 
Gen
12:5  And Aḇram took Sarai his wife
and Lot his brother’s son, and all their possessions that they had gathered,
and the beings whom they had acquired in Ḥaran, and they set out for the
land of Kena‛an. And they came to the land of Kena‛an. 
Gen
12:6  And Aḇram passed through the
land to the place of Sheḵem, as far as the terebinth tree of Moreh. At
that time the Kena‛anites were in the land. 
Gen
12:7  And יהוה
appeared to Aḇram and said, “To your seed I give this land.” And he built
there an altar to יהוה, who had appeared to him. 
Gen
12:8  And from there he moved to the
mountain east of Bĕyth Ĕl, and he pitched his tent, with Bĕyth Ĕl
on the west and Ai on the east. And he built there an altar to יהוה,
and called on the Name of יהוה. 
Gen
12:9  And Aḇram set out, continuing
toward the South. 
Gen
12:10  And a scarcity of food came to be
in the land, and Aḇram went down to Mitsrayim to dwell there, for the
scarcity of food was severe in the land. 
Gen
12:11  And it came to be, when he was
close to entering Mitsrayim, that he said to Sarai his wife, “See, I know that
you are a fair woman to look at. 
Gen
12:12  “And it shall be, when the
Mitsrites see you, that they shall say, ‘This is his wife.’ And they shall kill
me, but let you live. 
Gen
12:13  “Please say you are my sister, so
that it shall be well with me for your sake, and my life be spared because of
you.” 
Gen
12:14  And it came to be, when Aḇram
came into Mitsrayim, that the Mitsrites saw the woman, that she was very fair. 
Gen
12:15  And Pharaoh’s officials saw her
and praised her before Pharaoh, and the woman was taken to Pharaoh’s house. 
Gen
12:16  And he treated Aḇram well
for her sake, and he had sheep, and cattle, and male donkeys, and male and
female servants, and female donkeys, and camels. 
Gen
12:17  But יהוה
plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Aḇram’s
wife. 
Gen
12:18  And Pharaoh called Aḇram and
said, “What is this you have done to me? Why did you not inform me that she was
your wife? 
Gen
12:19  “Why did you say, ‘She is my
sister’? And so I was going to take her for my wife. Look, here is your wife,
take her and go.” 
Gen
12:20  And Pharaoh commanded his men
concerning him, and they sent him away, with his wife and all that he had. 
Gen
13:1  And Aḇram went up from
Mitsrayim into the South, he and his wife and all that he had, and Lot with
him. 
Gen
13:2  And Aḇram was very rich in
livestock, in silver, and in gold. 
Gen
13:3  And he went on his journey from the
South as far as Bĕyth Ĕl, to the place where his tent had been at the
beginning, between Bĕyth Ĕl and Ai, 
Gen
13:4  to the place of the altar which he
had made there at first. And there Aḇram called on the Name of יהוה.

Gen
13:5  Now Lot, who went with Aḇram,
also had flocks and herds and tents. 
Gen
13:6  And the land was not able to bear
them, that they might dwell together, for their possessions were great, so that
they could not dwell together. 
Gen
13:7  And there was strife between the
herdsmen of Aḇram’s livestock and the herdsmen of Lot’s livestock. And at
that time the Kena‛anites and the Perizzites dwelt in the land. 
Gen
13:8  Then Aḇram said to Lot, “Please
let there be no strife between you and me, and between my herdsmen and your
herdsmen, for we are brothers. 
Gen
13:9  “Is not all the land before you?
Please separate from me. If you take the left, then I go to the right; or, if
you go to the right, then I go to the left.” 
Gen
13:10  And Lot lifted his eyes and saw
all the plain of the Yardĕn, that it was well watered everywhere – before יהוה
destroyed Seḏom and Amorah – like the garden of יהוה,
like the land of Mitsrayim as you go toward Tso‛ar. 
Gen
13:11  So Lot chose for himself all the
plain of the Yardĕn, and Lot moved east. Thus they separated from each
other, 
Gen
13:12  Aḇram dwelling in the land
of Kena‛an, and Lot dwelling in the cities of the plain and pitched his
tent as far as Seḏom. 
Gen
13:13  But the men of Seḏom were
evil and sinned before יהוה, exceedingly so. 
Gen
13:14  And after Lot had separated from
him, יהוה said to Aḇram, “Now lift up your eyes
and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and
westward, 
Gen
13:15  for all the land which you see I
shall give to you and your seed forever. 
Gen
13:16  “And I shall make your seed as the
dust of the earth, so that, if a man could count the dust of the earth, then
your seed also could be counted. 
Gen
13:17  “Arise, walk in the land through
its length and its width, for I give it to you.” 
Gen
13:18  So Aḇram moved his tent, and
went and dwelt by the terebinth trees of Mamrĕ, which are in Ḥeḇron,
and built an altar there to יהוה. 
Gen
14:1  And it came to be in the days of
Amraphel sovereign of Shin‛ar, Aryoḵ sovereign of Ellasar, Keḏorla‛omer
sovereign of Ĕylam, and Tiḏ‛al sovereign of Goyim, 
Gen
14:2  that they fought against Bera
sovereign of Seḏom, Birsha sovereign of Amorah, Shinaḇ sovereign of
Aḏmah, Shem’ĕḇer sovereign of Tseḇoyim, and the
sovereign of Bela, that is Tso‛ar. 
Gen
14:3  All these joined together in the
Valley of Siddim, that is the Salt Sea. 
Gen
14:4  Twelve years they served Keḏorla‛omer,
and in the thirteenth year they rebelled. 
Gen
14:5  And in the fourteenth year Keḏorla‛omer
and the sovereigns that were with him came and smote the Repha’im in Ashteroth
Qarnayim, and the Zuzim in Ḥam, and the Ĕmites in Shawĕh
Qiryathayim, 
Gen
14:6  and the Ḥorites in their
mountain of Sĕ‛ir, as far as Ĕl Paran, which is by the
wilderness. 
Gen
14:7  And they turned back and came to Ĕn
Mishpat, that is Qaḏĕsh, and smote all the country of the Amalĕqites,
and also the Amorites who dwelt in Ḥatsetson Tamar. 
Gen
14:8  And the sovereign of Seḏom, and
the sovereign of Amorah, and the sovereign of Aḏmah, and the sovereign of
Tseḇoyim, and the sovereign of Bela, that is Tso‛ar, went out and
joined together in battle in the Valley of Siddim, 
Gen
14:9  against Keḏorla‛omer
sovereign of Ĕylam, and Tiḏ‛al sovereign of Goyim, and
Amraphel sovereign of Shin‛ar, and Aryoḵ sovereign of Ellasar –
four sovereigns against five. 
Gen
14:10  And the Valley of Siddim had many
tar pits. And the sovereigns of Seḏom and Amorah fled and fell there, and
the remainder fled to the mountains. 
Gen
14:11  And they took all the goods of Seḏom
and Amorah, and all their food, and went away. 
Gen
14:12  And they took Lot, Aḇram’s
brother’s son who dwelt in Seḏom, and his goods, and left. 
Gen
14:13  And one who had escaped came and
informed Aḇram the Heḇrew, for he dwelt by the terebinth trees of
Mamrĕ the Amorite, brother of Eshkol and brother of Anĕr, and they
had a covenant with Aḇram. 
Gen
14:14  And when Aḇram heard that
his brother was taken captive, he armed his three hundred and eighteen trained
servants who were born in his own house, and went in pursuit as far as Dan. 
Gen
14:15  And he and his servants divided
against them by night, and smote them and pursued them as far as Ḥoḇah,
which is on the left of Damascus. 
Gen
14:16  So he brought back all the goods,
and also brought back his brother Lot and his goods, as well as the women and
the people. 
Gen
14:17  And after his return from the
defeat of Keḏorla‛omer and the sovereigns who were with him, the
sovereign of Seḏom came out to meet him at the Valley of Shawĕh,
that is, the Sovereign’s Valley. 
Gen
14:18  And Malkitseḏeq sovereign of
Shalĕm brought out bread and wine. Now he was the priest of the Most High Ĕl.

Gen
14:19  And he blessed him and said, “Blessed
be Aḇram of the Most High Ĕl, Possessor of the heavens and earth. 
Gen
14:20  “And blessed be the Most High Ĕl
who has delivered your enemies into your hand.” And he gave him a tenth of all.

Gen
14:21  And the sovereign of Seḏom
said to Aḇram, “Give me the people, and take the goods for yourself.” 
Gen
14:22  But Aḇram said to the
sovereign of Seḏom, “I have lifted my hand to יהוה,
the Most High Ĕl, the Possessor of the heavens and earth, 
Gen
14:23  not to take a thread or a sandal
strap or whatever is yours, lest you should say, ‘I have made Aḇram rich,’

Gen
14:24  except only what the young men
have eaten, and the portion of the men who went with me: Anĕr, Eshkol, and
Mamrĕ. Let them take their portion.” 
Gen
15:1  After these events the word of יהוה
came to Aḇram in a vision, saying, “Do not be afraid, Aḇram. I am
your shield, your reward is exceedingly great.” 
Gen
15:2  And Aḇram said, “Master יהוה,
what would You give me, seeing I go childless, and the heir of my house is Eli‛ezer
of Damascus?” 
Gen
15:3  And Aḇram said, “See, You
have given me no seed, and see, one born in my house is my heir!” 
Gen
15:4  And see, the word of יהוה
came to him, saying, “This one is not your heir, but he who comes from your own
body is your heir.” 
Gen
15:5  And He brought him outside and
said, “Look now toward the heavens, and count the stars if you are able to
count them.” And He said to him, “So are your seed.” 
Gen
15:6  And he believed in יהוה,
and He reckoned it to him for righteousness. 
Gen
15:7  And He said to him, “I am יהוה,
who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give you this land to inherit
it.” 
Gen
15:8  And he said, “Master יהוה,
whereby do I know that I possess it?” 
Gen
15:9  And He said to him, “Bring Me a
three-year-old heifer, and a three-year-old female goat, and a three-year-old
ram, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.” 
Gen
15:10  And he took all these to Him and
cut them in the middle, and placed each half opposite the other, but he did not
cut the birds. 
Gen
15:11  And the birds of prey came down on
the carcasses, and Aḇram drove them away. 
Gen
15:12  And it came to be, when the sun
was going down, and a deep sleep fell upon Aḇram, that see, a frightening
great darkness fell upon him. 
Gen
15:13  And He said to Aḇram, “Know
for certain that your seed are to be sojourners in a land that is not theirs,
and shall serve them, and they shall afflict them four hundred years. 
Gen
15:14  “But the nation whom they serve I
am going to judge, and afterward let them come out with great possessions. 
Gen
15:15  “Now as for you, you are to go to
your fathers in peace, you are to be buried at a good old age. 
Gen
15:16  “Then, in the fourth generation
they shall return here, for the crookedness of the Amorites is not yet
complete.” 
Gen
15:17  And it came to be, when the sun
went down and it was dark, that see, a smoking oven and a burning torch passing
between those pieces. 
Gen
15:18  On the same day יהוה
made a covenant with Aḇram, saying, “I have given this land to your seed,
from the river of Mitsrayim to the great river, the River Euphrates, 
Gen
15:19  with the Qĕynite, and the
Qenizzite, and the Qaḏmonite, 
Gen
15:20  and the Ḥittite, and the
Perizzite, and the Repha’im, 
Gen
15:21  and the Amorite, and the Kena‛anite,
and the Girgashite, and the Yeḇusite.” 
Gen
16:1  And Sarai, Aḇram’s wife, had
borne him no child. And she had a Mitsrite female servant whose name was Haḡar.

Gen
16:2  And Sarai said to Aḇram, “See,
יהוה has kept me from bearing children. Please, go in
to my female servant. It might be that I am built up by her.” And Aḇram
listened to the voice of Sarai. 
Gen
16:3  And Sarai, Aḇram’s wife, took
Haḡar her female servant, the Mitsrite, and gave her to her husband Aḇram
to be his wife, after Aḇram had dwelt ten years in the land of Kena‛an.

Gen
16:4  And he went in to Haḡar, and
she conceived. And when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was
despised in her eyes. 
Gen
16:5  And Sarai said to Aḇram, “My
wrong be upon you! I gave my female servant into your bosom. And when she saw
that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes. Let יהוה
judge between you and me.” 
Gen
16:6  And Aḇram said to Sarai, “See,
your female servant is in your hand, do to her what is good in your eyes.” And
Sarai treated her harshly, and she fled from her presence. 
Gen
16:7  And the Messenger of יהוה
found her by a spring of water in the wilderness, by the spring on the way to
Shur, 
Gen
16:8  and He said, “Haḡar, Sarai’s
female servant, where have you come from, and where are you going?” And she
said, “I am fleeing from the presence of Sarai, my mistress.” 
Gen
16:9  And the Messenger of יהוה
said to her, “Return to your mistress, and humble yourself under her hand.” 
Gen
16:10  And the Messenger of יהוה
said to her, “I am going to increase your seed greatly, too numerous to be
counted.” 
Gen
16:11  And the Messenger of יהוה
said to her, “See, you are conceiving and bearing a son, and shall call his
name Yishma‛ĕl, because יהוה has heard your
affliction. 
Gen
16:12  “And he is to be a wild man, his
hand against every one and every one’s hand against him, and dwell over against
all his brothers.” 
Gen
16:13  And she called the Name of יהוה
who spoke to her, “You are the Ĕl who sees,” for she said, “Even here have
I seen after Him who sees me?” 
Gen
16:14  That is why the well was called Be’ĕr
Laḥai Ro’i, see, it is between Qaḏĕsh and Bereḏ. 
Gen
16:15  And Haḡar bore Aḇram a
son, and Aḇram called the name of his son, whom Haḡar bore, Yishma‛ĕl.
Gen
16:16  And Aḇram was eighty-six
years old when Haḡar bore Yishma‛ĕl to Aḇram.
Gen
17:1  And it came to be when Aḇram
was ninety-nine years old, that יהוה appeared to Aḇram
and said to him, “I am Ĕl Shaddai – walk before Me and be perfect.
Gen
17:2  “And I give My covenant between Me
and you, and shall greatly increase you.” 
Gen
17:3  And Aḇram fell on his face,
and Elohim spoke with him, saying, 
Gen
17:4  “As for Me, look, My covenant is
with you, and you shall become a father of many nations. 
Gen
17:5  “And no longer is your name called
Aḇram, but your name shall be Aḇraham, because I shall make you a
father of many nations. 
Gen
17:6  “And I shall make you bear fruit
exceedingly, and make nations of you, and sovereigns shall come from you. 
Gen
17:7  “And I shall establish My covenant
between Me and you and your seed after you in their generations, for an
everlasting covenant, to be Elohim to you and your seed after you. 
Gen
17:8  “And I shall give to you and your
seed after you the land of your sojournings, all the land of Kena‛an, as
an everlasting possession. And I shall be their Elohim.” 
Gen
17:9  And Elohim said to Aḇraham, “As
for you, guard My covenant, you and your seed after you throughout their
generations. 
Gen
17:10  “This is My covenant which you
guard between Me and you, and your seed after you: Every male child among you
is to be circumcised. 
Gen
17:11  “And you shall circumcise the
flesh of your foreskin, and it shall become a sign of the covenant between Me
and you. 
Gen
17:12  “And a son of eight days is
circumcised by you, every male child in your generations, he who is born in
your house or bought with silver from any foreigner who is not of your seed. 
Gen
17:13  “He who is born in your house, and
he who is bought with your silver, has to be circumcised. So shall My covenant
be in your flesh, for an everlasting covenant. 
Gen
17:14  “And an uncircumcised male child,
who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, his life shall be cut off
from his people – he has broken My covenant.” 
Gen
17:15  And Elohim said to Aḇraham, “As
for Sarai your wife, do not call her name Sarai, for Sarah is her name. 
Gen
17:16  “And I shall bless her and also
give you a son by her. And I shall bless her, and she shall become nations –
sovereigns of peoples are to be from her.” 
Gen
17:17  And Aḇraham fell on his face
and laughed, and said in his heart, “Is a child
born to a man who is a hundred years old? Or is Sarah, who is ninety years old,
to bear a child?” 
Gen
17:18  And Aḇraham said to Elohim, “Oh,
let Yishma‛ĕl live before You!” 
Gen
17:19  And Elohim said, “No, Sarah your
wife is truly bearing a son to you, and you shall call his name Yitsḥaq.
And I shall establish My covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and
with his seed after him. 
Gen
17:20  “And as for Yishma‛ĕl,
I have heard you. See, I shall bless him, and shall make him bear fruit, and
greatly increase him. He is to bring forth twelve princes, and I shall make him
a great nation. 
Gen
17:21  “But My covenant I establish with
Yitsḥaq, whom Sarah is to bear to you at this set time next year.” 
Gen
17:22  And when He had ended speaking
with him, Elohim went up from Aḇraham. 
Gen
17:23  And Aḇraham took Yishma‛ĕl
his son, and all those born in his house and all those bought with his silver,
every male among the men of Aḇraham’s house, and circumcised the flesh of
their foreskins that same day, as Elohim told him. 
Gen
17:24  And Aḇraham was ninety-nine
years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. 
Gen
17:25  And Yishma‛ĕl his son
was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. 
Gen
17:26  Aḇraham and his son Yishma‛ĕl
were circumcised that same day. 
Gen
17:27  And all the men of his house, born
in the house or bought with silver from a foreigner, were circumcised with him.

Gen
18:1  And יהוה
appeared to him by the terebinth trees of Mamrĕ, while he was sitting in
the tent door in the heat of the day. 
Gen
18:2  So he lifted his eyes and looked,
and saw three men standing opposite him. And when he saw them, he ran from the
tent door to meet them, and bowed himself to the ground, 
Gen
18:3  and said, “ יהוה,
if I have now found favour in Your eyes, please do not pass Your servant by. 
Gen
18:4  “Please let a little water be
brought, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree. 
Gen
18:5  “And let me bring a piece of bread
and refresh your hearts, and then go on, for this is why you have come to your
servant.” And they said, “Do as you have said.” 
Gen
18:6  So Aḇraham ran into the tent
to Sarah and said, “Hurry, make ready three measures of fine flour, knead it
and make cakes.” 
Gen
18:7  And Aḇraham ran to the herd,
took a tender and good calf, gave it to a young man, and he hurried to prepare
it. 
Gen
18:8  And he took curds and milk and the
calf which he had prepared, and set it before them, and he stood by them under
the tree as they ate. 
Gen
18:9  And they said to him, “Where is
Sarah your wife?” And he said, “See, in the tent.” 
Gen
18:10  And He said, “I shall certainly
return to you according to the time of life, and see, Sarah your wife is to
have a son!” And Sarah was listening in the tent door which was behind him. 
Gen
18:11  Now Aḇraham and Sarah were
old, well advanced in age, and Sarah was past the way of women. 
Gen
18:12  And Sarah laughed within herself,
saying, “After I have grown old, shall I have pleasure, my master being old
too?” 
Gen
18:13  And יהוה
said to Aḇraham, “Why did Sarah laugh, saying, ‘Shall I truly have a
child, since I am old?’ 
Gen
18:14  “Is any matter too hard for יהוה
? At the appointed time I am going to return to you, according to the time of
life, and Sarah is to have a son.” 
Gen
18:15  But Sarah denied it, saying, “I
did not laugh,” for she was afraid. And He said, “No, but you did laugh!” 
Gen
18:16  And the men rose up from there and
looked toward Seḏom, and Aḇraham went with them to send them away. 
Gen
18:17  And יהוה
said, “Shall I hide from Aḇraham what I am doing, 
Gen
18:18  since Aḇraham is certainly
going to become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth
shall be blessed in him? 
Gen
18:19  “For I have known him, so that he
commands his children and his household after him, to guard the way of יהוה,
to do righteousness and right-ruling, so that יהוה
brings to Aḇraham what He has spoken to him.” 
Gen
18:20  And יהוה
said, “Because the outcry against Seḏom and Amorah is great, and because
their sin is very heavy, 
Gen
18:21  “I am going down now to see
whether they have done altogether according to the outcry against it that has
come to Me, and if not, I know.” 
Gen
18:22  So the men turned away from there
and went toward Seḏom, but יהוה still stood
before Aḇraham. 
Gen
18:23  And Aḇraham drew near and
said, “Would You also destroy the righteous with the wrong? 
Gen
18:24  “Suppose there are fifty righteous
within the city, would You also destroy the place and not spare it for the
fifty righteous that were in it? 
Gen
18:25  “Far be it from You to act in this
way, to slay the righteous with the wrong, so that the righteous should be as
the wrong. Far be it from You! Does the Judge of all the earth not do right?” 
Gen
18:26  And יהוה
said, “If I find in Seḏom fifty righteous within the city, then I shall
spare all the place for their sakes.” 
Gen
18:27  And Aḇraham answered and
said, “Look, please, I who am but dust and ashes have taken it upon myself to
speak to יהוה, 
Gen
18:28  “Suppose there are five less than
the fifty righteous, would You destroy all of the city for lack of five?” And
He said, “If I find there forty-five, I do not destroy it.” 
Gen
18:29  And he spoke to Him yet again and
said, “Suppose there are found forty?” And He said, “I would not do it for the
sake of forty.” 
Gen
18:30  And he said, “Let not יהוה
be displeased, and let me speak: Suppose there are found thirty?” And He said, “I
would not do it if I find thirty there.” 
Gen
18:31  And he said, “Look, please, I have
taken it upon myself to speak to יהוה : Suppose there
are found twenty?” And He said, “I would not destroy it for the sake of twenty.”

Gen
18:32  And he said, “Let not יהוה
be displeased, and let me speak only this time: Suppose there are found ten?”
And He said, “I would not destroy it for the sake of ten.” 
Gen
18:33  Then יהוה
went away as soon as He had ended speaking to Aḇraham. And Aḇraham
returned to his place. 
Gen
19:1  And the two messengers came to Seḏom
in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the gate of Seḏom. And when Lot
saw them, he rose up to meet them, and he bowed himself with his face toward
the ground, 
Gen
19:2  and he said, “Look, please my
masters, please turn in to your servant’s house and spend the night, and wash
your feet, and rise early and go your way.” And they said, “No, but let us
spend the night in the open square.” 
Gen
19:3  But he urged them strongly, and
they turned in to him and came into his house. And he made them a feast, and
baked unleavened bread, and they ate. 
Gen
19:4  Before they lay down, the men of
the city, the men of Seḏom, both old and young, all the people from every
part, surrounded the house. 
Gen
19:5  And they called to Lot and said to
him, “Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us, and let
us ‘know’ them.” 
Gen
19:6  So Lot went out to them through the
doorway, and shut the door behind him, 
Gen
19:7  and said, “Please, my brothers, do
not do evil! 
Gen
19:8  “Look, please, I have two daughters
who have not known a man. Please, let me bring them out to you, and do to them
as you wish, only do no deed to these men, because they have come under the
shadow of my roof.” 
Gen
19:9  But they said, “Stand back!” And
they said, “This one came in to sojourn, and should he always judge? Now we are
going to treat you worse than them.” So they pressed hard against the man Lot,
and came near to break down the door. 
Gen
19:10  But the men reached out their
hands and pulled Lot into the house with them, and shut the door. 
Gen
19:11  Then they struck the men who were
at the doorway of the house with blindness, both small and great, and they
wearied themselves to find the door. 
Gen
19:12  And the men said to Lot, “Have you
anyone else here? A son-in-law, and your sons, and your daughters, and whomever
you have in the city – bring them out of this place! 
Gen
19:13  “For we are going to destroy this
place, because the cry against them has grown great before the face of יהוה,
and יהוה has sent us to destroy it.” 
Gen
19:14  And Lot went out and spoke to his
sons-in-law, who had married his daughters, and said, “Get up, get out of this
place, for יהוה is going to destroy this city!” But to
his sons-in-law he seemed to be as one joking. 
Gen
19:15  And when morning dawned, the
messengers urged Lot to hurry, saying, “Get up, take your wife and your two
daughters who are here, lest you be consumed in the punishment of the city.” 
Gen
19:16  And while he loitered, the men
took hold of his hand, and his wife’s hand, and the hands of his two daughters,
יהוה having compassion on him, and they brought him out
and set him outside the city. 
Gen
19:17  And it came to be, when they had
brought them outside, that he said, “Escape for your life! Do not look behind
you nor stay anywhere in the plain. Escape to the mountains, lest you be
consumed.” 
Gen
19:18  And Lot said to them, “Oh no, יהוה
! 
Gen
19:19  “Look, please, your servant has
found favour in your eyes, and you have increased your kindness which you have
shown me by saving my life, but I am unable to escape to the mountains, lest
calamity overtake me and I die. 
Gen
19:20  “Look, please, this city is near
enough to flee to, and it is small. Please let me escape there – is it not a
small matter – and let my life be saved?” 
Gen
19:21  And He said to him, “Look, I have
favoured you concerning this matter also, without overthrowing this city for
which you have spoken. 
Gen
19:22  “Hurry, escape there. For I am not
able to do any deed until you arrive there.” So the name of the city was called
Tso‛ar. 
Gen
19:23  The sun had risen upon the earth
when Lot entered Tso‛ar. 
Gen
19:24  And יהוה
rained sulphur and fire on Seḏom and Amorah, from יהוה
out of the heavens. 
Gen
19:25  So He overthrew those cities, and
all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and what grew on the
ground. 
Gen
19:26  But his wife looked back from
behind him, and she became a post of salt. 
Gen
19:27  And Aḇraham arose early in
the morning and went to the place
where he had stood before יהוה, 
Gen
19:28  and he looked toward Seḏom
and Amorah, and toward all the land of the plain. And he looked and saw the
smoke of the land which went up like the smoke of a furnace. 
Gen
19:29  Thus it came to be, when Elohim
destroyed the cities of the plain, that Elohim remembered Aḇraham, and
sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when He overthrew the cities in
which Lot had dwelt. 
Gen
19:30  And Lot went up out of Tso‛ar
and dwelt in the mountains, and his two daughters were with him, for he was
afraid to dwell in Tso‛ar. And he and his two daughters dwelt in a cave. 
Gen
19:31  And the first-born said to the
younger, “Our father is old, and there is no man on the earth to come in to us,
as is the way of all the earth. 
Gen
19:32  “Come, let us make our father
drink wine and lie with him, so that we preserve the seed of our father.” 
Gen
19:33  So they made their father drink
wine that night. And the first-born went in and lay with her father, and he was
not aware of it when she lay down or when she arose. 
Gen
19:34  And it came to be on the next day
that the first-born said to the younger, “See, I lay with my father last night.
Let us make him drink wine tonight as well, and you go in and lie with him, so
that we keep the seed of our father.” 
Gen
19:35  So they made their father drink
wine that night as well. And the younger arose and lay with him, and he was not
aware of it when she lay down or when she arose. 
Gen
19:36  Thus both the daughters of Lot
became pregnant by their father. 
Gen
19:37  And the first-born bore a son and
called his name Mo’aḇ, he is the father of the Mo’aḇites to this
day. 
Gen
19:38  And the younger, she also bore a
son and called his name Ben-Ammi, he is the father of the children of Ammon to
this day. 
Gen
20:1  And Aḇraham set out from
there to the land of the South, and dwelt between Qaḏĕsh and Shur,
and stayed in Gerar. 
Gen
20:2  And Aḇraham said concerning
Sarah his wife, “She is my sister.” And Aḇimeleḵ sovereign of Gerar
sent and took Sarah. 
Gen
20:3  But Elohim came to Aḇimeleḵ
in a dream by night, and said to him, “See, you are a dead man because of the
woman whom you have taken, for she is a man’s wife.” 
Gen
20:4  However, Aḇimeleḵ had
not come near her, and he said, “ יהוה, would You slay
a righteous nation also? 
Gen
20:5  “Did he not say to me, ‘She is my
sister’? And she, even she herself said, ‘He is my brother.’ In the integrity
of my heart and in the innocence of my hands I have done this.” 
Gen
20:6  And Elohim said to him in a dream, “Yea,
I know that you did this in the integrity of your heart, and so I kept you from
sinning against Me. For this reason I did not let you touch her. 
Gen
20:7  “And now, return the man’s wife,
for he is a prophet, and let him pray for you and you live. But if you do not
return her, know that you shall certainly die, you and all that are yours.” 
Gen
20:8  So Aḇimeleḵ rose early
in the morning, and called all his servants, and spoke all these words in their
hearing. And the men were greatly frightened. 
Gen
20:9  And Aḇimeleḵ called Aḇraham
and said to him, “What have you done to us? In what have I sinned against you,
that you have brought on me and on my reign a great sin? You have done matters
to me that should not be done.” 
Gen
20:10  And Aḇimeleḵ said to Aḇraham,
“What did you have in view, that you have done this matter?” 
Gen
20:11  And Aḇraham said, “Only
because I said to myself, the fear of
Elohim is not in this place, and they shall kill me for the sake of my wife. 
Gen
20:12  “And yet, she is truly my sister.
She is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother, and she
became my wife. 
Gen
20:13  “And it came to be, when Elohim
caused me to wander from my father’s house, that I said to her, ‘This is your
kindness that you should do for me: in every place, wherever we go, say of me, “He
is my brother.” ’ ” 
Gen
20:14  Then Aḇimeleḵ took
sheep, and cattle, and male and female servants, and gave them to Aḇraham.
And he returned Sarah his wife to him. 
Gen
20:15  And Aḇimeleḵ said, “See,
my land is before you, dwell wherever it is good in your eyes.” 
Gen
20:16  And to Sarah he said, “See, I have
given your brother a thousand pieces of silver. See, it is to you a covering of
eyes before all who are with you and before all others, and you are cleared
before everyone.” 
Gen
20:17  And Aḇraham prayed to
Elohim, and Elohim healed Aḇimeleḵ, and his wife, and his female
servants, so they bore children, 
Gen
20:18  for יהוה
had closed up all the wombs of the house of Aḇimeleḵ because of
Sarah, Aḇraham’s wife. 
Gen
21:1  And יהוה
visited Sarah as He had said, and יהוה did for Sarah as
He had spoken. 
Gen
21:2  So Sarah conceived and bore Aḇraham
a son in his old age, at the appointed time of which Elohim had spoken to him. 
Gen
21:3  And Aḇraham called the name
of his son who was born to him, whom Sarah bore to him, Yitsḥaq. 
Gen
21:4  And Aḇraham circumcised his
son Yitsḥaq when he was eight days old, as Elohim had commanded him. 
Gen
21:5  And Aḇraham was one hundred
years old when his son Yitsḥaq was born to him. 
Gen
21:6  And Sarah said, “Elohim has made me
laugh, and everyone who hears of it laughs with me.” 
Gen
21:7  And she said, “Who would have said
to Aḇraham that Sarah would nurse children? For I have borne him a son in
his old age.” 
Gen
21:8  And the child grew and was weaned,
and Aḇraham made a great feast on the day that Yitsḥaq was weaned. 
Gen
21:9  And Sarah saw the son of Haḡar
the Mitsrite, whom she had borne to Aḇraham, mocking. 
Gen
21:10  So she said to Aḇraham, “Drive
out this female servant and her son, for the son of this female servant shall
not inherit with my son, with Yitsḥaq.” 
Gen
21:11  And the matter was very evil in the
eyes of Aḇraham because of his son. 
Gen
21:12  But Elohim said to Aḇraham, “Let
it not be evil in your eyes because of the boy and because of your female
servant. Whatever Sarah has said to you, listen to her voice, for in
Yitsḥaq your seed is called. 
Gen
21:13  “And of the son of the female
servant I also make a nation, because he is your seed.” 
Gen
21:14  And Aḇraham rose early in
the morning, and took bread and a skin of water, which he gave to Haḡar,
putting it on her shoulder, also the boy, and sent her away. And she left and
wandered in the Wilderness of Be’ĕrsheḇa. 
Gen
21:15  And the water in the skin was used
up, and she placed the boy under one of the shrubs. 
Gen
21:16  And she went and sat down about a
bowshot away, for she said, “Let me not see the death of the boy.” And she sat
opposite him, and lifted her voice and wept. 
Gen
21:17  And Elohim heard the voice of the
boy, and the messenger of Elohim called to Haḡar from the heavens, and
said to her, “What is the matter with you, Haḡar? Do not fear, for Elohim
has heard the voice of the boy where he is. 
Gen
21:18  “Arise, lift up the boy and hold
him with your hand, for I make a great nation of him.” 
Gen
21:19  And Elohim opened her eyes, and
she saw a well of water. And she went and filled the skin with water, and gave
the boy a drink. 
Gen
21:20  And Elohim was with the boy, and
he grew and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer. 
Gen
21:21  And he dwelt in the Wilderness of
Paran, and his mother took a wife for him from the land of Mitsrayim. 
Gen
21:22  And it came to be at that time
that Aḇimeleḵ and Piḵol, the commander of his army, spoke to
Aḇraham, saying, “Elohim is with you in all that you do. 
Gen
21:23  “And now, swear to me by Elohim,
not to be untrue to me, to my offspring, or to my descendants. Do to me
according to the kindness that I have done to you and to the land in which you
have dwelt.” 
Gen
21:24  And Aḇraham said, “I swear.”

Gen
21:25  And Aḇraham reproved Aḇimeleḵ
because of a well of water which Aḇimeleḵ’s servants had seized. 
Gen
21:26  And Aḇimeleḵ said, “I
do not know who has done this deed. Neither did you inform me, nor did I hear
until today.” 
Gen
21:27  So Aḇraham took sheep and
cattle and gave them to Aḇimeleḵ, and the two of them made a
covenant. 
Gen
21:28  And Aḇraham set seven ewe
lambs of the flock by themselves. 
Gen
21:29  And Aḇimeleḵ asked Aḇraham,
“What are these seven ewe lambs which you have set by themselves?” 
Gen
21:30  And he said, “Take these seven ewe
lambs from my hand, to be my witness that I have dug this well.” 
Gen
21:31  So he called that place Be’ĕrsheḇa,
because the two of them swore an oath there. 
Gen
21:32  Thus they made a covenant at Be’ĕrsheḇa.
And Aḇimeleḵ rose with Piḵol, the commander of his army, and
they returned to the land of the Philistines. 
Gen
21:33  And he planted a tamarisk tree in
Be’ĕrsheḇa, and there called on the Name of יהוה,
the Everlasting Ĕl. 
Gen
21:34  And Aḇraham sojourned in the
land of the Philistines many days. 
Gen
22:1  And it came to be after these
events that Elohim tried Aḇraham, and said to him, “Aḇraham!” And
he said, “Here I am.” 
Gen
22:2  And He said, “Take your son, now,
your only son Yitsḥaq, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriyah, and
offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains which I command
you.” 
Gen
22:3  And Aḇraham rose early in the
morning and saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and
Yitsḥaq his son. And he split the wood for the burnt offering, and arose
and went to the place which Elohim had commanded him. 
Gen
22:4  And on the third day Aḇraham
lifted his eyes and saw the place from a distance. 
Gen
22:5  So Aḇraham said to his young
men, “Stay here with the donkey while the boy and I go over there and worship,
and come back to you.” 
Gen
22:6  And Aḇraham took the wood of
the burnt offering and laid it on Yitsḥaq his son. And he took the fire
in his hand, and a knife, and the two of them went together. 
Gen
22:7  And Yitsḥaq spoke to Aḇraham
his father and said, “My father!” And he said, “Here I am, my son.” And he
said, “See, the fire and the wood! But where is the lamb for a burnt offering?”

Gen
22:8  And Aḇraham said, “My son,
Elohim does provide for Himself the lamb for a burnt offering.” And the two of
them went together. 
Gen
22:9  And they came to the place which
Elohim had commanded him, and Aḇraham built an altar there and placed the
wood in order. And he bound Yitsḥaq his son and laid him on the altar,
upon the wood. 
Gen
22:10  And Aḇraham stretched out
his hand and took the knife to slay his son, 
Gen
22:11  but the Messenger of יהוה
called to him from the heavens and said, “Aḇraham, Aḇraham!” And he
said, “Here I am.” 
Gen
22:12  And He said, “Do not lay your hand
on the boy, nor touch him. For now I know that you fear Elohim, seeing you have
not withheld your son, your only son, from Me.” 
Gen
22:13  And Aḇraham lifted his eyes
and looked and saw behind him a ram caught in a bush by its horns, and Aḇraham
went and took the ram and offered it up for a burnt offering instead of his
son. 
Gen
22:14  And Aḇraham called the name
of the place, ‘ יהוה Yireh,’ as it is said to this day,
“On the mountain יהוה provides.” 
Gen
22:15  And the Messenger of יהוה
called to Aḇraham a second time from the heavens, 
Gen
22:16  and said, “By Myself I have sworn,
declares יהוה, because you have done this, and have not
withheld your son, your only son, 
Gen
22:17  that I shall certainly bless you,
and I shall certainly increase your seed as the stars of the heavens and as the
sand which is on the seashore, and let your seed possess the gate of their
enemies. 
Gen
22:18  “And in your seed all the nations
of the earth shall be blessed, because you have obeyed My voice.” 
Gen
22:19  Then Aḇraham returned to his
young men, and they rose up and went together to Be’ĕrsheḇa. And Aḇraham
dwelt at Be’ĕrsheḇa. 
Gen
22:20  And it came to be after these
events that it was reported to Aḇraham, saying, “See, Milkah too has
borne children to your brother Naḥor: 
Gen
22:21  “Uts his first-born, and Buz his
brother, and Qemu’ĕl the father of Aram, 
Gen
22:22  and Keseḏ, and Ḥazo,
and Pildash, and Yiḏlaph, and Bethu’ĕl.” 
Gen
22:23  And Bethu’ĕl brought forth Riḇqah.
These eight Milkah bore to Naḥor, Aḇraham’s brother. 
Gen
22:24  And his concubine, whose name was
Re’uwmah, also bore Teḇaḥ, and Gaḥam, and Taḥash, and
Ma‛aḵah. 
Gen
23:1  And Sarah lived one hundred and
twenty-seven years, the years of the life of Sarah. 
Gen
23:2  And Sarah died in Qiryath Arba,
that is Ḥeḇron, in the land of Kena‛an, and Aḇraham
came to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her. 
Gen
23:3  Then Aḇraham rose up from
beside his dead, and spoke to the sons of Ḥĕth, saying, 
Gen
23:4  “I am a foreigner and a sojourner
among you. Give me property for a burial site among you, so that I bury my dead
from my presence.” 
Gen
23:5  And the sons of Ḥĕth
answered Aḇraham, saying to him, 
Gen
23:6  “Hear us, my master: You are a
prince of Elohim among us. Bury your dead in the choicest of our burial places.
None of us withholds from you his burial site, from burying your dead.” 
Gen
23:7  So Aḇraham rose and bowed
himself to the people of the land, the sons of Ḥĕth. 
Gen
23:8  And he spoke with them, saying, “If
it is your desire that I bury my dead from my presence, hear me, and approach
Ephron son of Tsoḥar for me, 
Gen
23:9  and let me have the cave of Maḵpĕlah
which he has, which is at the end of his field. Let him give it to me for the
complete amount of silver, as property for a burial site among you.” 
Gen
23:10  And Ephron dwelt among the sons of
Ḥĕth. And Ephron the Ḥittite answered Aḇraham in the
hearing of the sons of Ḥĕth, all who entered at the gate of his
city, saying, 
Gen
23:11  “No, my master, listen to me! I
shall give you the field and the cave that is in it. I shall give it to you in
the presence of the sons of my people. I shall give it to you. Bury your dead!”

Gen
23:12  And Aḇraham bowed himself
down before the people of the land, 
Gen
23:13  and he spoke to Ephron in the
hearing of the people of the land, saying, “If only you would hear me. I shall
give the amount of silver for the field, take it from me, and let me bury my
dead there.” 
Gen
23:14  And Ephron answered Aḇraham,
saying to him, 
Gen
23:15  “My master, listen to me! The land
is worth four hundred sheqels of silver. What is that between you and me? So
bury your dead.” 
Gen
23:16  And Aḇraham listened to
Ephron, and Aḇraham weighed out the silver for Ephron which he had named
in the hearing of the sons of Ḥĕth, four hundred sheqels of silver,
currency of the merchants. 
Gen
23:17  Thus the field of Ephron which was
in Maḵpĕlah, which was before Mamrĕ, the field and the cave
which was in it, and all the trees that were in the field, which were within
all the surrounding borders, were deeded 
Gen
23:18  to Aḇraham as a possession
in the presence of the sons of Ḥĕth, before all who went in at the
gate of his city. 
Gen
23:19  And after this Aḇraham
buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Maḵpĕlah, before
Mamrĕ, that is Ḥeḇron, in the land of Kena‛an. 
Gen
23:20  Thus the field and the cave that
is in it were deeded to Aḇraham by the sons of Ḥĕth as
property for a burial site. 
Gen
24:1  And Aḇraham was old, advanced
in years. And יהוה had blessed Aḇraham in every
way. 
Gen
24:2  And Aḇraham said to the
oldest servant of his house, who ruled over all that he had, “Please, put your
hand under my thigh, 
Gen
24:3  so that I make you swear by יהוה,
the Elohim of the heavens and the Elohim of the earth, that you do not take a
wife for my son from the daughters of the Kena‛anites, among whom I
dwell, 
Gen
24:4  but to go to my land and to my
relatives, and take a wife for my son Yitsḥaq.” 
Gen
24:5  And the servant said to him, “What
if the woman refuses to follow me to this land? Do I then take your son back to
the land from which you came?” 
Gen
24:6  And Aḇraham said to him, “Beware
lest you take my son back there! 
Gen
24:7  “ יהוה,
Elohim of the heavens, who took me from my father’s house and from the land of
my relatives, and who spoke to me and swore to me, saying, ‘To your seed I give
this land,’ He sends His messenger before you, and you shall take a wife for my
son from there. 
Gen
24:8  “And if the woman refuses to follow
you, then you shall be released from this oath; only, do not take my son back
there.” 
Gen
24:9  Then the servant put his hand under
the thigh of Aḇraham his master, and swore to him concerning this matter.

Gen
24:10  And the servant took ten of his
master’s camels and left, for all his master’s good gifts were in his hand. And he arose and went to Aram Naharayim, to
the city of Naḥor. 
Gen
24:11  And he made his camels kneel down
outside the city by a fountain of water at evening time, the time when women go
out to draw water. 
Gen
24:12  And he said, “ יהוה,
Elohim of my master Aḇraham, please cause her to meet before me this day, and show kindness to my master Aḇraham.

Gen
24:13  “See, I am standing here by the fountain
of water, and the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw
water. 
Gen
24:14  “Now let it be that the young
woman to whom I say, ‘Please let down your jar to let me drink,’ and she says, ‘Drink,
and let me water your camels too,’ let her be the one whom You have appointed
for Your servant Yitsḥaq. And let me know by this that You have shown
kindness to my master.” 
Gen
24:15  And it came to be, before he had
ended speaking, that see, Riḇqah, who was born to Bethu’ĕl, son of
Milkah, the wife of Naḥor, Aḇraham’s brother, came out with her jar
on her shoulder. 
Gen
24:16  And the young woman was very
good-looking, a maiden, no man having known her. And she went down to the
fountain, filled her jar, and came up. 
Gen
24:17  And the servant ran to meet her
and said, “Please let me drink a little water from your jar.” 
Gen
24:18  And she said, “Drink, my master.”
And she hurried and let her jar down to her hand, and gave him a drink. 
Gen
24:19  And when she had finished giving
him a drink, she said, “Let me draw water for your camels too, until they have
finished drinking.” 
Gen
24:20  And she hurried and emptied her
jar into the trough, ran back to the fountain to draw water, and drew for all
his camels. 
Gen
24:21  And watching her, the man remained
silent in order to know whether יהוה had prospered his
way or not. 
Gen
24:22  And it came to be, when the camels
had finished drinking, that the man took a golden nose ring weighing half a
sheqel, and two bracelets for her wrists weighing ten sheqels of gold, 
Gen
24:23  and said, “Whose daughter are you?
Please inform me, is there room in your father’s house for us to spend the
night?” 
Gen
24:24  And she said to him, “I am the
daughter of Bethu’ĕl, Milkah’s son, whom she bore to Naḥor.” 
Gen
24:25  And she said to him, “We have both
straw and fodder enough, and room to spend the night.” 
Gen
24:26  And the man bowed down his head
and worshipped יהוה. 
Gen
24:27  And he said, “Blessed be יהוה
Elohim of my master Aḇraham, who has not forsaken His kindness and His
truth toward my master. As for me, being on the way, יהוה
led me to the house of my master’s brothers.” 
Gen
24:28  Then the young woman ran and
informed those of her mother’s house these matters. 
Gen
24:29  And Riḇqah had a brother
whose name was Laḇan, and Laḇan ran out to the man, to the
fountain. 
Gen
24:30  And it came to be, when he saw the
nose ring, and the bracelets on his sister’s wrists, and when he heard the
words of his sister Riḇqah, saying, “Thus the man spoke to me,” that he
went to the man and saw him standing by the camels at the fountain. 
Gen
24:31  And he said, “Come in, O blessed
of יהוה ! Why do you stand outside? I myself have
prepared the house, and a place for the camels.” 
Gen
24:32  So the man came into the house,
while he unloaded the camels and provided straw and fodder for the camels and
water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him, 
Gen
24:33  and set food before him to eat.
But he said, “Let me not eat until I have spoken my word.” And he said, “Speak
on.” 
Gen
24:34  And he said, “I am Aḇraham’s
servant. 
Gen
24:35  “And יהוה
has blessed my master exceedingly, and he has become great. And He has given
him flocks and herds, and silver and gold, and male and female servants, and
camels and donkeys. 
Gen
24:36  “And Sarah my master’s wife bore a
son to my master when she was old. And he has given to him all that he has. 
Gen
24:37  “And my master made me swear,
saying, ‘Do not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Kena‛anites,
in whose land I dwell, 
Gen
24:38  but go to my father’s house and to
my relatives, and take a wife for my son.’ 
Gen
24:39  “And I said to my master, ‘What if
the woman does not follow me?’ 
Gen
24:40  “But he said to me, ‘ יהוה,
before whom I walk, sends His messenger with you and shall prosper your way.
And you shall take a wife for my son from my relatives and from my father’s
house. 
Gen
24:41  ‘Then, when you go to my
relatives, you are to be released from this oath. And if they do not give her
to you, then you are released from my oath.’ 
Gen
24:42  “And this day I came to the
fountain and said, ‘ יהוה, Elohim of my master Aḇraham,
please, if You are prospering the way in which I am going, 
Gen
24:43  see, I am standing by the fountain
of water, and when the maiden comes out to draw water, and I say to her, “Please
give me a little water from your jar to drink,” 
Gen
24:44  and she says to me, “Drink, and
let me draw for your camels too,” let her be the woman whom יהוה
has appointed for my master’s son.’ 
Gen
24:45  “I had not yet ended speaking in
my heart, then see, Riḇqah was coming out with her jar on her shoulder.
And she went down to the fountain and drew water. And I said to her, ‘Please
let me drink.’ 
Gen
24:46  “And she hurried and let her jar
down from her shoulder, and said, ‘Drink, and let me water your camels too.’ So
I drank, and she watered the camels too. 
Gen
24:47  “And I asked her, and said, ‘Whose
daughter are you?’ And she said, ‘The daughter of Bethu’ĕl, Naḥor’s
son, whom Milkah bore to him.’ Then I put the nose ring on her nose and the
bracelets on her wrists. 
Gen
24:48  “And I bowed my head and
worshipped יהוה, and blessed יהוה,
Elohim of my master Aḇraham, who had led me in the true way to take the
daughter of my master’s brother for his son. 
Gen
24:49  “And now, if you are going to show
kindness and truth to my master, let me know, and if not, let me know, so that
I turn to the right or to the left.” 
Gen
24:50  And Laḇan answered – Bethu’ĕl
too – and said, “The matter comes from יהוה, we are not
able to speak to you either evil or good. 
Gen
24:51  “See, Riḇqah is before you.
Take her and go, and let her be your master’s son’s wife, as יהוה
has spoken.” 
Gen
24:52  And it came to be, when Aḇraham’s
servant heard their words, that he bowed himself towards the earth before יהוה.

Gen
24:53  And the servant brought out
ornaments of silver, and ornaments of gold, and garments, and gave them to Riḇqah.
He also gave costly gifts to her brother and to her mother. 
Gen
24:54  And he and the men who were with
him ate and drank and spent the night. When they arose in the morning he said, “Let
me go to my master.” 
Gen
24:55  But her brother and her mother
said, “Let the young woman stay with us a few days, at least ten, then you go.”

Gen
24:56  And he said to them, “Do not delay
me, since יהוה has prospered my way. Let me go so that
I go to my master.” 
Gen
24:57  And they said, “Let us call the
young woman and ask her.” 
Gen
24:58  So they called Riḇqah and
said to her, “Are you going with this man?” And she said, “I shall go.” 
Gen
24:59  So they let go Riḇqah their
sister and her nurse, and Aḇraham’s servant and his men. 
Gen
24:60  And they blessed Riḇqah and
said to her, “Let our sister become the mother of thousands of ten thousands,
and let your seed possess the gates of those who hate them.” 
Gen
24:61  And Riḇqah and her young
women arose, and they rode on the camels and followed the man. So the servant
took Riḇqah and left. 
Gen
24:62  And Yitsḥaq came from the
way of Be’ĕr Laḥai Ro’i, for he dwelt in the South. 
Gen
24:63  And Yitsḥaq went out to
meditate in the field in the evening. And he lifted his eyes and looked and saw
the camels coming. 
Gen
24:64  And Riḇqah lifted her eyes,
and when she saw Yitsḥaq she dismounted from her camel, 
Gen
24:65  and she had said to the servant, “Who
is this man walking in the field to meet us?” And the servant said, “It is my
master.” So she took a veil and covered herself. 
Gen
24:66  And the servant told Yitsḥaq
all the matters he had done. 
Gen
24:67  And Yitsḥaq brought her into
his mother Sarah’s tent. And he took Riḇqah and she became his wife, and
he loved her. Thus Yitsḥaq was comforted after his mother’s death. 
Gen
25:1  And Aḇraham took another
wife, whose name was Qeturah. 
Gen
25:2  And she bore him Zimran, and
Yoqshan, and Meḏan, and Miḏyan, and Yishbaq, and Shuwaḥ. 
Gen
25:3  And Yoqshan brought forth Sheḇa
and Deḏan. And the sons of Deḏan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and
Le’ummim. 
Gen
25:4  And the sons of Miḏyan were Ĕphah,
and Ĕpher, and Ḥanoḵ, and Aḇiḏa, and Elda‛ah.
All these were the children of Qeturah. 
Gen
25:5  Now Aḇraham gave all that he
had to Yitsḥaq, 
Gen
25:6  but to the sons of the concubines
whom Aḇraham had, Aḇraham gave gifts while he was still living, and
sent them away from his son Yitsḥaq, eastward, to the land of the east. 
Gen
25:7  And these are all the years of Aḇraham’s
life which he lived: one hundred and seventy-five years. 
Gen
25:8  And Aḇraham breathed his last
and died in a good old age, aged and satisfied, and was gathered to his people.

Gen
25:9  And his sons Yitsḥaq and
Yishma‛ĕl buried him in the cave of Maḵpĕlah, which is
before Mamrĕ, in the field of Ephron son of Tsoḥar the Ḥittite,

Gen
25:10  the field which Aḇraham
purchased from the sons of Ḥĕth. There Aḇraham was buried with
Sarah his wife. 
Gen
25:11  And it came to be, after the death
of Aḇraham, that Elohim blessed his son Yitsḥaq. And Yitsḥaq
dwelt at Be’ĕr Laḥai Ro’i. 
Gen
25:12  And this is the genealogy of
Yishma‛ĕl, Aḇraham’s son, whom Haḡar the Mitsrite, Sarah’s
female servant, bore to Aḇraham. 
Gen
25:13  And these were the names of the
sons of Yishma‛ĕl, by their names, according to their generations:
The first-born of Yishma‛ĕl, Neḇayoth; then Qĕḏar,
and Aḏbe’ĕl, and Miḇsam, 
Gen
25:14  and Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa, 
Gen
25:15  Haḏar, and Tĕma, Yetur,
Naphish, and Qĕḏemah. 
Gen
25:16  These were the sons of Yishma‛ĕl
and these were their names, by their towns and their settlements, twelve chiefs
according to their tribes. 
Gen
25:17  And these were the years of the
life of Yishma‛ĕl: one hundred and thirty-seven years. And he
breathed his last and died, and was gathered to his people. 
Gen
25:18  And they dwelt from Ḥawilah
as far as Shur, which is east of Mitsrayim as you go toward Ashshur. He settled
before all his brothers. 
Gen
25:19  And this is the genealogy of
Yitsḥaq, Aḇraham’s son. Aḇraham brought forth Yitsḥaq. 
Gen
25:20  And Yitsḥaq was forty years
old when he took Riḇqah as wife, the daughter of Bethu’ĕl the
Aramean of Paddan Aram, the sister of Laḇan the Aramean. 
Gen
25:21  And Yitsḥaq prayed to יהוה
for his wife, because she was barren. And יהוה answered
his prayer, and Riḇqah his wife conceived. 
Gen
25:22  And within her the children
struggled together, and she said, “If all is right, why am I this way?” So she
went to ask יהוה. 
Gen
25:23  And יהוה
said to her, “Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples shall be separated
from your body. And one people shall be stronger than the other, and the older
serve the younger.” 
Gen
25:24  And when the days were filled for
her to give birth, and see, twins were in her womb! 
Gen
25:25  And the first came out red all
over, like a hairy garment, so they called his name Ĕsaw. 
Gen
25:26  And afterward his brother came
out, with his hand holding on to Ĕsaw’s heel, so his name was called Ya‛aqoḇ.
And Yitsḥaq was sixty years old when she bore them. 
Gen
25:27  And the boys grew up. And Ĕsaw
became a man knowing how to hunt, a man of the field, while Ya‛aqoḇ
was a complete man, dwelling in tents. 
Gen
25:28  And Yitsḥaq loved Ĕsaw
because he ate of his wild game, but Riḇqah loved Ya‛aqoḇ. 
Gen
25:29  And Ya‛aqoḇ cooked a
stew, and Ĕsaw came in from the field, and he was weary. 
Gen
25:30  And Ĕsaw said to Ya‛aqoḇ,
“Please feed me with that same red stew, for I am weary.” That is why his name
was called Eḏom. 
Gen
25:31  But Ya‛aqoḇ said, “Sell
me your birthright today.” 
Gen
25:32  And Ĕsaw said, “Look, I am
going to die, so why should I have birthright?” 
Gen
25:33  Then Ya‛aqoḇ said, “Swear
to me today.” And he swore to him, and sold his birthright to Ya‛aqoḇ.

Gen
25:34  Ya‛aqoḇ then gave Ĕsaw
bread and stew of lentils. And he ate and drank, and rose up and left. Thus Ĕsaw
despised his birthright. 
Gen
26:1  And there was a scarcity of food in
the land, besides the first scarcity of food which was in the days of Aḇraham.
And Yitsḥaq went to Aḇimeleḵ, sovereign of the Philistines,
in Gerar. 
Gen
26:2  And יהוה appeared
to him and said, “Do not go down to Mitsrayim, live in the land which I command
you. 
Gen
26:3  “Sojourn in this land. And I shall
be with you and bless you, for I give all these lands to you and your seed. And
I shall establish the oath which I swore to Aḇraham your father. 
Gen
26:4  “And I shall increase your seed
like the stars of the heavens, and I shall give all these lands to your seed.
And in your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed, 
Gen
26:5  because Aḇraham obeyed My
voice and guarded My Charge: My commands, My laws, and My Torot.”
Gen
26:6  And Yitsḥaq dwelt in Gerar. 
Gen
26:7  And when the men of the place asked
about his wife, he said, “She is my sister.” For he was afraid to say, “She is
my wife,” thinking, “lest the men of
the place should kill me for Riḇqah, because she is good-looking.” 
Gen
26:8  And it came to be, when he had been
there a long time, that Aḇimeleḵ sovereign of the Philistines
looked through a window, and he watched and saw Yitsḥaq playing with Riḇqah
his wife. 
Gen
26:9  So Aḇimeleḵ called
Yitsḥaq and said, “See, truly she is your wife! So how could you say, ‘She
is my sister’?” And Yitsḥaq said to him, “Because I said, ‘Lest I die on
account of her.’ ” 
Gen
26:10  And Aḇimeleḵ said, “What
is this you have done to us? One of the people had almost lain with your wife,
and you would have brought guilt on us.” 
Gen
26:11  And Aḇimeleḵ commanded
all his people, saying, “He who touches this man or his wife shall certainly be
put to death.” 
Gen
26:12  And Yitsḥaq sowed in that
land, and reaped in the same year a hundredfold, and יהוה
blessed him. 
Gen
26:13  And the man grew great and went
forward until he became very great. 
Gen
26:14  And he came to have possessions of
flocks and possessions of herds and a great body of servants, and the
Philistines envied him. 
Gen
26:15  And the Philistines had stopped up
all the wells which his father’s servants had dug in the days of Aḇraham
his father, and filled them with dirt. 
Gen
26:16  And Aḇimeleḵ said to
Yitsḥaq, “Go away from us, for you are much mightier than we.” 
Gen
26:17  So Yitsḥaq went from there
and pitched his tent in the wadi Gerar, and dwelt there. 
Gen
26:18  And Yitsḥaq dug again the
wells of water which they had dug in the days of Aḇraham his father, for
the Philistines had stopped them up after the death of Aḇraham. And he
called them by the names which his father had called them. 
Gen
26:19  But when Yitsḥaq’s servants
dug in the wadi and found a well of running water there, 
Gen
26:20  the herdsmen of Gerar strove with
Yitsḥaq’s herdsmen, saying, “The water is ours.” And he called the name
of the well Ĕseq, because they strove with him. 
Gen
26:21  And they dug another well, and
they strove over that one too, and he called its name Sitnah. 
Gen
26:22  And he moved from there and dug
another well, and they did not strive over it. And he called its name
Reḥoḇoth, and said, “For now יהוה has made
room for us, and we shall bear fruit in the land.” 
Gen
26:23  And from there he went up to Be’ĕrsheḇa.

Gen
26:24  And יהוה
appeared to him the same night and said, “I am the Elohim of your father Aḇraham.
Do not fear, for I am with you, and shall bless you and increase your seed for
My servant Aḇraham’s sake.” 
Gen
26:25  And he built an altar there, and
called on the Name of יהוה, and he pitched his tent
there, and the servants of Yitsḥaq dug a well there. 
Gen
26:26  And Aḇimeleḵ came to
him from Gerar, with Aḥuzzath, one of his friends, and Piḵol the
commander of his army. 
Gen
26:27  And Yitsḥaq said to them, “Why
have you come to me, seeing you have hated me and have sent me away from you?” 
Gen
26:28  But they said, “We have clearly
seen that יהוה is with you. And we said, ‘Please, let
there be an oath between us, between you and us. And let us make a covenant
with you, 
Gen
26:29  that you do no evil to us, as we
have not touched you, and as we have done only good toward you, and have sent
you away in peace. You are now blessed by יהוה.’ ” 
Gen
26:30  And he made them a feast, and they
ate and drank. 
Gen
26:31  And they rose early in the morning
and swore an oath with one another. And Yitsḥaq let them go, and they
departed from him in peace. 
Gen
26:32  And on the same day it came to be
that the servants of Yitsḥaq came and informed him about the well which
they had dug, and said to him, “We have found water.” 
Gen
26:33  So he called it Shiḇah.
Therefore the name of the city is Be’ĕrsheḇa to this day. 
Gen
26:34  And when Ĕsaw was forty years
old, he took as wives Yehuḏith the daughter of Be’ĕri the Ḥittite,
and Basemath the daughter of Ĕlon the Ḥittite. 
Gen
26:35  And they were a bitterness of
spirit to Yitsḥaq and Riḇqah. 
Gen
27:1  And it came to be, when
Yitsḥaq was old and his eyes were too dim to see, that he called Ĕsaw
his elder son and said to him, “My son.” And he answered him, “Here I am.” 
Gen
27:2  And he said, “See now, I am old, I
do not know the day of my death. 
Gen
27:3  “Now then, please take your
weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field and hunt wild game
for me. 
Gen
27:4  “And make me a tasty dish, such as
I love, and bring it to me to eat, in order that my being does bless you before
I die.” 
Gen
27:5  And Riḇqah heard when
Yitsḥaq spoke to Ĕsaw his son. And Ĕsaw went to the field to
hunt wild game and to bring it. 
Gen
27:6  And Riḇqah spoke to Ya‛aqoḇ
her son, saying, “See, I heard your father speak to Ĕsaw your brother,
saying, 
Gen
27:7  ‘Bring me wild game and make me a
tasty dish to eat, and bless you in the presence of יהוה
before my death.’ 
Gen
27:8  “And now my son, listen to my voice
according to what I command you. 
Gen
27:9  “Please go to the flock and bring
me two choice young goats, and I make a tasty dish from them for your father,
such as he loves. 
Gen
27:10  “And you shall take it to your
father, and he shall eat it, so that he might bless you before his death.” 
Gen
27:11  And Ya‛aqoḇ said to Riḇqah
his mother, “See, Ĕsaw my brother is a hairy man, and I am a
smooth-skinned man. 
Gen
27:12  “What if my father touches me?
Then I shall be like a deceiver in his eyes, and shall bring a curse on myself
and not a blessing.” 
Gen
27:13  But his mother said to him, “Let
your curse be on me, my son. Only obey my voice, and go, get them for me.” 
Gen
27:14  And he went and fetched them and
brought them to his mother, and his mother made a tasty dish, such as his
father loved. 
Gen
27:15  And Riḇqah took the best
garments of her elder son Ĕsaw, which were with her in the house, and put
them on Ya‛aqoḇ her younger son. 
Gen
27:16  And she put the skins of the young
goats on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck. 
Gen
27:17  Then she gave the tasty dish and
the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Ya‛aqoḇ.

Gen
27:18  And he went to his father and
said, “My father.” And he said, “Here I am. Who are you, my son?” 
Gen
27:19  And Ya‛aqoḇ said to
his father, “I am Ĕsaw your first-born, I have done as you said to me. Please
rise, sit and eat of my wild game, so that your being might bless me.” 
Gen
27:20  But Yitsḥaq said to his son,
“How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son?” And he said, “Because יהוה
your Elohim brought it to me.” 
Gen
27:21  Then Yitsḥaq said to Ya‛aqoḇ,
“Please come near, so that I feel you, my son, whether you truly are my son Ĕsaw
or not.” 
Gen
27:22  And Ya‛aqoḇ went near
to Yitsḥaq his father, and he felt him and said, “The voice is the voice
of Ya‛aqoḇ, but the hands are the hands of Ĕsaw.” 
Gen
27:23  And he did not recognise him, for
his hands were hairy like his brother Ĕsaw’s hands, and he blessed him. 
Gen
27:24  And he said, “Are you truly my son
Ĕsaw?” And he said, “I am.” 
Gen
27:25  And he said, “Bring it near to me,
and let me eat of my son’s wild game, so that my being might bless you.” So he
brought it near to him, and he ate. And he brought him wine, and he drank. 
Gen
27:26  And his father Yitsḥaq said
to him, “Please come near and kiss me, my son.” 
Gen
27:27  And he came near and kissed him.
And he smelled the smell of his garments, and blessed him and said, “See, the
smell of my son is like the smell of a field which יהוה
has blessed. 
Gen
27:28  And Elohim give you of the dew of
the heavens, of the fatness of the earth, and plenty of grain and wine. 
Gen
27:29  Let peoples serve you, and nations
bow down to you. Be master over your brothers, and let your mother’s sons bow
down to you. Cursed be those cursing you, and blessed be those blessing you!” 
Gen
27:30  And it came to be, as soon as
Yitsḥaq had finished blessing Ya‛aqoḇ, and Ya‛aqoḇ
had hardly left the presence of Yitsḥaq his father, that Ĕsaw his
brother came in from his hunting. 
Gen
27:31  And he too had made a tasty dish
and brought it to his father, and said to his father, “Let my father rise and
eat of his son’s wild game, so that your being might bless me.” 
Gen
27:32  And his father Yitsḥaq said
to him, “Who are you?” And he said, “I am your son, your first-born, Ĕsaw.”

Gen
27:33  Then Yitsḥaq trembled
exceedingly, and said, “Who was it then who hunted wild game and brought it to
me? And I ate all of it before you came, and I have blessed him. Yea, he is
blessed.” 
Gen
27:34  When Ĕsaw heard the words of
his father, he cried with an exceedingly great and bitter cry, and said to his
father, “Bless me, me too, O my father!” 
Gen
27:35  And he said, “Your brother came
with deceit and took your blessing.” 
Gen
27:36  And Ĕsaw said, “Was his name,
then, called Ya‛aqoḇ? For he has caught me by the heel these two
times. He took my birthright, and see, now he has taken my blessing!” And he
said, “Have you not reserved a blessing for me?” 
Gen
27:37  Then Yitsḥaq answered and
said to Ĕsaw, “See, I have made him your master, and all his brothers I
have given to him as servants. And I have sustained him with grain and wine.
And what, then, shall I do for you, my son?” 
Gen
27:38  And Ĕsaw said to his father, “Have
you only one blessing, my father? Bless me, me too, O my father!” And Ĕsaw
lifted up his voice and wept.
