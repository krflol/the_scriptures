Timotiyos Bĕt/2 Timothy
2Tim
1:1  Sha’ul, an emissary of יהושע
Messiah by the desire of Elohim, according to the promise of life which is in
Messiah יהושע, 
2Tim
1:2  to Timothy, my beloved son: Favour,
compassion, peace from Elohim the Father, and Messiah יהושע
our Master. 
2Tim
1:3  I thank Elohim, whom I serve with a
clear conscience, as my forefathers did, as I unceasingly remember you in my
prayers night and day, 
2Tim
1:4  longing to see you, as I remember
your tears, so that I might be filled with joy. 
2Tim
1:5  For I recollect the sincere belief
which is in you, which dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and your mother
Eunike, and I am persuaded is in you too. 
2Tim
1:6  For this reason I remind you to stir
up the gift of Elohim which is in you through the laying on of my hands. 
2Tim
1:7  For Elohim has not given us a spirit
of cowardice, but of power and of love and of self-control. 
2Tim
1:8  So do not be ashamed of the witness of
our Master, nor of me His prisoner, but suffer hardship with me for the Good
News according to the power of Elohim, 
2Tim
1:9  who has saved us and called us with
a set-apart calling, not according to our works, but according to His own
purpose and favour which was given to us in Messiah יהושע
before times of old, 
2Tim
1:10  but now revealed by the appearing
of our Saviour יהושע Messiah, who indeed
abolished death and brought life and incorruptibility to light through the Good
News, 
2Tim
1:11  for which I was appointed a
proclaimer, and an emissary, and a teacher of the gentiles. 
2Tim
1:12  For this reason I also suffer these
matters, but I am not ashamed, for I
know whom I have believed and am persuaded that He is able to watch over that
which I have entrusted to Him until that Day. 
2Tim
1:13  Hold the pattern of sound words
which you have heard from me, in belief and love which are in Messiah יהושע.

2Tim
1:14  Watch over the good deposit that
was entrusted to you, by the Set-apart Spirit dwelling in us. 
2Tim
1:15  You know this, that all those in
Asia have turned away from me, among whom are Phugellos and Hermogenes. 
2Tim
1:16  The Master grant compassion unto
the household of Onesiphoros, for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of
my chain, 
2Tim
1:17  but when he was in Rome, he eagerly
searched for me and found me. 
2Tim
1:18  The Master grant to him to find
compassion from the Master in that Day. And you know very well how many ways he
attended to me at Ephesos. 
2Tim
2:1  You then, my son, be strong in the
favour that is in Messiah יהושע. 
2Tim
2:2  And what you have heard from me
among many witnesses, entrust these to trustworthy men who shall be competent
to teach others as well. 
2Tim
2:3  Suffer hardship with us as a good soldier of יהושע
Messiah. 
2Tim
2:4  No one serving as a soldier gets
involved in the affairs of this life, in order to please only him who enlisted him as a soldier. 
2Tim
2:5  And if anyone competes in a game, he
is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules. 
2Tim
2:6  The hard-working farmer ought to be
first to receive his share of the crops. 
2Tim
2:7  Think over what I say, for the
Master shall give you understanding into all this. 
2Tim
2:8  Remember that יהושע
Messiah, of the seed of Dawiḏ, was raised from the dead according to my
Good News, 
2Tim
2:9  for which I suffer hardship, as a
criminal, unto chains, but the Word of Elohim is not chained. 
2Tim
2:10  So I endure through it all for the
sake of the chosen, so that they too obtain deliverance which is in Messiah יהושע
with everlasting esteem. 
2Tim
2:11  Trustworthy is the word: For if we
died with Him, we shall also live with Him. 
2Tim
2:12  If we endure, we shall also reign
with Him. If we deny Him, He also
shall deny us. 
2Tim
2:13  If we are not trustworthy, He
remains trustworthy, it is impossible for Him to deny Himself. 
2Tim
2:14  Remind them of this, earnestly
witnessing before the Master, not to wage verbal battles – which is useless –
to the overthrowing of the hearers. 
2Tim
2:15  Do your utmost to present yourself
approved to Elohim, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, rightly handling
the Word of Truth. 
2Tim
2:16  But keep away from profane, empty
babblings, for they go on to more wickedness, 
2Tim
2:17  and their word shall eat its way
like gangrene. Humenaios and Philetos are of this sort, 
2Tim
2:18  who have missed the goal concerning the truth, saying
that the resurrection has already taken place, and overthrow the belief of
some. 
2Tim
2:19  However, the solid foundation of
Elohim stands firm, having this seal, “ יהוה knows
those who are His,” Bem. 16:5 and, “Let everyone who names the Name of Messiah
turn away from unrighteous-ness.” 
2Tim
2:20  But in a large house there are not
only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay, some unto value and
some unto no value. 
2Tim
2:21  If, then, anyone cleanses himself
from these matters, he shall be a
vessel unto value, having been set apart, of good use to the Master, having
been prepared for every good work. 
2Tim
2:22  And flee from the lusts of youth,
but pursue righteousness, belief, love, peace with those calling on the Master
out of a clean heart. 
2Tim
2:23  But refuse foolish and stupid
questions, knowing that they breed quarrels. 
2Tim
2:24  And a servant of the Master should
not quarrel but be gentle towards all, able to teach, patient when wronged, 
2Tim
2:25  in meekness instructing those who
are in opposition, lest somehow Elohim gives them repentance unto a thorough
knowledge of the truth, 
2Tim
2:26  and they come to their senses, out
of the snare of the devil, having been taken captive by him to do his desire. 
2Tim
3:1  But know this, that in the last days
hard times shall come. 
2Tim
3:2  For men shall be lovers of self,
lovers of money, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents,
thankless, wrong-doers, 
2Tim
3:3  unloving, unforgiving, slanderers,
without self-control, fierce, haters of good, 
2Tim
3:4  betrayers, reckless, puffed up,
lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of Elohim, 
2Tim
3:5  having a form of reverence but
denying its power. And turn away from these!
2Tim
3:6  For among them are those who creep
into households and captivate silly women loaded down with sins, led away by
various lusts, 
2Tim
3:7  always learning and never able to
come to the knowledge of the truth. 
2Tim
3:8  And as Yoḥane and Mamrĕ
opposed Mosheh, so do these also oppose the truth – men of corrupt minds, found
worthless concerning the belief; 
2Tim
3:9  but they shall not go on further,
for their folly shall be obvious to all, as also that of those men became. 
2Tim
3:10  But you did closely follow my
teaching, the way of life, the purpose, the belief, the patience, the love, the
endurance, 
2Tim
3:11  the persecutions, the sufferings,
which came to me at Antioch, at Ikonion, and
at Lustra – what persecutions I bore. Yet out of them all the Master delivered
me. 
2Tim
3:12  And indeed, all those wishing to
live reverently in Messiah יהושע, shall be persecuted.
2Tim
3:13  But evil men and impostors shall go
on to the worse, leading astray and being led astray.
2Tim
3:14  But you, stay in what you have
learned and trusted, having known from whom you have learned, 
2Tim
3:15  and that from a babe you have known
the Set-apart Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for deliverance
through belief in Messiah יהושע. 
2Tim
3:16  All Scripture is breathed by Elohim
and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for setting straight, for instruction
in righteousness, 
2Tim
3:17  that the man of Elohim might be
fitted, equipped for every good work. 
2Tim
4:1  In the sight of Elohim and the
Master יהושע Messiah, who shall judge the living
and the dead at His appearing and His reign, I earnestly charge you: 
2Tim
4:2  Proclaim the Word! Be urgent in
season, out of season. Reprove, warn, appeal, with all patience and teaching.
2Tim
4:3  For there shall be a time when they
shall not bear sound teaching, but according to their own desires, they shall
heap up for themselves teachers tickling the ear,
2Tim
4:4  and they shall indeed turn their
ears away from the truth, and be turned aside to myths. 
2Tim
4:5  But you be sober in all matters, suffer hardships, do the work
of an evangelist, accomplish your service completely. 
2Tim
4:6  For I am already being poured out,
and the time of my departure has arrived. 
2Tim
4:7  I have fought the good fight, I have
finished the race, I have guarded the belief. 
2Tim
4:8  For the rest, there is laid up for
me the crown of righteousness, which the Master, the righteous Judge, shall
give to me on that Day, and not to me only but also to all those loving His
appearing. 
2Tim
4:9  Do your best to come to me soon, 
2Tim
4:10  for Demas, having loved this
present world, has deserted me and went to Thessalonike, Crescens to Galatia,
Titus to Dalmatia. 
2Tim
4:11  Luke alone is with me. Take Mark
and bring him with you, for he is of good use to me for service. 
2Tim
4:12  And Tuchikos I have sent to
Ephesos. 
2Tim
4:13  Bring the cloak that I left with
Karpos at Troas when you come, and the books, especially the parchments. 
2Tim
4:14  Alexander the coppersmith did many
evils to me. The Master shall repay him according to his works.
2Tim
4:15  You, too, beware of him, for he strongly
opposed our words. 
2Tim
4:16  At my first defence no one stood
with me, but all forsook me. Let it not be held against them. 
2Tim
4:17  But the Master stood with me and
did strengthen me, so that through me the preaching might be completely accomplished,
and that all the gentiles should hear. And I was rescued out of the lion’s
mouth.
2Tim
4:18  And the Master shall rescue me from
every wicked work and save me for His heavenly reign. To Him be esteem forever
and ever. Amĕn! 
2Tim
4:19  Greet Prisca and Aqulas, and the
house of Onesiphoros. 
2Tim
4:20  Ĕrastos stayed in Corinth, but
I left Trophimos sick in Miletos. 
2Tim
4:21  Do your best to come before winter.
Eubulos greets you, and Pudes, and Linos, and Klaudia, and all the brothers. 
2Tim
4:22  The Master יהושע
Messiah be with your spirit. Favour be with you. Amĕn.
