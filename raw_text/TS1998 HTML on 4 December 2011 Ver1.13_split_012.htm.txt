Yehoshua/Joshua
Josh
1:1  And it came to be, after the death
of Mosheh the servant of יהוה, that יהוה
spoke to Yehoshua son of Nun, the assistant of Mosheh, saying,
Josh
1:2  “Mosheh My servant is dead, so now,
arise, pass over this Yardĕn, you and all this people, to the land which I
am giving to them, to the children of Yisra’ĕl. 
Josh
1:3  “Every place on which the sole of
your foot treads I have given you, as I spoke to Mosheh. 
Josh
1:4  “From the wilderness and this Leḇanon
even as far as the great river, the River Euphrates, all the land of the Ḥittites,
and to the Great Sea toward the going down of the sun, is your border. 
Josh
1:5  “No man is going to stand before you
all the days of your life. As I was with Mosheh, so I am with you. I do not
fail you nor forsake you. 
Josh
1:6  “Be strong and courageous, for you
are to let this people inherit the land which I swore to their fathers to give
them. 
Josh
1:7  “Only be strong and very courageous,
to guard to do according to all the Torah which Mosheh My servant commanded
you. Do not turn from it right or left, so that you act wisely wherever you go.

Josh
1:8  “Do not let this Book of the Torah
depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, so that you
guard to do according to all that is written in it. For then you shall make
your way prosperous, and act wisely. 
Josh
1:9  “Have I not commanded you? Be strong
and courageous. Do not be afraid, nor be discouraged, for יהוה
your Elohim is with you wherever you go.” 
Josh
1:10  And Yehoshua commanded the officers
of the people, saying, 
Josh
1:11  “Pass through the midst of the camp
and command the people, saying, ‘Prepare food for yourselves, for within three
days you are passing over this Yardĕn, to go in to possess the land which יהוה
your Elohim is giving you to possess.’ ” 
Josh
1:12  And Yehoshua spoke to the Re’uḇĕnites
and to the Gaḏites and to half the tribe of Menashsheh, saying, 
Josh
1:13  “Remember the word which Mosheh,
servant of יהוה, commanded you, saying, ‘ יהוה
your Elohim is giving you rest, and He shall give you this land.’ 
Josh
1:14  “Let your wives, your little ones,
and your livestock stay in the land which Mosheh gave you beyond the Yardĕn.
But you shall pass before your brothers in fives, all your brave fighters, and
shall help them, 
Josh
1:15  until יהוה
has given your brothers rest, as unto you. So shall they also take possession
of the land which יהוה your Elohim is giving them. Then
you shall return to the land of your possession, and shall possess that which
Mosheh the servant of יהוה gave you beyond the Yardĕn
toward the rising of the sun.” 
Josh
1:16  And they answered Yehoshua, saying,
“All that you have commanded us we do, and wherever you send us we go. 
Josh
1:17  “According to all that we obeyed
Mosheh, so we obey you. Only, let יהוה your Elohim be
with you, as He was with Mosheh. 
Josh
1:18  “Whoever rebels against your
command and does not obey your words, in all that you command him, is put to
death. Only be strong and courageous.” 
Josh
2:1  And Yehoshua son of Nun secretly
sent out two men from Shittim to spy, saying, “Go, see the land, and
Yeriḥo.” And they went, and came to the house of a woman, a whore, and
her name was Raḥaḇ, and they lay down there. 
Josh
2:2  But it was reported to the sovereign
of Yeriḥo, saying, “See, men from the children of Yisra’ĕl have come
here tonight to search out the land.” 
Josh
2:3  And the sovereign of Yeriḥo
sent to Raḥaḇ, saying, “Bring out the men who have come to you, who
have entered your house, for they have come to search out all the land.” 
Josh
2:4  But the woman had taken the two men
and hid them. So she said, “The men came to me, but I did not know where they
were from. 
Josh
2:5  “Then it came to be as the gate was
being shut, when it was dark, that the men went out. I do not know where the
men went. Pursue them quickly, so that you overtake them.” 
Josh
2:6  But she had brought them up to the
roof and hidden them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid out on the
roof. 
Josh
2:7  And the men pursued them by the way
to the Yardĕn, to the fords. And they shut the gate afterwards as soon as
the pursuers had gone out. 
Josh
2:8  And before they lay down, she came
up to them on the roof, 
Josh
2:9  and she said to the men, “I know
that יהוה has given you the land, and that the fear of
you has fallen on us, and that all the inhabitants of the land melt away
because of you. 
Josh
2:10  “For we have heard how יהוה
dried up the water of the Sea of Reeds for you when you came out of Mitsrayim,
and what you did to the two sovereigns of the Amorites who were beyond the Yardĕn,
Siḥon and Oḡ, whom you put under the ban. 
Josh
2:11  “And when we heard, our hearts
melted, and there was no spirit left in anyone because of you, for יהוה
your Elohim, He is Elohim in the heavens above and on earth beneath. 
Josh
2:12  “And now, please swear to me by יהוה,
since I have shown you kindness, that you also show kindness to my father’s
house, and shall give me a true token, 
Josh
2:13  and shall spare my father, and my
mother, and my brothers, and my sisters, and all that they have, and shall
deliver our lives from death.” 
Josh
2:14  And the men said to her, “Our lives
for yours, if you do not expose this matter of ours, then it shall be, when יהוה
has given us the land, that we shall treat you in kindness and truth.” 
Josh
2:15  So she let them down by a rope
through the window, for her house was on the city wall and she dwelt on the
wall. 
Josh
2:16  And she said to them, “Go to the
mountain, lest the pursuers come upon you. And you shall hide there three days,
until the pursuers have returned, and afterwards go on your way.” 
Josh
2:17  And the men said to her, “We are
released from this oath of yours which you have made us swear, 
Josh
2:18  unless, when we come into the land,
you bind this line of scarlet cord in the window through which you let us down,
and unless you bring your father, and your mother, and your brothers, and all
your father’s household to your own home. 
Josh
2:19  “And it shall be that anyone who
goes outside the doors of your house into the street, his blood is on his own
head, and we are innocent. And anyone who is with you in the house, his blood
is on our head if a hand is laid on him. 
Josh
2:20  “And if you expose this matter of
ours, then we shall be released from your oath which you made us swear.” 
Josh
2:21  And she said, “Let it be according
to your words.” And she sent them away, and they went. And she bound the
scarlet cord in the window. 
Josh
2:22  So they left and came to the
mountain, and stayed there three days until the pursuers returned. And the
pursuers sought them in all the way, but did not find them. 
Josh
2:23  Then the two men returned and came
down from the mountain, and passed over. And they came to Yehoshua son of Nun,
and related to him all that had befallen them. 
Josh
2:24  And they said to Yehoshua, “Truly יהוה
has given all the land into our hands, and also, all the inhabitants of the
land have melted away because of us.” 
Josh
3:1  And Yehoshua rose early in the
morning, and they set out from Shittim and came to the Yardĕn, he and all
the children of Yisra’ĕl, and stayed there before they passed over. 
Josh
3:2  And it came to be, after three days,
that the officers went into the midst of the camp, 
Josh
3:3  and they commanded the people,
saying, “When you see the ark of the covenant of יהוה
your Elohim, and the priests, the Lĕwites, bearing it, then you shall set
out from your place and follow it. 
Josh
3:4  “Only, keep a distance between you
and it, about two thousand cubits by measure. Do not come near it, so that you
know which way to go, for you have not passed over this way before.” 
Josh
3:5  And Yehoshua said to the people, “Set
yourselves apart, for tomorrow יהוה is doing wonders in
your midst.” 
Josh
3:6  And Yehoshua spoke to the priests,
saying, “Take up the ark of the covenant and pass over before the people.” So
they took up the ark of the covenant and went before the people. 
Josh
3:7  And יהוה
said to Yehoshua, “This day I begin to make you great before the eyes of all
Yisra’ĕl, so that they know that I am with you as I was with Mosheh. 
Josh
3:8  “And you, command the priests who
bear the ark of the covenant, saying, ‘When you come to the edge of the water
of the Yardĕn, stand in the Yardĕn.’ ” 
Josh
3:9  And Yehoshua said to the children of
Yisra’ĕl, “Come near, and hear the words of יהוה
your Elohim.” 
Josh
3:10  And Yehoshua said, “By this you
shall know that the living Ĕl is in your midst, and that He is certainly
driving out from before you the Kena‛anites and the Ḥittites and
the Ḥiwwites and the Perizzites and the Girgashites and the Amorites and
the Yeḇusites: 
Josh
3:11  “See, the ark of the covenant of
the Master of all the earth is passing over before you into the Yardĕn. 
Josh
3:12  “And now, take for yourselves
twelve men from the tribes of Yisra’ĕl, one man from every tribe. 
Josh
3:13  “And it shall be, as soon as the
soles of the feet of the priests who bear the ark of יהוה,
the Master of all the earth, come to rest in the waters of the Yardĕn,
that the waters of the Yardĕn are cut off, the waters that come down from
upstream, and stand as a heap.” 
Josh
3:14  And it came to be, when the people
set out from their tents to pass over the Yardĕn, with the priests bearing
the ark of the covenant before the people, 
Josh
3:15  and as those bearing the ark came
to the Yardĕn, and the feet of the priests bearing the ark dipped in the
edge of the water – now the Yardĕn overflows all its banks during all the
time of harvest – 
Josh
3:16  that the waters which came down
from upstream stood still, and rose in a heap very far away at Aḏam, the
city that is beside Tsarethan. And the waters going down into the Sea of the
Araḇah, the Salt Sea, were completely cut off. And the people passed over
opposite Yeriḥo. 
Josh
3:17  And the priests bearing the ark of
the covenant of יהוה stood firm on dry ground in the
midst of the Yardĕn. And all Yisra’ĕl passed over on dry ground,
until all the nation had completely passed over the Yardĕn. 
Josh
4:1  And it came to be, when the entire
nation had completely passed over the Yardĕn, that יהוה
spoke to Yehoshua, saying, 
Josh
4:2  “Take for yourselves twelve men from
the people, one man from every tribe, 
Josh
4:3  and command them, saying, ‘Take for
yourselves twelve stones from here, out of the midst of the Yardĕn, from
the place where the priests’ feet stood firm. And you shall bring them with you
and leave them in the camp in which you spend the night.’ ” 
Josh
4:4  And Yehoshua called the twelve men
whom he had appointed from the children of Yisra’ĕl, one man from every
tribe, 
Josh
4:5  and Yehoshua said to them, “Pass
over before the ark of יהוה your Elohim into the midst
of the Yardĕn, and each one of you take up a stone on his shoulder,
according to the number of the tribes of the children of Yisra’ĕl, 
Josh
4:6  so that this shall be a sign in your
midst when your children ask in time to come, saying, ‘What do these stones
mean to you?’ 
Josh
4:7  “Then you shall answer them that the
waters of the Yardĕn were cut off before the ark of the covenant of יהוה.
When it passed over the Yardĕn, the waters of the Yardĕn were cut
off. And these stones shall be for a remembrance to the children of Yisra’ĕl
forever.” 
Josh
4:8  And the children of Yisra’ĕl
did so, as Yehoshua commanded, and took up twelve stones from the midst of the
Yardĕn, as יהוה had spoken to Yehoshua, according
to the number of the tribes of the children of Yisra’ĕl, and took them
over with them to their camp, and laid them down there. 
Josh
4:9  Yehoshua also set up twelve stones
in the midst of the Yardĕn, in the place where the feet of the priests who
bore the ark of the covenant stood. And they are there to this day. 
Josh
4:10  And the priests who bore the ark
stood in the midst of the Yardĕn until every matter was finished that יהוה
had commanded Yehoshua to speak to the people, according to all that Mosheh had
commanded Yehoshua. And the people hastened and passed over. 
Josh
4:11  And it came to be, when all the
people had completely passed over, that the ark of יהוה
and the priests passed over in the presence of the people. 
Josh
4:12  And the sons of Re’uḇĕn,
and the sons of Gaḏ, and half the tribe of Menashsheh passed over in
fives before the children of Yisra’ĕl, as Mosheh had spoken to them. 
Josh
4:13  About forty thousand armed ones of
the army passed over before יהוה for battle, to the
desert plains of Yeriḥo. 
Josh
4:14  On that day יהוה
made Yehoshua great before the eyes of all Yisra’ĕl. And they feared him,
as they had feared Mosheh, all the days of his life. 
Josh
4:15  And יהוה
spoke to Yehoshua, saying, 
Josh
4:16  “Command the priests who bear the
ark of the Witness, and let them come up from the Yardĕn.” 
Josh
4:17  And Yehoshua commanded the priests,
saying, “Come up from the Yardĕn.” 
Josh
4:18  And it came to be, when the priests
who bore the ark of the covenant of יהוה had come from
the midst of the Yardĕn, and the soles of the priests’ feet touched the
dry land, that the waters of the Yardĕn returned to their place and flowed
over all its banks as before. 
Josh
4:19  And the people came up from the
Yardĕn on the tenth day of the first month, and they camped in Gilgal on
the east border of Yeriḥo. 
Josh
4:20  And those twelve stones which they
took out of the Yardĕn, Yehoshua set up in Gilgal. 
Josh
4:21  And he said to the children of Yisra’ĕl,
saying, “When your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, ‘What
are these stones?’ 
Josh
4:22  then you shall let your children
know, saying, ‘Yisra’ĕl passed over this Yardĕn on dry land,’ 
Josh
4:23  for יהוה
your Elohim dried up the waters of the Yardĕn before you until you had
passed over, as יהוה your Elohim did to the Sea of
Reeds, which He dried up before us until we had passed over, 
Josh
4:24  so that all the peoples of the
earth shall know the hand of יהוה, that it is strong,
so that you shall fear יהוה your Elohim forever.” 
Josh
5:1  And it came to be, when all the
sovereigns of the Amorites who were beyond the Yardĕn westward, and all
the sovereigns of the Kena‛anites who were by the sea, heard that יהוה
had dried up the waters of the Yardĕn from before the children of Yisra’ĕl
until we had passed over, that their heart melted. And there was no spirit in
them any longer, because of the children of Yisra’ĕl. 
Josh
5:2  At that time יהוה
said to Yehoshua, “Make knives of flint for yourself, and circumcise the sons
of Yisra’ĕl again the second time.” 
Josh
5:3  So Yehoshua made knives of flint for
himself, and circumcised the sons of Yisra’ĕl at the Hill of Foreskins. 
Josh
5:4  And this is why Yehoshua circumcised
them: All the people who came out of Mitsrayim who were males, all the men of
battle, had died in the wilderness on the way, after they had come out of
Mitsrayim. 
Josh
5:5  For all the people who came out had
been circumcised, but all the people who were born in the wilderness on the way
as they came out of Mitsrayim had not been circumcised. 
Josh
5:6  For the children of Yisra’ĕl
walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the nation – the men of battle
who came out of Mitsrayim – were consumed, because they did not obey the voice
of יהוה, to whom יהוה swore not
to show them the land which יהוה had sworn to their
fathers that He would give us, “a land flowing with milk and honey.” 
Josh
5:7  And Yehoshua circumcised their sons
whom He raised up in their place; for they were uncircumcised, because they had
not been circumcised on the way. 
Josh
5:8  And it came to be, when they had
completed circumcising all the nation, that they stayed in their places in the
camp till they were healed. 
Josh
5:9  And יהוה
said to Yehoshua, “Today I have rolled away the reproach of Mitsrayim from you.”
So the name of the place is called Gilgal to this day. 
Josh
5:10  And the children of Yisra’ĕl
camped in Gilgal, and performed the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month
at evening on the desert plains of Yeriḥo. 
Josh
5:11  And they ate of the stored grain of
the land on the morrow after the Passover, unleavened bread and roasted grain
on this same day. 
Josh
5:12  And the manna ceased on the day
after they had eaten the stored grain of the land. And the children of Yisra’ĕl
no longer had manna, but they ate the food of the land of Kena‛an that
year. 
Josh
5:13  And it came to be, when Yehoshua
was by Yeriḥo, that he lifted his eyes and looked and saw a Man standing
opposite him with His sword drawn in His hand. And Yehoshua went to Him and
said to Him, “Are You for us or for our adversaries?” 
Josh
5:14  And He said, “No, for I have now
come as Captain of the host of יהוה.” And Yehoshua fell
on his face to the earth and did obeisance, and said to Him, “What is my Master
saying to His servant?” 
Josh
5:15  And the Captain of the host of יהוה
said to Yehoshua, “Take your sandal off your foot, for the place where you
stand is set-apart.” And Yehoshua did so. 
Josh
6:1  And Yeriḥo was shut up tight
because of the presence of the sons of Yisra’ĕl – none going out, and none
coming in. 
Josh
6:2  And יהוה
said to Yehoshua, “See! I have given Yeriḥo and its sovereign, mighty
brave men, into your hand. 
Josh
6:3  “And you shall go around the city,
all the men of battle going around the city once. Do this for six days. 
Josh
6:4  “And let seven priests bear seven
rams’ horns before the ark, and on the seventh day go around the city seven
times while the priests blow the horns. 
Josh
6:5  “And it shall be, when they make a
long blast with the ram’s horn, and when you hear the sound of the horn, that
all the people shout with a great shout. And the wall of the city shall fall
down flat, and the people shall go up every man straight before him.” 
Josh
6:6  And Yehoshua son of Nun called the
priests and said to them, “Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven
priests bear seven rams’ horns before the ark of יהוה.”

Josh
6:7  And he said to the people, “Pass
over, and go around the city, and let him who is armed pass over before the ark
of יהוה.” 
Josh
6:8  And it came to be, when Yehoshua had
spoken to the people, that the seven priests bearing the seven rams’ horns
before יהוה passed over and blew the horns, and the ark
of the covenant of יהוה went after them. 
Josh
6:9  And the armed men went before the
priests who blew the horns, and the rear guard came after the ark, going on and
blowing the horns. 
Josh
6:10  But Yehoshua had commanded the
people, saying, “Do not shout or cause your voice to be heard, nor let any word
come out of your mouth, until the day I say to you, ‘Shout!’ Then you shall
shout.” 
Josh
6:11  And the ark of יהוה
went around the city, going around once. And they came into the camp and stayed
in the camp. 
Josh
6:12  And Yehoshua rose early in the
morning, and the priests took up the ark of יהוה. 
Josh
6:13  And seven priests bearing seven
rams’ horns before the ark of יהוה were walking, going
on, and they blew the horns, and the armed men went before them. But the rear
guard came after the ark of יהוה, going on, and blowing
the horns. 
Josh
6:14  And the second day they went around
the city once and returned to the camp. Thus they did six days. 
Josh
6:15  And it came to be on the seventh
day that they rose early, about the dawning of the day, and went around the
city seven times in this way. Only on that day they went around the city seven
times. 
Josh
6:16  And it came to be at the seventh
time, when the priests blew the horns, that Yehoshua said to the people, “Shout,
for יהוה has given you the city! 
Josh
6:17  “And the city shall be put under
the ban, it and all that is in it belongs to יהוה. Only
Raḥaḇ the whore is to live, she and all who are with her in the
house, because she hid the messengers that we sent. 
Josh
6:18  “And you, by all means guard
yourselves from that which is under the ban, lest you come under the ban when
you take of that which is under the ban, and make the camp of Yisra’ĕl a
curse, and shall trouble it. 
Josh
6:19  “But all the silver and gold, and
vessels of bronze and iron, are set-apart to יהוה, they
go into the treasury of יהוה.” 
Josh
6:20  And the people shouted when the
priests blew the horns. And it came to be when the people heard the sound of
the horn, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down
flat. And the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and
they captured the city. 
Josh
6:21  And they put under the ban all that
was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox and sheep and
donkey, with the edge of the sword. 
Josh
6:22  And to the two men who had spied
out the land Yehoshua said, “Go into the house of the woman, the whore, and
from there bring out the woman and all that she has, as you swore to her.” 
Josh
6:23  And the young men, the spies, went
in and brought out Raḥaḇ, and her father, and her mother, and her
brothers, and all that she had. So they brought out all her relatives and set
them outside the camp of Yisra’ĕl. 
Josh
6:24  And they burned the city and all
that was in it with fire. Only the silver and gold, and the vessels of bronze
and of iron, they put into the treasury of the House of יהוה.

Josh
6:25  However, Yehoshua kept alive
Raḥaḇ the whore, and her father’s household, and all that she had.
And she dwelt in the midst of Yisra’ĕl to this day, because she hid the
messengers whom Yehoshua sent to spy out Yeriḥo. 
Josh
6:26  And Yehoshua warned them at that
time, saying, “Cursed is the man before יהוה who rises
up and builds this city Yeriḥo – he lays its foundation with his
first-born, and with his youngest he sets up its gates.” 
Josh
6:27  And יהוה
was with Yehoshua, and a report about him was in all the land. 
Josh
7:1  But the children of Yisra’ĕl
committed a trespass regarding that which is under the ban, for Aḵan son
of Karmi, son of Zaḇdi, son of Zeraḥ, of the tribe of Yehuḏah,
took of that which is under the ban. And the displeasure of יהוה
burned against the children of Yisra’ĕl. 
Josh
7:2  Now Yehoshua sent men from
Yeriḥo to Ai, which is beside Bĕyth Awen, on the east side of Bĕyth
Ĕl, and spoke to them, saying, “Go up and spy out the land.” And the men
went up and spied out Ai. 
Josh
7:3  And they returned to Yehoshua and
said to him, “Let not all the people go up, but let about two or three thousand
men go up and smite Ai. Do not make all the people toil up there, for the
people of Ai are few.” 
Josh
7:4  And about three thousand men went up
there from the people, but they fled before the men of Ai. 
Josh
7:5  And the men of Ai smote about
thirty-six men, for they pursued them from before the gate as far as Sheḇarim,
and smote them on the descent. So the hearts of the people melted and became
like water. 
Josh
7:6  And Yehoshua tore his garments, and
fell to the earth on his face before the ark of יהוה
until evening, both he and the elders of Yisra’ĕl, and they put dust on
their heads. 
Josh
7:7  And Yehoshua said, “Oh Master יהוה,
why have You brought this people over the Yardĕn at all, to give us into
the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? If only we had been content to stay
beyond the Yardĕn! 
Josh
7:8  “O יהוה,
what do I say when Yisra’ĕl turns its back before its enemies, 
Josh
7:9  and the Kena‛anites and all
the inhabitants of the land hear, and shall surround us, and cut off our name
from the earth. What then do You do for Your great Name?” 
Josh
7:10  And יהוה
said to Yehoshua, “Rise up! Why are you lying on your face? 
Josh
7:11  “Yisra’ĕl has sinned, and they
have also transgressed My covenant which I commanded them. And they have even
taken some of that which is under the ban, and have both stolen and deceived,
and also put it among their own goods. 
Josh
7:12  “And the sons of Yisra’ĕl
shall not be able to stand before their enemies. They are going to turn their
backs before their enemies, for they have become accursed. I am not with you
any more, unless you destroy that which is under the ban from your midst.  
Josh
7:13  “Rise up, set the people apart, and
you shall say, ‘Set yourselves apart for tomorrow, because thus said יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, “That which is under the ban is in your midst, O Yisra’ĕl.
You are not able to stand before your enemies until you put away that which is
under the ban out of your midst.” 
Josh
7:14  ‘And you shall be brought near in
the morning, according to your tribes. And it shall be, the tribe which יהוה
takes comes according to clans. And the clan which יהוה
takes comes by households. And the household which יהוה
takes comes by men. 
Josh
7:15  ‘And it shall be that he who is taken
with that which is under the ban is burned with fire, he and all that he has,
because he has transgressed the covenant of יהוה, and
because he has committed wickedness in Yisra’ĕl.’ ” 
Josh
7:16  So Yehoshua arose early in the
morning and brought Yisra’ĕl by their tribes, and the tribe of Yehuḏah
was taken, 
Josh
7:17  and he brought the clan of Yehuḏah,
and he took the clan of the Zarḥites. And he brought the clan of the
Zarḥites by men, and Zaḇdi was taken. 
Josh
7:18  And he brought his household by
men, and Aḵan son of Karmi, son of Zaḇdi, son of Zeraḥ, of
the tribe of Yehuḏah, was taken. 
Josh
7:19  Then Yehoshua said to Aḵan, “My
son, now give esteem to יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl,
and make confession to Him. And please declare to me what you have done, do not
hide it from me.” 
Josh
7:20  So Aḵan answered Yehoshua and
said, “Truly, I have sinned against יהוה Elohim of
Yisra’ĕl, and this is what I did: 
Josh
7:21  “When I saw among the spoil a
lovely garment from Shin‛ar, and two hundred sheqels of silver, and a
wedge of gold weighing fifty sheqels, I coveted them and took them. And see,
they are hidden in the ground in the midst of my tent, with the silver under
it.” 
Josh
7:22  And Yehoshua sent messengers, and
they ran to the tent. And see, it was hidden in his tent, with the silver under
it. 
Josh
7:23  And they took them from the midst
of the tent, brought them to Yehoshua and to all the children of Yisra’ĕl,
and laid them out before יהוה. 
Josh
7:24  Then Yehoshua, and all Yisra’ĕl
with him, took Aḵan son of Zeraḥ, and the silver, and the garment,
and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his
donkeys, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had, and they brought
them to the Valley of Aḵor. 
Josh
7:25  And Yehoshua said, “Why have you
troubled us? יהוה does trouble you today!” Then all
Yisra’ĕl stoned him with stones. And they burned them with fire after they
had stoned them with stones. 
Josh
7:26  And they raised over him a great
heap of stones, which remains to this day. Then יהוה
turned from the fierceness of His displeasure. Therefore the name of that place
has been called the Valley of Aḵor to this day. 
Josh
8:1  And יהוה
said to Yehoshua, “Do not be afraid, nor be discouraged. Take all the soldiers
with you, and arise, go up to Ai. See, I have given into your hand the
sovereign of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land. 
Josh
8:2  “So you shall do to Ai and its
sovereign as you did to Yeriḥo and its sovereign. Only its spoil and its
livestock you take as plunder for yourselves. Set for yourselves an ambush for
the city, behind it.” 
Josh
8:3  And Yehoshua and all the soldiers
rose up, to go up to Ai. And Yehoshua chose thirty thousand mighty brave men
and sent them away by night, 
Josh
8:4  and commanded them, saying, “See,
you are going to lie in ambush against the city, behind the city. Do not go
very far from the city, but all of you shall be prepared, 
Josh
8:5  while I and all the people who are
with me approach the city. And it shall be, when they come out against us, as
formerly, that we shall flee before them, 
Josh
8:6  and they shall come out after us
till we have drawn them from the city, as though saying, ‘They are fleeing
before us as formerly.’ And we shall flee before them, 
Josh
8:7  then you shall rise from the ambush
and seize the city. And יהוה your Elohim shall give it
into your hand. 
Josh
8:8  “And it shall be, when you capture
the city, that you burn the city with fire. Do according to the word of יהוה.
See, I have commanded you.” 
Josh
8:9  And Yehoshua sent them out. And they
went to lie in ambush, and stayed between Bĕyth Ĕl and Ai, on the
west side of Ai. But Yehoshua stayed that night in the midst of the people. 
Josh
8:10  And Yehoshua rose up early in the
morning and inspected the people, and went up, he and the elders of Yisra’ĕl,
before the people to Ai. 
Josh
8:11  And all the soldiers who were with
him went up and drew near, and came before the city and camped on the north
side of Ai, with the valley between them and Ai. 
Josh
8:12  And he took about five thousand men
and set them in ambush between Bĕyth Ĕl and Ai, on the west side of
the city. 
Josh
8:13  So they stationed the people, all
the army that was on the north of the city, and its rear guard on the west of
the city, and Yehoshua went that night into the midst of the valley. 
Josh
8:14  And it came to be, when the
sovereign of Ai saw it, that the men of the city hastened and rose up early and
went out against Yisra’ĕl to battle, he and all his people, at an appointed
place before the desert plain. But he did not know that there was an ambush
against him behind the city.
Josh
8:15  And Yehoshua and all Yisra’ĕl
let themselves be beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.
Josh
8:16  And all the people who were in Ai
were called together to pursue them. And they pursued Yehoshua and were drawn
away from the city. 
Josh
8:17  So there was not a man left in Ai
or Bĕyth Ĕl who did not go out after Yisra’ĕl, and they left the
city open and pursued Yisra’ĕl. 
Josh
8:18  And יהוה
said to Yehoshua, “Stretch out the spear that is in your hand toward Ai, for I
give it into your hand.” And Yehoshua stretched out the spear that he had in
his hand toward the city, 
Josh
8:19  and the ambush rose up quickly from
their place, and they ran at the stretching out of his hand, and entered the
city and took it, and hastened to burn the city with fire. 
Josh
8:20  And the men of Ai looked behind
them and saw the smoke of the city rising to the heavens. And there was no power
in them to flee this way or that way, for the people who had fled to the
wilderness turned back on the pursuers. 
Josh
8:21  For when Yehoshua and all Yisra’ĕl
saw that the ambush had captured the city and that the smoke of the city went
up, they turned back and smote the men of Ai. 
Josh
8:22  The others also came out of the
city against them, so they were in the midst of Yisra’ĕl, some on this
side and some on that side. And they smote them until none were left, and none
had escaped. 
Josh
8:23  But the sovereign of Ai they caught
alive, and brought him to Yehoshua. 
Josh
8:24  And it came to be, when Yisra’ĕl
ended slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness where
they pursued them, and when they all had fallen by the edge of the sword until
they were consumed, that all the Yisra’ĕlites returned to Ai and smote it
with the edge of the sword. 
Josh
8:25  And it came to be that all who fell
that day, both men and women, were twelve thousand – all men of Ai. 
Josh
8:26  And Yehoshua did not draw back his
hand, with which he stretched out the spear, until he had put all the
inhabitants of Ai under the ban. 
Josh
8:27  Only the livestock and the spoil of
that city Yisra’ĕl took as booty for themselves, according to the word of יהוה
which He had commanded Yehoshua. 
Josh
8:28  And Yehoshua burned Ai and made it
a heap forever, a ruin to this day. 
Josh
8:29  And he hanged the sovereign of Ai
on a tree until evening. And at sunset Yehoshua commanded that they should take
his corpse down from the tree, and throw it at the entrance of the gate of the
city, and raise over it a great heap of stones, to this day. 
Josh
8:30  And Yehoshua built an altar to יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl in Mount Ĕyḇal, 
Josh
8:31  as Mosheh the servant of יהוה
had commanded the children of Yisra’ĕl, as it is written in the Book of
the Torah of Mosheh, “an altar of unhewn stones over which no man has wielded
iron.” And they offered on it burnt offerings to יהוה,
and slaughtered peace offerings. 
Josh
8:32  And there, in the presence of the
children of Yisra’ĕl, he wrote on the stones a copy of the Torah of
Mosheh, which he had written. 
Josh
8:33  And all Yisra’ĕl – the
sojourner as well as the native – with their elders and officers and judges,
stood on either side of the ark before the priests, the Lĕwites, who bore
the ark of the covenant of יהוה. Half of them were in
front of Mount Gerizim and half of them in front of Mount Ĕyḇal, as
Mosheh the servant of יהוה had commanded before, that
they should bless the people of Yisra’ĕl. 
Josh
8:34  And afterward he read all the words
of the Torah, the blessings and the cursings, according to all that is written
in the Book of the Torah. 
Josh
8:35  There was not a word of all that
Mosheh had commanded which Yehoshua did not read before all the assembly of
Yisra’ĕl, with the women, and the little ones, and the sojourners who
accompanied them. 
Josh
9:1  And it came to be, when all the
sovereigns who were beyond the Yardĕn, in the hills and in the low country
and in all the coasts of the Great Sea toward Leḇanon – the Ḥittite
and the Amorite, the Kena‛anite and the Perizzite, the Ḥiwwite and
the Yeḇusite – heard, 
Josh
9:2  they gathered together to fight with
Yehoshua and Yisra’ĕl with one accord. 
Josh
9:3  And the inhabitants of Giḇ‛on
heard what Yehoshua had done to Yeriḥo and Ai, 
Josh
9:4  and they acted slyly and went and
pretended to be envoys. And they took old sacks on their donkeys, old wineskins
torn and mended, 
Josh
9:5  and old and patched sandals on their
feet, and old garments on themselves. And all the bread of their provision was
dry, it was crumbs. 
Josh
9:6  And they went to Yehoshua, to the
camp at Gilgal, and said to him and to the men of Yisra’ĕl, “We have come
from a far land, and now, make a covenant with us.” 
Josh
9:7  But the men of Yisra’ĕl said to
the Ḥiwwites, “It could be that you dwell in our midst, so how would we
make a covenant with you?” 
Josh
9:8  And they said to Yehoshua, “We are
your servants.” And Yehoshua said to them, “Who are you, and where do you come
from?” 
Josh
9:9  So they said to him, “From a land
very far off your servants have come, because of the Name of יהוה
your Elohim. For we have heard the report of Him, and all that He did in
Mitsrayim, 
Josh
9:10  and all that He had done to the two
sovereigns of the Amorites who were beyond the Yardĕn, to Siḥon
sovereign of Ḥeshbon, and Oḡ sovereign of Bashan, who was at
Ashtaroth. 
Josh
9:11  “So our elders and all the
inhabitants of our land spoke to us, saying, ‘Take food with you for the
journey, and go to meet them, and say to them, “We are your servants, and now,
make a covenant with us.” ’ 
Josh
9:12  “This bread of ours we took hot for
our provision from our houses on the day that we left to come to you. But now,
see, it is dry and it is crumby. 
Josh
9:13  “And these wineskins which we
filled were new, and see, they are torn. And these our garments and our sandals
have become old because of the very long journey.” 
Josh
9:14  And the men of Yisra’ĕl took
some of their food, but they did not ask the mouth of יהוה.

Josh
9:15  And Yehoshua made peace with them,
and made a covenant with them to let them live, and the rulers of the
congregation swore to them. 
Josh
9:16  And it came to be at the end of
three days, after they had made a covenant with them, that they heard that they
were their neighbours who dwelt near them. 
Josh
9:17  And the children of Yisra’ĕl
set out and came to their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Giḇ‛on,
and Kephirah, and Be’ĕroth, and Qiryath Ye‛arim. 
Josh
9:18  But the children of Yisra’ĕl
did not smite them, because the rulers of the congregation had sworn to them by
יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl. And all the congregation
grumbled against the rulers. 
Josh
9:19  But all the rulers said to all the
congregation, “We have sworn to them by יהוה Elohim of
Yisra’ĕl, and we are unable to touch them now. 
Josh
9:20  “Let us do this to them: We shall
keep them alive, lest wrath be upon us because of the oath which we swore to
them.” 
Josh
9:21  And the rulers said to them, “Let
them live, but let them be woodcutters and drawers of water for all the
congregation, as the rulers had promised them.” 
Josh
9:22  Then Yehoshua called for them, and he
spoke to them, saying, “Why have you deceived us, saying, ‘We are very far from
you,’ yet you are dwelling in our midst? 
Josh
9:23  “And now you are cursed, and you
shall not cease from being slaves, and woodcutters and drawers of water for the
House of my Elohim.” 
Josh
9:24  And they answered Yehoshua and
said, “Your servants were clearly told that יהוה your
Elohim commanded His servant Mosheh to give you all the land, and to destroy
all the inhabitants of the land from before you. So we were very much afraid
for our lives because of you, and have done this deed. 
Josh
9:25  “And now, see, we are in your
hands. Do with us as it seems good and right to do to us.”
Josh
9:26  And he did so to them, and
delivered them out of the hand of the children of Yisra’ĕl, and they did
not kill them. 
Josh
9:27  And that day Yehoshua made them
woodcutters and drawers of water for the congregation and for the altar of יהוה,
even to this day, at the place that He should choose. 
Josh
10:1  And it came to be when Aḏoni-Tseḏeq
sovereign of Yerushalayim heard that Yehoshua had captured Ai and had put it
under the ban, that he had done to Ai and its sovereign as he had done to
Yeriḥo and its sovereign, and that the inhabitants of Giḇ‛on
had made peace with Yisra’ĕl and were in their midst, 
Josh
10:2  that they feared greatly, because
Giḇ‛on was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it
was greater than Ai, and all its men were mighty. 
Josh
10:3  And Aḏoni-Tseḏeq
sovereign of Yerushalayim sent to Hoham sovereign of Ḥeḇron, and to
Piram sovereign of Yarmuth, and to Yaphiya sovereign of Laḵish, and to Deḇir
sovereign of Eḡlon, saying, 
Josh
10:4  “Come up to me and help me, and let
us smite Giḇ‛on, for it has made peace with Yehoshua and with the
children of Yisra’ĕl.” 
Josh
10:5  So the five sovereigns of the
Amorites – the sovereign of Yerushalayim, the sovereign of Ḥeḇron,
the sovereign of Yarmuth, the sovereign of Laḵish, the sovereign of Eḡlon
– gathered together and went up, they and all their armies, and camped before
Giḇ‛on and fought against it. 
Josh
10:6  And the men of Giḇ‛on
sent to Yehoshua at the camp at Gilgal, saying, “Do not withdraw your hand from
your servants. Come up to us quickly, and save us and help us, for all the
sovereigns of the Amorites who dwell in the mountains have assembled against
us.” 
Josh
10:7  And Yehoshua went up from Gilgal,
he and all the soldiers with him, and all the mighty brave men. 
Josh
10:8  And יהוה
said to Yehoshua, “Do not fear them, for I have given them into your hand. Not
one of them does stand before you.” 
Josh
10:9  So then Yehoshua came upon them
suddenly, having gone up all night from Gilgal. 
Josh
10:10  And יהוה
threw them into confusion before Yisra’ĕl, and they smote them with a
great slaughter at Giḇ‛on, and pursued them along the way that goes
to Bĕyth Ḥoron, and smote them as far as Azĕqah and Maqqĕḏah.

Josh
10:11  And it came to be, as they fled
before Yisra’ĕl and were on the descent of Bĕyth Ḥoron, that יהוה
threw down large hailstones from the heavens on them as far as Azĕqah, and
they died. There were more who died from the hailstones than those whom the
sons of Yisra’ĕl had slain with the sword. 
Josh
10:12  Then Yehoshua spoke to יהוה
in the day when יהוה gave the Amorites over to the children
of Yisra’ĕl, and he said before the eyes of Yisra’ĕl, “Sun, stand
still over Giḇ‛on; and moon, in the Valley of Ayalon.” 
Josh
10:13  So the sun stood still, and the
moon stopped, till the nation avenged itself upon their enemies. Is this not
written in the Book of Yashar? Thus the sun stopped in the midst of the
heavens, and did not hasten to go down for an entire day. 
Josh
10:14  And there has been no day like
that, before it or after it, that יהוה listened to the
voice of a man, because יהוה fought for Yisra’ĕl. 
Josh
10:15  So Yehoshua returned, and all
Yisra’ĕl with him, to the camp at Gilgal. 
Josh
10:16  Now these five sovereigns had fled
and hidden themselves in a cave at Maqqĕḏah. 
Josh
10:17  And it was reported to Yehoshua,
saying, “The five sovereigns have been found hidden in the cave at Maqqĕḏah.”

Josh
10:18  And Yehoshua said, “Roll large
stones against the mouth of the cave, and set men by it to guard them. 
Josh
10:19  “And you, do not stand still, but
pursue your enemies. And you shall smite them in the rear. Do not allow them to
enter their cities, for יהוה your Elohim has given them
into your hand.” 
Josh
10:20  And it came to be, when Yehoshua
and the children of Yisra’ĕl had ended smiting them with a very great
slaughter, till they had finished – but those who escaped went into walled
cities – 
Josh
10:21  that all the people returned to
the camp, to Yehoshua at Maqqĕḏah, in peace. No one moved his tongue
against any of the sons of Yisra’ĕl. 
Josh
10:22  Then Yehoshua said, “Open the
mouth of the cave, and bring out those five sovereigns to me from the cave.” 
Josh
10:23  And they did so, and brought those
five sovereigns to him from the cave: the sovereign of Yerushalayim, the
sovereign of Ḥeḇron, the sovereign of Yarmuth, the sovereign of Laḵish,
the sovereign of Eḡlon. 
Josh
10:24  And it came to be, when they
brought out those sovereigns to Yehoshua, that Yehoshua called for all the men
of Yisra’ĕl, and said to the chiefs of the men of battle who went with
him, “Come near, put your feet on the necks of these sovereigns.” And they drew
near and put their feet on their necks. 
Josh
10:25  Then Yehoshua said to them, “Do
not be afraid nor be discouraged, be strong and courageous, for this is what יהוה
is going to do to all your enemies whom you are fighting.” 
Josh
10:26  And afterward Yehoshua smote them
and killed them, and hanged them on five trees. And they were hanging on the
trees until evening. 
Josh
10:27  And it came to be, at the time of
the going down of the sun, that Yehoshua commanded, and they took them down
from the trees, and threw them into the cave where they had been hidden, and
laid large stones against the cave’s mouth, to this day. 
Josh
10:28  And on that day Yehoshua captured
Maqqĕḏah, and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and he put its
sovereign under the ban – them and all the people who were in it, he left no
survivor. And he did to the sovereign of Maqqĕḏah as he had done to
the sovereign of Yeriḥo. 
Josh
10:29  Then Yehoshua passed over, and all
Yisra’ĕl with him, from Maqqĕḏah to Liḇnah. And they
fought against Liḇnah. 
Josh
10:30  And יהוה
also gave it and its sovereign into the hand of Yisra’ĕl. And he smote it
and all the people who were in it with the edge of the sword, he left no
survivor in it. And he did to its sovereign as he had done to the sovereign of
Yeriḥo. 
Josh
10:31  Then Yehoshua passed over, and all
Yisra’ĕl with him, from Liḇnah to Laḵish, and encamped against
it and fought against it. 
Josh
10:32  And יהוה
gave Laḵish into the hand of Yisra’ĕl, who captured it on the second
day, and smote it and all the people who were in it with the edge of the sword,
according to all that he had done to Liḇnah. 
Josh
10:33  Then Horam sovereign of Gezer came
up to help Laḵish. And Yehoshua smote him and his people, until he left
him no survivor. 
Josh
10:34  Then Yehoshua passed over, and all
Yisra’ĕl with him, from Laḵish to Eḡlon. And they encamped
against it and fought against it, 
Josh
10:35  and captured it on that day and
smote it with the edge of the sword. And all the beings who were in it he put
under the ban that day, according to all that he had done to Laḵish. 
Josh
10:36  Then Yehoshua went up, and all
Yisra’ĕl with him, from Eḡlon to Ḥeḇron, and they fought
against it, 
Josh
10:37  and captured it and smote it with
the edge of the sword, and its sovereign, and all its cities, and all the
people who were in it. He left no survivor, according to all that he had done
to Eḡlon, but put it and all the people who were in it under the ban.
Josh
10:38  Then Yehoshua returned, and all
Yisra’ĕl with him, to Deḇir, and fought against it, 
Josh
10:39  and captured it and its sovereign
and all its cities. And they smote them with the edge of the sword and put all
the people who were in it under the ban, he left no survivor. As he had done to
Ḥeḇron, so he did to Deḇir and its sovereign, as he had done
also to Liḇnah and its sovereign. 
Josh
10:40  Thus Yehoshua smote all the land:
the mountain country and the South and the low country and the wilderness
slopes, and all their sovereigns. He left no survivor, but put all that
breathed under the ban, as יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl
had commanded. 
Josh
10:41  And Yehoshua smote them from Qaḏĕsh
Barnĕa as far as Azzah, and all the land of Goshen, even as far as Giḇ‛on.

Josh
10:42  And Yehoshua captured all these
sovereigns and their land at one time, because יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl fought for Yisra’ĕl. 
Josh
10:43  And Yehoshua returned, and all
Yisra’ĕl with him, to the camp at Gilgal. 
Josh
11:1  And it came to be, when Yaḇin
sovereign of Ḥatsor heard, that he sent to Yoḇaḇ sovereign of
Maḏon, and to the sovereign of Shimron, and to the sovereign of Aḵshaph,

Josh
11:2  and to the sovereigns who were from
the north, in the mountains, and in the desert plain south of Kinneroth, and in
the low country, and in the heights of Dor on the west – 
Josh
11:3  the Kena‛anites in the east
and in the west, and the Amorite, and the Ḥittite, and the Perizzite, and
the Yeḇusite in the mountains, and the Ḥiwwite below Ḥermon
in the land of Mitspah. 
Josh
11:4  And they went out, they and all
their armies with them, as many people as numerous as the sand on the seashore,
with very many horses and chariots. 
Josh
11:5  And all these sovereigns met
together, and they came and camped together at the waters of Mĕrom to
fight against Yisra’ĕl. 
Josh
11:6  And יהוה
said to Yehoshua, “Do not be afraid of their presence, for tomorrow about this
time I am giving all of them over to Yisra’ĕl, slain. Hamstring their
horses and burn their chariots with fire.” 
Josh
11:7  And Yehoshua, and all the soldiers
with him, came against them suddenly by the waters of Mĕrom, and they fell
on them. 
Josh
11:8  And יהוה
gave them into the hand of Yisra’ĕl, and they smote them and pursued them
to Great Tsiḏon, and to Misrephoth Mayim, and to the Valley of Mitspeh
eastward. And they smote them until no survivor was left to them. 
Josh
11:9  And Yehoshua did to them as יהוה
said to him: he hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots with fire. 
Josh
11:10  And Yehoshua turned back at that
time and captured Ḥatsor, and smote its sovereign with the sword, for Ḥatsor
was formerly the head of all those reigns. 
Josh
11:11  And they smote all the people who
were in it with the edge of the sword, putting them under the ban. He did not
leave anyone breathing. Then he burned Ḥatsor with fire. 
Josh
11:12  And Yehoshua captured all the
cities of those sovereigns, and all their sovereigns, and he smote them with
the edge of the sword. He put them under the ban, as Mosheh the servant of יהוה
commanded. 
Josh
11:13  However, Yisra’ĕl did not
burn any cities that stood on their mounds, but Yehoshua burned only Ḥatsor.

Josh
11:14  And all the spoil of these cities
and the livestock, the children of Yisra’ĕl took as booty for themselves.
But they smote every man with the edge of the sword until they had destroyed
them, and they did not leave anyone breathing. 
Josh
11:15  As יהוה
had commanded Mosheh his servant, so Mosheh commanded Yehoshua, and so Yehoshua
did. He did not turn aside a word of all that יהוה had
commanded Mosheh. 
Josh
11:16  Thus Yehoshua took all this land:
the mountain country, and all the South, and all the land of Goshen, and the
low country, and the desert plain, and the mountains of Yisra’ĕl and its
low lands, 
Josh
11:17  from Mount Ḥalaq that goes
up to Sĕ‛ir, and as far as Ba‛al Gaḏ in the Valley of Leḇanon
below Mount Ḥermon. And he captured all their sovereigns, and smote them
and killed them. 
Josh
11:18  Yehoshua fought with all those
sovereigns for a long time. 
Josh
11:19  There was not a city that made
peace with the children of Yisra’ĕl, except the Ḥiwwites, the
inhabitants of Giḇ‛on. All the others they took in battle. 
Josh
11:20  For it was of יהוה
to harden their hearts, that they should come against Yisra’ĕl in battle,
in order to put them under the ban, so that they might have no favour, but that
He might annihilate them, as יהוה had commanded Mosheh.

Josh
11:21  And at that time Yehoshua came and
cut off the Anaqim from the mountains, from Ḥeḇron, from Deḇir,
from Anaḇ, and from all the mountains of Yehuḏah, and from all the
mountains of Yisra’ĕl. Yehoshua put them with their cities under the ban. 
Josh
11:22  There were none of the Anaqim left
in the land of the children of Yisra’ĕl; only in Azzah, in Gath, and in
Ashdoḏ some remained. 
Josh
11:23  Thus Yehoshua took the entire
land, according to all that יהוה had said to Mosheh.
And Yehoshua gave it as an inheritance to Yisra’ĕl according to their
divisions by their tribes. And the land rested from fighting. 
Josh
12:1  And these are the sovereigns of the
land whom the children of Yisra’ĕl smote, and whose land they possessed
beyond the Yardĕn towards the sun-rising, from the wadi Arnon to Mount Ḥermon,
and all the desert plain eastward: 
Josh
12:2  Siḥon sovereign of the
Amorites, who dwelt in Ḥeshbon, ruling from Aro‛ĕr, which is
on the bank of the wadi Arnon, from the middle of that wadi, and half Gil‛aḏ,
even as far as the wadi Yabboq, the border of the children of Ammon, 
Josh
12:3  and the desert plain from the Sea
of Kinneroth eastward as far as the Sea of the Araḇah, the Salt Sea, the
way to Bĕyth Yeshimoth, and southward below the slopes of Pisgah, 
Josh
12:4  and the border of Oḡ,
sovereign of Bashan, who was of the remnant of the Repha’ites, who dwelt at
Ashtaroth and at Eḏre‛i, 
Josh
12:5  and ruled in Mount Ḥermon,
and in Salḵah, and in all Bashan, as far as the border of the Geshurites
and the Ma‛aḵathites, and the half of Gil‛aḏ as far as
the border of Siḥon sovereign of Ḥeshbon. 
Josh
12:6  Mosheh the servant of יהוה
and the children of Yisra’ĕl had smitten them. And Mosheh the servant of יהוה
had given it as a possession to the Re’uḇĕnites, and to the Gaḏites,
and to half the tribe of Menashsheh. 
Josh
12:7  And these are the sovereigns of the
land which Yehoshua and the children of Yisra’ĕl smote beyond the Yardĕn,
on the west, from Ba‛al Gaḏ in the Valley of Leḇanon as far
as Mount Ḥalaq that goes up to Sĕ‛ir, which Yehoshua gave to
the tribes of Yisra’ĕl as a possession according to their divisions, 
Josh
12:8  in the mountain country, and in the
low country, and in the desert plain, and in the slopes, and in the wilderness,
and in the South, the Ḥittites, the Amorites and the Kena‛anites,
the Perizzites, the Ḥiwwites, and the Yeḇusites: 
Josh
12:9  the sovereign of Yeriḥo, one;
the sovereign of Ai, which is beside Bĕyth Ĕl, one; 
Josh
12:10  the sovereign of Yerushalayim,
one; the sovereign of Ḥeḇron, one; 
Josh
12:11  the sovereign of Yarmuth, one; the
sovereign of Laḵish, one; 
Josh
12:12  the sovereign of Eḡlon, one;
the sovereign of Gezer, one; 
Josh
12:13  the sovereign of Deḇir, one;
the sovereign of Geḏer, one; 
Josh
12:14  the sovereign of Ḥormah,
one; the sovereign of Araḏ, one; 
Josh
12:15  the sovereign of Liḇnah,
one; the sovereign of Aḏullam, one; 
Josh
12:16  the sovereign of Maqqĕḏah,
one; the sovereign of Bĕyth Ĕl, one; 
Josh
12:17  the sovereign of Tappuwaḥ,
one; the sovereign of Ḥĕpher, one; 
Josh
12:18  the sovereign of Aphĕq, one;
the sovereign of Sharon, one; 
Josh
12:19  the sovereign of Maḏon, one;
the sovereign of Ḥatsor, one; 
Josh
12:20  the sovereign of Shimron Mĕron,
one; the sovereign of Aḵshaph, one; 
Josh
12:21  the sovereign of Ta‛anaḵ,
one; the sovereign of Meḡiddo, one; 
Josh
12:22  the sovereign of Qeḏesh,
one; the sovereign of Yoqne‛am in Karmel, one; 
Josh
12:23  the sovereign of Dor in the
heights of Dor, one; the sovereign of the nations of Gilgal, one; 
Josh
12:24  the sovereign of Tirtsah, one –
thirty-one sovereigns in all. 
Josh
13:1  And Yehoshua was old, advanced in
years. And יהוה said to him, “You are old, advanced in
years, and still much of the land remains to be possessed. 
Josh
13:2  “This is the land that remains: all
the districts of the Philistines and all the Geshurites, 
Josh
13:3  from Shiḥor which is in front
of Mitsrayim, and up to the border of Eqron northward, are considered as Kena‛anite
– the five princes of the Philistines, the Azzathites, and the Ashdoḏites,
the Eshqelonites, the Gittites, and the Eqronites; also the Awwites 
Josh
13:4  on the south; all the land of the
Kena‛anites, and Me‛arah that belongs to the Tsiḏonians as
far as Aphĕq, to the border of the Amorites; 
Josh
13:5  and the land of the Geḇalites,
and all Leḇanon, toward the sunrise, from Ba‛al Gaḏ below
Mount Ḥermon as far as the entrance to Ḥamath; 
Josh
13:6  all the inhabitants of the
mountains from Leḇanon as far as Misrephoth Mayim, and all the Tsiḏonians.
I Myself drive them out from before the children of Yisra’ĕl. Only, divide
it by lot to Yisra’ĕl as an inheritance, as I have commanded you. 
Josh
13:7  “And now, divide this land as an
inheritance to the nine tribes and half the tribe of Menashsheh.” 
Josh
13:8  With them the other half tribe the
Re’uḇĕnites and the Gaḏites received their inheritance, which
Mosheh had given them, beyond the Yardĕn eastward, as Mosheh the servant
of יהוה had given them: 
Josh
13:9  from Aro‛ĕr which is on
the bank of the wadi Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the wadi, and
all the plain of Mĕyḏeḇa as far as Diḇon;
Josh
13:10  and all the cities of Siḥon
sovereign of the Amorites, who reigned in Ḥeshbon, as far as the border
of the children of Ammon; 
Josh
13:11  and Gil‛aḏ, and the
border of the Geshurites, and of the Ma‛aḵathites, and all Mount Ḥermon,
and all Bashan as far as Salḵah; 
Josh
13:12  all the reign of Oḡ in
Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and Eḏre‛i, who remained of the
remnant of the Repha’ites, for Mosheh had smitten and dispossessed them. 
Josh
13:13  However, the children of Yisra’ĕl
did not drive out the Geshurites nor the Ma‛aḵathites, so the
Geshurites and the Ma‛aḵathites dwell in the midst of Yisra’ĕl
to this day. 
Josh
13:14  Only to the tribe of Lĕwi he
had given no inheritance – the offerings made by fire to יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl were their inheritance, as He said to them. 
Josh
13:15  And Mosheh gave to the tribe of
the children of Re’uḇĕn, for their clans: 
Josh
13:16  and their border was from Aro‛ĕr,
which is on the bank of the wadi Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of
the wadi, and all the plain by Mĕyḏeḇa, 
Josh
13:17  Ḥeshbon and all its cities
that are in the plain: Diḇon, and Bamoth Ba‛al, and Bĕyth Ba‛al
Me‛on, 
Josh
13:18  and Yahtsah, and Qeḏĕmoth,
and Mĕpha‛ath, 
Josh
13:19  and Qiryathayim, and Siḇmah,
and Tsereth Shaḥar on the mountain of the valley, 
Josh
13:20  and Bĕyth Pe‛or, and
the slopes of Pisgah, and Bĕyth Yeshimoth; 
Josh
13:21  and all the cities of the
tableland, and all the reign of Siḥon sovereign of the Amorites, who
reigned in Ḥeshbon, whom Mosheh had smitten with the princes of Miḏyan:
Ewi, and Reqem, and Tsur, and Ḥur, and Reḇa, princes of Siḥon
dwelling in the land. 
Josh
13:22  And the sons of Yisra’ĕl
killed with the sword Bil‛am son of Be‛or, the diviner, among those
who were killed by them. 
Josh
13:23  And the border of the children of
Re’uḇĕn was the bank of the Yardĕn. This was the inheritance of
the children of Re’uḇĕn for their clans, the cities and their
villages. 
Josh
13:24  And Mosheh gave to the tribe of Gaḏ,
to the children of Gaḏ for their clans: 
Josh
13:25  and their border was Ya‛zĕr,
and all the cities of Gil‛aḏ, and half the land of the children of
Ammon as far as Aro‛ĕr, which is before Rabbah, 
Josh
13:26  and from Ḥeshbon to Ramath
Mitspeh and Betonim, and from Maḥanayim to the border of Deḇir, 
Josh
13:27  and in the valley Bĕyth
Haram, and Bĕyth Nimrah, and Sukkoth, and Tsaphon, the rest of the reign
of Siḥon sovereign of Ḥeshbon, the Yardĕn being its border, as
far as the edge of the Sea of Kinnereth, beyond the Yardĕn eastward. 
Josh
13:28  This is the inheritance of the children
of Gaḏ for their clans, the cities and their villages. 
Josh
13:29  And Mosheh gave to half the tribe
of Menashsheh, and it was for half the tribe of the children of Menashsheh for
their clans: 
Josh
13:30  and their border was from
Maḥanayim, all Bashan, all the reign of Oḡ sovereign of Bashan, and
all the small towns of Ya’ir which are in Bashan, sixty cities; 
Josh
13:31  and the half of Gil‛aḏ,
and Ashtaroth and Eḏre‛i, cities of the reign of Oḡ in
Bashan, were for the children of Maḵir son of Menashsheh, to the half of
the children of Maḵir for their clans. 
Josh
13:32  These Mosheh gave as an
inheritance in the desert plains of Mo’aḇ beyond the Yardĕn, by
Yeriḥo eastward. 
Josh
13:33  But to the tribe of Lĕwi
Mosheh gave no inheritance. יהוה, Elohim of Yisra’ĕl,
He was their inheritance, as He had said to them. 
Josh
14:1  Now these the children of Yisra’ĕl
inherited in the land of Kena‛an, which El‛azar the priest, and
Yehoshua son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children
of Yisra’ĕl caused them to inherit. 
Josh
14:2  Their inheritance was by lot, as יהוה
had commanded by the hand of Mosheh, for the nine tribes and the half-tribe. 
Josh
14:3  For Mosheh had given the
inheritance of the two tribes and the half-tribe beyond the Yardĕn, but to
the Lĕwites he gave no inheritance in their midst. 
Josh
14:4  For the children of Yosĕph had
become two tribes: Menashsheh and Ephrayim. And they gave no part to the Lĕwites
in the land, except cities to dwell in, with their open land for their
livestock and their possessions. 
Josh
14:5  As יהוה had
commanded Mosheh, so the children of Yisra’ĕl did, and they divided the
land. 
Josh
14:6  And the children of Yehuḏah
came to Yehoshua in Gilgal, and Kalĕḇ son of Yephunneh the Kenizzite
said to him, “You know the word which יהוה said to
Mosheh the man of Elohim concerning you and me in Qaḏĕsh Barnĕa.

Josh
14:7  “I was forty years old when Mosheh
the servant of יהוה sent me from Qaḏĕsh Barnĕa
to spy out the land, and I brought back word to him as it was in my heart. 
Josh
14:8  “But my brothers who went up with
me made the heart of the people melt, but I followed יהוה
my Elohim completely. 
Josh
14:9  “So Mosheh swore on that day,
saying, ‘The land on which your foot has trodden is your inheritance and your
children’s forever, because you have followed יהוה my
Elohim completely.’ 
Josh
14:10  “And now, see, יהוה
has kept me alive, as He said, these forty-five years since יהוה
spoke this word to Mosheh while Yisra’ĕl walked in the wilderness. And
now, see, I am eighty-five years old today. 
Josh
14:11  “Yet I am still as strong today as
I was on the day that Mosheh sent me. As my strength was then, so my strength
is now, for battle, and for going out and for coming in. 
Josh
14:12  “And now, give me this mountain of
which יהוה spoke in that day, for you heard in that day
how the Anaqim were there, and that the cities were great and walled. If יהוה
is with me, then I shall dispossess them, as יהוה said.”

Josh
14:13  Yehoshua then blessed him, and
gave Ḥeḇron to Kalĕḇ son of Yephunneh as an inheritance.

Josh
14:14  So Ḥeḇron became the
inheritance of Kalĕḇ son of Yephunneh the Qenizzite to this day,
because he followed יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl
completely. 
Josh
14:15  Now the name of Ḥeḇron
was formerly Qiryath Arba (Arba was
the greatest man among the Anaqim). And the land had rest from fighting. 
Josh
15:1  And the lot of the tribe of the
children of Yehuḏah for their clans was to the border of Eḏom, the
Wilderness of Tsin southward in the extreme south. 
Josh
15:2  And their southern border began at
the edge of the Salt Sea, from the bay that faces southward. 
Josh
15:3  And it went out to the southern
side of the Ascent of Aqrabbim, passed over to Tsin, and went up on the south
side of Qaḏĕsh Barnĕa, and passed over to Ḥetsron, went
up to Aḏar, and went around to Qarqa, 
Josh
15:4  and passed over to Atsmon, and went
out to the wadi of Mitsrayim, and the border ended at the sea. This is your
southern border. 
Josh
15:5  And the east border was the Salt
Sea as far as the end of the Yardĕn. And the border on the northern
quarter began at the bay of the sea at the end of the Yardĕn. 
Josh
15:6  And the border went up to Bĕyth
Ḥoḡlah and passed over north of Bĕyth Araḇah. And the
border went up to the stone of Bohan son of Re’uḇĕn. 
Josh
15:7  And the border went up toward Deḇir
from the Valley of Aḵor, and it turned northward toward Gilgal, which is
before the Ascent of Aḏummim, which is south of the wadi. And the border
passed over to the waters of Ĕn Shemesh and ended at Ĕn Roḡĕl.

Josh
15:8  And the border went up by the
Valley of the Son of Hinnom to the southern slope of the Yeḇusite city,
that is Yerushalayim. And the border went up to the top of the mountain that
lies before the Valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the end of the Valley of
Repha’im northward. 
Josh
15:9  And the border went around from the
top of the hill to the fountain of the water of Nephtowaḥ, and went up to
the cities of Mount Ephron. And the border went around to Ba‛alah, that
is Qiryath Ye‛arim. 
Josh
15:10  And the border turned around from
Ba‛alah westward to Mount Sĕ‛ir, and passed over to the side
of Mount Ye‛arim on the north, that is Kesalon, and went down to Bĕyth
Shemesh, and passed over to Timnah. 
Josh
15:11  And the border went out to the
side of Eqron northward. And the border went around to Shikkeron, and passed
over to Mount Ba‛alah, and went out to Yaḇne’ĕl. And the
border ended at the sea. 
Josh
15:12  And the west border was the
coastline of the Great Sea. This is the boundary of the children of Yehuḏah
all around for their clans. 
Josh
15:13  And to Kalĕḇ son of
Yephunneh he gave a portion in the midst of the children of Yehuḏah,
according to the command of יהוה to Yehoshua: Qiryath
Arba, that is Ḥeḇron – Arba
was the father of Anaq. 
Josh
15:14  And Kalĕḇ drove out the
three sons of Anaq from there: Shĕshai, and Aḥiman, and Talmai, the
children of Anaq. 
Josh
15:15  And he went up from there to the
inhabitants of Deḇir, and the name of Deḇir formerly was Qiryath Sĕpher.

Josh
15:16  And Kalĕḇ said, “He who
smites Qiryath Sĕpher and shall capture it, to him I shall give Aḵsah
my daughter as wife.” 
Josh
15:17  And Othni’ĕl son of Qenaz,
the brother of Kalĕḇ, did capture it, so he gave him Aḵsah his
daughter as wife. 
Josh
15:18  And it came to be, when she came
to him, that she persuaded him to ask her father for a field. And when she got
off from the donkey, Kalĕḇ said to her, “What is the matter?” 
Josh
15:19  And she said, “Give me a blessing.
Since you have given me land in the South, give me also fountains of water.”
And he gave her the upper fountains and the lower fountains. 
Josh
15:20  This was the inheritance of the
tribe of the children of Yehuḏah for their clans: 
Josh
15:21  And the cities at the furthest
border of the tribe of the children of Yehuḏah, toward the border of Eḏom
in the South, were Qaḇtse’ĕl, and Ĕḏer, and Yaḡur, 
Josh
15:22  and Qinah, and Dimonah, and Aḏaḏah,

Josh
15:23  and Qeḏesh, and Ḥatsor,
and Yithnan, 
Josh
15:24  Ziph, and Telem, and Be‛aloth,

Josh
15:25  and Ḥatsor, Ḥaḏattah,
and Qeriyoth, Ḥetsron, that is Ḥatsor, 
Josh
15:26  Amam, and Shema, and Molaḏah,

Josh
15:27  and Ḥatsar Gaddah, and Ḥeshmon,
and Bĕyth Pelet, 
Josh
15:28  and Ḥatsar Shu‛al, and
Be’ĕrsheḇa, and Bizyothyah, 
Josh
15:29  Ba‛alah, and Iyim, and
Etsem, 
Josh
15:30  and Eltolaḏ, and Kesil, and Ḥormah,

Josh
15:31  and Tsiqlaḡ, and Maḏmannah,
and Sansannah, 
Josh
15:32  and Leḇa’oth, and
Shilḥim, and Ayin, and Rimmon. All the cities were twenty-nine, with
their villages. 
Josh
15:33  In the low country: Eshta’ol, and
Tsor‛ah, and Ashnah, 
Josh
15:34  and Zanowaḥ, and Ĕn
Gannim, Tappuwaḥ and Ĕnam, 
Josh
15:35  Yarmuth and Aḏullam, Soḵoh
and Azĕqah, 
Josh
15:36  and Sha‛arayim, and Aḏithayim,
and Geḏĕrah, and Geḏĕrothayim – fourteen cities with
their villages. 
Josh
15:37  Tsenan, and Ḥaḏashah,
and Miḡdal Gaḏ, 
Josh
15:38  and Dil‛an, and Mitspeh, and
Yoqthe’ĕl, 
Josh
15:39  Laḵish, and Botsqath, and Eḡlon,

Josh
15:40  and Kabbon, and Laḥmam, and
Kithlish, 
Josh
15:41  and Geḏĕroth, Bĕyth
Daḡon, and Na‛amah, and Maqqĕḏah – sixteen cities with
their villages. 
Josh
15:42  Liḇnah, and Ether, and
Ashan, 
Josh
15:43  and Yiphtaḥ, and Ashnah, and
Netsiḇ, 
Josh
15:44  and Qe‛ilah, and Aḵziḇ,
and Marĕshah – nine cities with their villages. 
Josh
15:45  Eqron with its towns and its
villages, 
Josh
15:46  from Eqron to the sea, all that
were by the side of Ashdoḏ, with their villages. 
Josh
15:47  Ashdoḏ, its towns and its
villages; Azzah, its towns and its villages; as far as the wadi of Mitsrayim
and the Great Sea with its coastline. 
Josh
15:48  And in the mountain country:
Shamur, and Yattir, and Soḵoh, 
Josh
15:49  and Dannah, and Qiryath Sannah,
that is Deḇir, 
Josh
15:50  and Anaḇ, and Eshtemoh, and

Josh
15:51  and Goshen, and Ḥolon, and
Giloh – eleven cities with their villages. 
Josh
15:52  Araḇ, and Dumah, and Esh‛an,

Josh
15:53  and Yanim, and Bĕyth
Tappuwaḥ, and Aphĕqah, 
Josh
15:54  and Ḥumtah, and Qiryath
Arba, that is Ḥeḇron, and Tsi‛or – nine cities with their
villages. 
Josh
15:55  Ma‛on, Karmel, and Ziph, and

Josh
15:56  and Yizre‛ĕl, and Yoqḏe‛am,
and Zanowaḥ, 
Josh
15:57  Qayin, Giḇ‛ah, and
Timnah – ten cities with their villages. 
Josh
15:58  Ḥalḥul, Bĕyth
Tsur, and Geḏor, 
Josh
15:59  and Ma‛arath, and Bĕyth
Anoth, and Elteqon – six cities with their villages. 
Josh
15:60  Qiryath Ba‛al, that is
Qiryath Ye‛arim, and Rabbah – two cities with their villages. 
Josh
15:61  In the wilderness: Bĕyth Araḇah,
Middin, and Seḵaḵah, 
Josh
15:62  and Niḇshan, and the City of
Salt, and Ĕn Geḏi – six cities with their villages. 
Josh
15:63  As for the Yeḇusites, the
inhabitants of Yerushalayim, the children of Yehuḏah were unable to drive
them out, so the Yeḇusites have dwelt with the children of Yehuḏah
at Yerushalayim to this day.
Josh
16:1  And the lot for the children of Yosĕph
went out from the Yardĕn, by Yeriḥo, to the waters of Yeriḥo
on the east, to the wilderness going up from Yeriḥo through the mountains
to Bĕyth Ĕl, 
Josh
16:2  and went out from Bĕyth Ĕl
to Luz, and passed over to the border of the Arkites at Ataroth, 
Josh
16:3  and went down westward to the
boundary of the Yaphlĕtites, as far as the boundary of Lower Bĕyth Ḥoron
to Gezer, and it ended at the sea. 
Josh
16:4  Thus the children of Yosĕph,
Menashsheh and Ephrayim, inherited. 
Josh
16:5  And the border of the children of
Ephrayim, according to their clans, was: The border of their inheritance on the
east side was Ataroth Addar as far as Upper Bĕyth Ḥoron. 
Josh
16:6  And the border went out toward the
sea, to Miḵmethath on the north, then the border went around eastward to
Ta’anath Shiloh, and passed over it on the east of Yanoḥah,
Josh
16:7  and went down from Yanoḥah to
Ataroth and Na‛arah, reached to Yeriḥo, and came out at the Yardĕn.

Josh
16:8  From Tappuwaḥ the border went
westward to the wadi Qanah, and it ended at the sea. This was the inheritance
of the tribe of the children of Ephrayim for their clans. 
Josh
16:9  And the separate cities for the
children of Ephrayim were in the midst of the inheritance of the children of
Menashsheh, all the cities with their villages. 
Josh
16:10  And they did not drive out the
Kena‛anites who dwelt in Gezer, so the Kena‛anites dwell among the
Ephrayimites to this day and have become compulsory labour. 
Josh
17:1  And the lot for the tribe of
Menashsheh, for he was the first-born of Yosĕph, was: for Maḵir the
first-born of Menashsheh, father of Gil‛aḏ, because he was a man of
battle, therefore he had Gil‛aḏ and Bashan.
Josh
17:2  And for the rest of the children of
Menashsheh for their clans there was: for the children of Aḇi‛ezer,
and for the children of Ḥĕleq, and for the children of Asri’ĕl,
and for the children of Sheḵem, and for the children of Ḥĕpher,
and for the children of Shemiḏa. These were the male children of
Menashsheh son of Yosĕph according to their clans. 
Josh
17:3  But Tselophḥaḏ son of Ḥĕpher,
son of Gil‛aḏ, son of Maḵir, son of Menashsheh, had no sons,
but only daughters. And these were the names of his daughters: Maḥlah and
No‛ah, Ḥoḡlah, Milkah and Tirtsah. 
Josh
17:4  And they came near before El‛azar
the priest, before Yehoshua son of Nun, and before the rulers, saying, “ יהוה
commanded Mosheh to give us an inheritance among our brothers.” So he gave them
an inheritance among their father’s brothers, according to the command of יהוה.

Josh
17:5  And ten portions fell to
Menashsheh, besides the land of Gil‛aḏ and Bashan, which were
beyond the Yardĕn, 
Josh
17:6  because the daughters of Menashsheh
received an inheritance among his sons. And the rest of Menashsheh’s sons had
the land of Gil‛aḏ. 
Josh
17:7  And the border of Menashsheh was
from Ashĕr to Miḵmethath, which faces Sheḵem. And the border
went up to the right to the inhabitants of Ĕn Tappuwaḥ. 
Josh
17:8  The land of Tappuwaḥ belonged
to Menashsheh, but Tappuwaḥ on the border of Menashsheh belonged to the
children of Ephrayim. 
Josh
17:9  And the border went down to the
wadi Qanah, southward to the wadi. These cities of Ephrayim were in the midst
of the cities of Menashsheh, but the border of Menashsheh was north of the
wadi, and it ended at the sea. 
Josh
17:10  Southward it was Ephrayim’s, and
northward it was Menashsheh’s, and the sea was its border, and they reached to
Ashĕr on the north and to Yissasḵar on the east. 
Josh
17:11  And in Yissasḵar and in Ashĕr,
Menashsheh had Bĕyth She’an and its towns, and Yiḇle‛am and
its towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of Ĕn
Dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of Ta‛anaḵ and its towns,
and the inhabitants of Meḡiddo and its towns – three of the heights. 
Josh
17:12  But the children of Menashsheh
were unable to drive out the inhabitants of those cities, for the Kena‛anites
desired to dwell in that land. 
Josh
17:13  And it came to be, when the
children of Yisra’ĕl were strong, that they put the Kena‛anites to
compulsory labour, but did not utterly drive them out. 
Josh
17:14  And the children of Yosĕph
spoke to Yehoshua, saying, “Why have you given us but one lot and one portion
to inherit, seeing we are a great people whom יהוה has
blessed until now?” 
Josh
17:15  And Yehoshua said to them, “If you
are a great people, go up to the forest and clear a place for yourself there in
the land of the Perizzites and the Repha’ites, since the hill country of
Ephrayim is too narrow for you.” 
Josh
17:16  Then the children of Yosĕph
said, “The hill country is not enough for us, and all the Kena‛anites who
dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, both those who are of Bĕyth
She’an and its towns and those who are of the Valley of Yizre‛ĕl.” 
Josh
17:17  And Yehoshua spoke to the house of
Yosĕph, to Ephrayim and to Menashsheh, saying, “You are a great people and
have great power, you are not to have one lot, 
Josh
17:18  for the hill country shall be
yours. For though it is a forest, you shall cut it down, and its farthest
limits shall be yours. For you are to drive out the Kena‛anites, though
they have iron chariots and are strong.” 
Josh
18:1  And all the congregation of the
children of Yisra’ĕl assembled at Shiloh, and they let the Tent of Meeting
dwell there. And the land was subdued before them. 
Josh
18:2  And seven tribes were left among
the children of Yisra’ĕl who had not yet shared their inheritance. 
Josh
18:3  So Yehoshua said to the children of
Yisra’ĕl, “Till when are you going to fail to go in and possess the land
which יהוה Elohim of your fathers has given you? 
Josh
18:4  “Appoint three men from each tribe,
and let me send them out to go through the land and describe it according to
their inheritance, and come back to me. 
Josh
18:5  “And they shall divide it into
seven portions – Yehuḏah stays within their border on the south, and the
house of Yosĕph stays within their border on the north – 
Josh
18:6  and you shall describe the land in
seven portions, and shall bring it to me. Then I shall cast lots for you here
before יהוה our Elohim. 
Josh
18:7  “But the Lĕwites have no
portion among you, for the priesthood of יהוה is their
inheritance. And Gaḏ, and Re’uḇĕn, and half the tribe of
Menashsheh have received their inheritance beyond the Yardĕn on the east,
which Mosheh the servant of יהוה gave them.” 
Josh
18:8  So the men rose up and went. And
Yehoshua commanded those who went to describe the land, saying, “Go, walk
through the land, and describe it, and come back to me, and let me cast lots
for you here before יהוה in Shiloh.” 
Josh
18:9  So the men went, and passed through
the land, and described it in a book in seven portions by cities. And they came
to Yehoshua at the camp in Shiloh. 
Josh
18:10  And Yehoshua cast lots for them in
Shiloh before יהוה, and there Yehoshua divided the land
to the children of Yisra’ĕl according to their portions. 
Josh
18:11  And the lot of the tribe of the
children of Binyamin came up for their clans, and the border of their lot came
out between the children of Yehuḏah and the children of Yosĕph. 
Josh
18:12  And their border was on the north
side from the Yardĕn, and the border went up to the side of Yeriḥo
on the north, and went up through the mountains westward, and ended at the
Wilderness of Bĕyth Awen. 
Josh
18:13  And the border went over from
there toward Luz, to the side of Luz, that is Bĕyth Ĕl, southward.
And the border went down to Ataroth Aḏar, by the hill that lies on the
south side of Lower Bĕyth Ḥoron. 
Josh
18:14  And the border was drawn and went
around the west side to the south, from the hill that faces Bĕyth Ḥoron
southward, and it ended at Qiryath Ba‛al, that is Qiryath Ye‛arim,
a city of the children of Yehuḏah. This was the west side. 
Josh
18:15  And the south side was from the
end of Qiryath Ye‛arim, and the border went out westward, and went out to
the fountain of the waters of Nephtowaḥ. 
Josh
18:16  And the border came down to the
end of the mountain that faces the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, which is in the
Valley of the Repha’im on the north, and went down to the Valley of Hinnom, to
the side of the Yeḇusite city on the south, and went down to Ĕn Roḡĕl.

Josh
18:17  And it was drawn from the north,
went out to Ĕn Shemesh, and went out toward Geliloth, which is opposite
the Ascent of Aḏummim, and went down to the stone of Bohan son of Re’uḇĕn,

Josh
18:18  and passed over to the side
opposite Araḇah northward, and went down to Araḇah. 
Josh
18:19  And the border passed over to the
side of Bĕyth Ḥoḡlah northward, and the border ended at the
north bay at the Salt Sea, at the south end of the Yardĕn. This was the
southern boundary, 
Josh
18:20  and the Yardĕn borders it on
the east side. This was the inheritance of the children of Binyamin, according
to its boundaries all around, for their clans. 
Josh
18:21  And the cities for the tribe of
the children of Binyamin, for their clans, were Yeriḥo, and Bĕyth Ḥoḡlah,
and Ĕmeq Qetsits, 
Josh
18:22  and Bĕyth Araḇah, and
Tsemarayim, and Bĕyth Ĕl, 
Josh
18:23  and Awwim, and Parah, and Ophrah,

18:24  and Kephar Ha‛ammoni, and
Ophni, and Gaḇa – twelve cities with their villages.

18:26  and Mitspeh, and Kephirah, and
Motsah, 
Josh
18:27  and Reqem, and Yirpe’ĕl, and
Taralah, 
Josh
18:28  and Tsela, Eleph, and the Yeḇusite,
that is Yerushalayim, Giḇ‛ath, and Qiryath – fourteen cities with
their villages. This was the inheritance of the children of Binyamin for their
clans. 
Josh
19:1  And the second lot came out for
Shim‛on, for the tribe of the children of Shim‛on for their clans.
And their inheritance was within the inheritance of the children of Yehuḏah.

Josh
19:2  And they had in their inheritance
Be’ĕrsheḇa, or Sheḇa, and Molaḏah, 
Josh
19:3  and Ḥatsar Shu‛al, and
Balah, and Etsem, 
Josh
19:4  and Eltolaḏ, and Bethul, and Ḥormah,

Josh
19:5  and Tsiqlaḡ, and Bĕyth
Markaḇoth, and Ḥatsar Susah, 
Josh
19:6  and Bĕyth Leḇa’oth, and
Sharuḥen – thirteen cities and their villages. 
Josh
19:7  Ayin, Rimmon, and Ether, and Ashan –
four cities and their villages; 
Josh
19:8  and all the villages that were all
around these cities as far as Ba‛alath Be’ĕr, Ramath Neḡeḇ.
This was the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Shim‛on for
their clans. 
Josh
19:9  The inheritance of the children of
Shim‛on was out of the portion of the children of Yehuḏah, for the
portion of the children of Yehuḏah was too much for them. So the children
of Shim‛on had their inheritance within their inheritance. 
Josh
19:10  And the third lot came up for the
children of Zeḇulun for their clans, and the border of their inheritance
was as far as Sariḏ. 
Josh
19:11  And their border went toward the
sea, and Maralah, and reached to Dabbesheth, and reached to the wadi that faced
Yoqne‛am, 
Josh
19:12  and turned back from Sariḏ
eastward toward the sunrise, to the border of Kisloth Taḇor, and went out
toward Daḇerath, and went up to Yaphiya. 
Josh
19:13  And from there it passed over
eastward, to the east of Gath Ḥĕpher, toward Eth Qatsin, and went
out to Rimmon, which borders on Nĕ‛ah. 
Josh
19:14  And the border went around it on
the north side of Ḥannathon, and it ended in the Valley of Yiphthaḥ
Ĕl; 
Josh
19:15  also Qattath, and Nahalal, and
Shimron, and Yiḏalah, and Bĕyth Leḥem – twelve cities with
their villages. 
Josh
19:16  This was the inheritance of the
children of Zeḇulun for their clans, these cities with their villages. 
Josh
19:17  The fourth lot came out to Yissasḵar,

19:22  And the border reached to Taḇor,
and Shaḥatsimah, and Bĕyth Shemesh, and their border ended at the
Yardĕn – sixteen cities with their villages. 
Josh
19:23  This was the inheritance of the
tribe of the children of Yissasḵar for their clans, the cities and their
villages. 
Josh
19:24  And the fifth lot came out for the

19:27  and turned toward the sunrise, to
Bĕyth Daḡon, and reached to Zeḇulun and to the Valley of
Yiphthaḥ Ĕl, then northward beyond Bĕyth Ĕmeq and Ne‛i’ĕl,
and went out to Kaḇul which was on the left, 
Josh
19:28  and Ḥeḇron, and
Reḥoḇ, and Ḥammon, and Qanah, as far as Great Tsiḏon. 
Josh
19:29  And the border turned to Ramah and
to the strong city Tsor, and the border turned to Ḥosah, and ended at the
sea, from the coast to Aḵziḇ. 
Josh
19:30  And Ummah, and Aphĕq, and

Josh
19:31  This was the inheritance of the

tribe of the children of Naphtali for their clans, the cities with their
villages. 
Josh
19:40  The seventh lot came out for the

Josh
19:47  And the border of the children of
Dan went out from them. And the children of Dan went up to fight against Leshem
and captured it. And they smote it with the edge of the sword, and possessed
it, and dwelt in it, and called it Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan their
father. 
Josh
19:48  This is the inheritance of the
tribe of the children of Dan for their clans, these cities with their villages.

Josh
19:49  And when they had ended dividing
the land as an inheritance according to their borders, the children of Yisra’ĕl
gave an inheritance to Yehoshua son of Nun in their midst. 
Josh
19:50  According to the mouth of יהוה
they gave him the city which he asked for, Timnath Seraḥ in the mountains
of Ephrayim. And he built the city and dwelt in it. 
Josh
19:51  These were the inheritances which
El‛azar the priest, and Yehoshua son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers
of the tribes of the children of Yisra’ĕl divided as an inheritance by lot
in Shiloh before יהוה, at the door of the Tent of
Meeting. And they ended dividing the country. 
Josh
20:1  And יהוה
spoke to Yehoshua, saying, 
Josh
20:2  “Speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl,
saying, ‘Appoint for yourselves cities of refuge, of which I spoke to you
through Mosheh, 
Josh
20:3  for the slayer who kills any being
accidentally, unintentionally, to flee there. And they shall be your refuge
from the revenger of blood. 
Josh
20:4  ‘And he shall flee to one of those
cities, and stand at the entrance of the gate of the city, and declare his case
in the hearing of the elders of that city. And they shall take him into the
city as one of them, and give him a place, and he shall dwell among them. 
Josh
20:5  ‘And when the revenger of blood
pursues him, they do not give the slayer into his hand, because he smote his
neighbour unintentionally, and did not hate him beforehand. 
Josh
20:6  ‘And he shall dwell in that city
until he stands before the congregation for right-ruling, and until the death
of the one who is high priest in those days. Then let the slayer return and
come to his own city and his own house, to the city from which he fled.’ ” 
Josh
20:7  So they set apart Qeḏesh in
Galil, in the mountains of Naphtali, and Sheḵem in the mountains of
Ephrayim, and Qiryath Arba, that is Ḥeḇron, in the mountains of
Yehuḏah. 
Josh
20:8  And beyond the Yardĕn, by
Yeriḥo eastward, they appointed Betser in the wilderness on the plain,
from the tribe of Re’uḇĕn, and Ramoth in Gil‛aḏ, from
the tribe of Gaḏ, and Golan in Bashan, from the tribe of Menashsheh. 
Josh
20:9  These were the cities appointed for
all the children of Yisra’ĕl and for the stranger who sojourned in their
midst, for anyone accidentally killing any being, to flee there, and not die by
the hand of the revenger of blood until he stood before the congregation. 
Josh
21:1  And the heads of the fathers of the
Lĕwites came near to El‛azar the priest, to Yehoshua son of Nun, and
to the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Yisra’ĕl. 
Josh
21:2  And they spoke to them at Shiloh in
the land of Kena‛an, saying, “ יהוה commanded
through Mosheh to give us cities to dwell in, with their open land for our
livestock.” 
Josh
21:3  So the children of Yisra’ĕl
gave to the Lĕwites from their inheritance, at the command of יהוה,
these cities and their open land: 
Josh
21:4  And the lot came out for the clans
of the Qehathites. And the children of Aharon the priest, who were of the Lĕwites,
had thirteen cities by lot from the tribe of Yehuḏah, from the tribe of
Shim‛on, and from the tribe of Binyamin. 
Josh
21:5  And the rest of the children of
Qehath had ten cities by lot from the clans of the tribe of Ephrayim, from the
tribe of Dan, and from the half-tribe of Menashsheh. 
Josh
21:6  And the children of Gĕrshon
had thirteen cities by lot from the clans of the tribe of Yissasḵar, from
the tribe of Ashĕr, from the tribe of Naphtali, and from the half-tribe of
Menashsheh in Bashan. 
Josh
21:7  The children of Merari for their
clans had twelve cities from the tribe of Re’uḇĕn, and from the tribe
of Gaḏ, and from the tribe of Zeḇulun. 
Josh
21:8  Thus the children of Yisra’ĕl
gave these cities with their open land by lot to the Lĕwites, as יהוה
had commanded by the hand of Mosheh. 
Josh
21:9  So from the tribe of the children
of Yehuḏah and from the tribe of the children of Shim‛on they gave
these cities which are mentioned by name, 
Josh
21:10  and they were for the children of
Aharon, one of the clans of the Qehathites, who were of the children of Lĕwi,
for the lot was theirs first. 
Josh
21:11  And they gave them Qiryath Arba,
that is Ḥeḇron – Arba was
the father of Anaq – in the mountains of Yehuḏah, with the open land
surrounding it. 
Josh
21:12  And the fields of the city and its
villages they gave to Kalĕḇ son of Yephunneh as his possession. 
Josh
21:13  But to the children of Aharon the
priest they gave Ḥeḇron with its open land – a city of refuge for
the slayer – and Liḇnah with its open land, 
Josh
21:14  and Yattir with its open land, and
Eshtemoa with its open land, 
Josh
21:15  and Ḥolon with its open
land, and Deḇir with its open land, 
Josh
21:16  and Ayin with its open land, and
Yuttah with its open land, and Bĕyth Shemesh with its open land – nine
cities from those two tribes. 
Josh
21:17  And from the tribe of Binyamin, Giḇ‛on
with its open land, Geḇa with its open land, 
Josh
21:18  Anathoth with its open land, and
Almon with its open land – four cities. 
Josh
21:19  All the cities of the children of
Aharon, the priests, were thirteen cities with their open lands. 
Josh
21:20  And the clans of the children of
Qehath, the Lĕwites, the rest of the children of Qehath, even they had the
cities of their lot from the tribe of Ephrayim. 
Josh
21:21  And they gave them Sheḵem
with its open land in the mountains of Ephrayim as a city of refuge for the
slayer, and Gezer with its open land, 
Josh
21:22  and Qiḇtsayim with its open
land, and Bĕyth Ḥoron with its open land – four cities. 
Josh
21:23  And from the tribe of Dan, Elteqĕh
with its open land, Gibbethon with its open land, 
Josh
21:24  Ayalon with its open land, and
Gath Rimmon with its open land – four cities. 
Josh
21:25  And from the half-tribe of
Menashsheh, Ta‛naḵ with its open land, and Gath Rimmon with its
open land – two cities. 
Josh
21:26  All the ten cities with their open
lands were for the rest of the clans of the children of Qehath. 
Josh
21:27  And to the children of Gĕrshon,
of the clans of the Lĕwites, from the other half-tribe of Menashsheh, they
gave Golan in Bashan with its open land as a city of refuge for the slayer, and
Be‛eshterah with its open land – two cities. 
Josh
21:28  And from the tribe of Yissasḵar,
Qishyon with its open land, Daḇerath with its open land, 
Josh
21:29  Yarmuth with its open land, and Ĕn
Gannim with its open land – four cities. 
Josh
21:30  And from the tribe of Ashĕr,
Mish’al with its open land, Aḇdon with its open land, 
Josh
21:31  Ḥelqath with its open land,
and Reḥoḇ with its open land – four cities. 
Josh
21:32  And from the tribe of Naphtali, Qeḏesh
in Galil with its open land as a city of refuge for the slayer, and Ḥammoth
Dor with its open land, and Qartan with its open land – three cities. 
Josh
21:33  All the cities of the Gĕrshonites
for their clans were thirteen cities with their open land. 
Josh
21:34  And to the clans of the children
of Merari, the rest of the Lĕwites, from the tribe of Zeḇulun, Yoqne‛am
with its open land, Qartah with its open land, 
Josh
21:35  Dimnah with its open land, Nahalal
with its open land – four cities. 
Josh
21:36  And from the tribe of Re’uḇĕn,
Betser with its open land, Yahtsah with its open land, 
Josh
21:37  Qeḏĕmoth with its open
land, and Mĕpha‛ath with its open land – four cities. 
Josh
21:38  And from the tribe of Gaḏ,
Ramoth in Gil‛aḏ with its open land as a city of refuge for the
slayer, and Maḥanayim with its open land, 
Josh
21:39  Ḥeshbon with its open land,
Ya‛zĕr with its open land – four cities in all. 
Josh
21:40  All the cities for the children of
Merari for their clans, the rest of the clans of the Lĕwites, were by
their lot twelve cities. 
Josh
21:41  All the cities of the Lĕwites
within the possession of the children of Yisra’ĕl were forty-eight cities
with their open lands. 
Josh
21:42  Each of these cities had its open
land surrounding it. So it was with all these cities. 
Josh
21:43  Thus יהוה
gave to Yisra’ĕl all the land of which He had sworn to give to their
fathers, and they took possession of it, and dwelt in it. 
Josh
21:44  And יהוה
gave them rest all around, according to all that He had sworn to their fathers.
And not a man of all their enemies stood against them, יהוה
gave all their enemies into their hand. 
Josh
21:45  Not a word failed of any good word
which יהוה had spoken to the house of Yisra’ĕl –
all came in. 
Josh
22:1  Then Yehoshua called for the Re’uḇĕnites,
and the Gaḏites, and half the tribe of Menashsheh, 
Josh
22:2  and said to them, “You, you have
guarded all that Mosheh the servant of יהוה commanded
you, and have obeyed my voice in all that I commanded you. 
Josh
22:3  “You have not left your brothers
these many days, up to this day, but have guarded the Charge, the command of יהוה
your Elohim. 
Josh
22:4  “And now יהוה
your Elohim has given rest to your brothers, as He promised them. So now,
return and go to your tents and to the land of your possession, which Mosheh
the servant of יהוה gave you beyond the Yardĕn. 
Josh
22:5  “Only, diligently guard to do the
command and the Torah which Mosheh the servant of יהוה
commanded you, to love יהוה your Elohim, and to walk in
all His ways, and to guard His commands, and to cling to Him, and to serve Him
with all your heart and with all your being.” 
Josh
22:6  And Yehoshua blessed them and sent
them away, and they went to their tents. 
Josh
22:7  And to half the tribe of Menashsheh
Mosheh had given a possession in Bashan, but to the other half of it Yehoshua gave land
among their brothers beyond the Yardĕn, westward. So when Yehoshua sent
them away to their tents, he also blessed them, 
Josh
22:8  and spoke to them, saying, “Return
to your tents with great riches, and with very much livestock, and with silver,
and with gold, and with bronze, and with iron, and with countless garments.
Divide the spoil of your enemies with your brothers.” 
Josh
22:9  And the children of Re’uḇĕn,
and the children of Gaḏ, and half the tribe of Menashsheh returned, and
left the children of Yisra’ĕl at Shiloh, which is in the land of Kena‛an,
to go to the land of Gil‛aḏ, to the land of their possession, which
they possessed according to the command of יהוה by the
hand of Mosheh. 
Josh
22:10  And they came to the districts of
the Yardĕn which is in the land of Kena‛an, and the children of Re’uḇĕn,
and the children of Gaḏ, and half the tribe of Menashsheh built an altar
there by the Yardĕn, a great conspicuous altar. 
Josh
22:11  And the children of Yisra’ĕl
heard it said, “See, the children of Re’uḇĕn, and the children of Gaḏ,
and half the tribe of Menashsheh have built an altar opposite the land of Kena‛an,
in the districts of the Yardĕn, at the border of the children of Yisra’ĕl.”

Josh
22:12  And when the children of Yisra’ĕl
heard, all the congregation of the children of Yisra’ĕl assembled at
Shiloh to go to fight against them. 
Josh
22:13  So the children of Yisra’ĕl
sent Pineḥas son of El‛azar the priest to the children of Re’uḇĕn,
and to the children of Gaḏ, and to half the tribe of Menashsheh, into the
land of Gil‛aḏ, 
Josh
22:14  and ten rulers with him, one ruler
each from the chief house of every tribe of Yisra’ĕl. And each one was the
head of the house of his father among the divisions of Yisra’ĕl. 
Josh
22:15  And they came to the children of
Re’uḇĕn and to the children of Gaḏ, and to half the tribe of
Menashsheh, to the land of Gil‛aḏ, and spoke with them, saying, 
Josh
22:16  “Thus says all the congregation of
יהוה, ‘What is this trespass you have committed against
the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, to turn away this day from following יהוה,
in that you have built for yourselves an altar, to rebel against יהוה
this day? 
Josh
22:17  ‘Is the crookedness of Pe‛or
not enough for us, from which we have not been cleansed till this day, although
there was a plague in the congregation of יהוה, 
Josh
22:18  that you turn away today from
following יהוה ? And it shall be, if you rebel today
against יהוה, that tomorrow He is wroth with all the
congregation of Yisra’ĕl. 
Josh
22:19  ‘And indeed, if the land of your
possession is unclean, then pass over to the land of the possession of יהוה,
where the Dwelling Place of יהוה dwells, and take
possession among us. But do not rebel against יהוה, nor
rebel against us, by building yourselves an altar besides the altar of יהוה
our Elohim. 
Josh
22:20  ‘Did not Aḵan son of
Zeraḥ commit a trespass in that which is under the ban, and wrath fell on
all the congregation of Yisra’ĕl? And he was not the only one to die in
his crookedness.’ ” 
Josh
22:21  Then the children of Re’uḇĕn,
and the children of Gaḏ, and half the tribe of Menashsheh answered and
said to the heads of the divisions of Yisra’ĕl, 
Josh
22:22  “Ĕl Elohim יהוה,
Ĕl Elohim יהוה, He knows, and let Yisra’ĕl
itself know. If this has been in rebellion, or if in trespass against יהוה,
do not save us this day. 
Josh
22:23  “If we have built ourselves an
altar to turn from following יהוה, or if to offer burnt
offerings or grain offerings on it, or if to make peace offerings on it, let יהוה
Himself require it. 
Josh
22:24  “But truly, from fear, for a
reason we did this, saying, ‘In time to come your sons might speak to our sons,
saying, “What have you to do with יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl?

Josh
22:25  “For יהוה
has made the Yardĕn a border between you and us, you children of Re’uḇĕn
and children of Gaḏ. You have no portion with יהוה.”
So your sons would make our sons stop fearing יהוה.’
Josh
22:26  “So we said, ‘Let us now prepare
to build ourselves an altar, not for burnt offering nor for slaughtering, 
Josh
22:27  but to be a witness between you
and us and our generations after us, to do the service of יהוה
before Him with our burnt offerings, with our slaughterings, and with our peace
offerings, that your sons should not say to our sons in time to come, “You have
no portion with יהוה.” ’
Josh
22:28  “So we said that it shall be, when
they say this to us or to our generations in time to come, that we shall say, ‘See
the pattern of the altar of יהוה which our fathers
made, though not for burnt offerings nor for slaughterings, but it is a witness
between you and us.’ 
Josh
22:29  “Far be it from us to rebel
against יהוה, and to turn from following יהוה
this day, to build an altar for burnt offerings, for grain offerings, or for
slaughterings, besides the altar of יהוה our Elohim
which is before His Dwelling Place.” 
Josh
22:30  And Pineḥas the priest and
the rulers of the congregation, and the heads of the thousands of Yisra’ĕl
who were with him, heard the words that the children of Re’uḇĕn, and
the children of Gaḏ, and the children of Menashsheh spoke, and it was
good in their eyes. 
Josh
22:31  And Pineḥas son of El‛azar
the priest said to the children of Re’uḇĕn, and to the children of
Gaḏ, and to the children of Menashsheh, “Today we know that יהוה
is in our midst, because you have not committed against יהוה
this trespass. Now you have delivered the children of Yisra’ĕl out of the
hand of יהוה.” 
Josh
22:32  And Pineḥas son of El‛azar
the priest, and the rulers, returned from the children of Re’uḇĕn
and the children of Gaḏ, from the land of Gil‛aḏ to the land
of Kena‛an, to the children of Yisra’ĕl, and brought back word to
them. 
Josh
22:33  So the matter was good in the eyes
of the children of Yisra’ĕl, and the children of Yisra’ĕl blessed
Elohim. And they spoke no more of going against to fight, to destroy the land
where the children of Re’uḇĕn and Gaḏ dwelt. 
Josh
22:34  And the children of Re’uḇĕn
and the children of Gaḏ called the altar, “A witness between us that יהוה
is Elohim.” 
Josh
23:1  And it came to be, a long time
after יהוה had given rest to Yisra’ĕl from all
their enemies round about, that Yehoshua was old, advanced in years. 
Josh
23:2  And Yehoshua called for all Yisra’ĕl,
and for their elders, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their
officers, and said to them, “I am old, advanced in years. 
Josh
23:3  “And you, you have seen all that יהוה
your Elohim has done to all these nations because of you, for יהוה
your Elohim is He who was fighting for you. 
Josh
23:4  “See, I have divided to you by lot
these nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from the Yardĕn,
with all the nations that I have cut off, as far as the Great Sea toward the
setting of the sun. 
Josh
23:5  “And יהוה
your Elohim thrust them out from before you, and shall drive them out from
before you, and you shall possess their land, as יהוה
your Elohim has promised you. 
Josh
23:6  “And you shall be very strong to
guard and to do all that is written in the Book of the Torah of Mosheh, so as
not to turn aside from it right or left, 
Josh
23:7  so as not to go in among these
nations, these who remain among you. And make no mention of the name of their
mighty ones, a nor swear by them, nor
serve them nor bow down to them.
Josh
23:8  “But cling to יהוה
your Elohim, as you have done to this day. 
Josh
23:9  “For יהוה
has driven out from before you great and strong nations. As for you, no one has
stood against you to this day. 
Josh
23:10  “One man of you put a thousand to
flight, for יהוה your Elohim is He who is fighting for
you, as He has promised you. 
Josh
23:11  “And you shall diligently guard
yourselves, to love יהוה your Elohim. 
Josh
23:12  “But if you do turn back at all,
and cling to the remnant of these nations, these that remain among you, and
intermarry with them, and go in to them and they to you, 
Josh
23:13  know for certain that יהוה
your Elohim shall no longer drive these nations out from before you. And they
shall be snares and traps to you, and a whip on your sides and thorns in your
eyes, until you perish from this good land which יהוה
your Elohim has given you. 
Josh
23:14  “And see, this day I am going the
way of all the earth. And you know in all your hearts and in all your beings
that not one word has failed of all the good words which יהוה
your Elohim spoke concerning you. All of it has come to you, and not one word
of them has failed. 
Josh
23:15  “And it shall be, that as every
good word has come upon you which יהוה your Elohim
promised you, so יהוה does bring upon you every evil
word, until He has destroyed you from this good land which יהוה
your Elohim has given you, 
Josh
23:16  when you transgress the covenant
of יהוה your Elohim, which He commanded you, and shall
go and serve other mighty ones, and bow down to them. And the displeasure of יהוה
shall burn against you, and you shall perish quickly from the good land which
He has given you.” 
Josh
24:1  And Yehoshua gathered all the
tribes of Yisra’ĕl to Sheḵem and called for the elders of Yisra’ĕl,
and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers. And they
presented themselves before Elohim. 
Josh
24:2  And Yehoshua said to all the
people, “Thus said יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, ‘Long
ago your fathers dwelt beyond the River – Teraḥ, the father of Aḇraham
and the father of Naḥor. And they served other mighty ones.b 
Josh
24:3  ‘So I took your father Aḇraham
from beyond the River, and caused him to go through all the land of Kena‛an,
and multiplied his offspring and gave him Yitsḥaq. 
Josh
24:4  ‘And to Yitsḥaq I gave Ya‛aqoḇ
and Ĕsaw. And to Ĕsaw I gave the mountains of Sĕ‛ir to
possess, but Ya‛aqoḇ and his children went down to Mitsrayim. 
Josh
24:5  ‘Then I sent Mosheh and Aharon, and
plagued Mitsrayim, as I did in their midst. And afterward I brought you out. 
Josh
24:6  ‘And I brought your fathers out of
Mitsrayim, and you came to the sea. And the Mitsrians pursued your fathers with
chariots and horsemen to the Sea of Reeds. 
Josh
24:7  ‘And they cried out to יהוה,
and He put thick darkness between you and the Mitsrians, and brought the sea
upon them, and covered them. And your eyes saw what I did in Mitsrayim. And you
dwelt in the wilderness a long time. 
Josh
24:8  ‘And I brought you into the land of
the Amorites, who dwelt beyond the Yardĕn, and they fought with you. But I
gave them into your hand, and you possessed their land, and I destroyed them
from before you. 
Josh
24:9  ‘And Balaq son of Tsippor, sovereign
of Mo’aḇ, rose up and fought against Yisra’ĕl, and sent and called
for Bil‛am son of Be‛or to curse you. 
Josh
24:10  ‘But I refused to listen to Bil‛am,
so he continued to bless you, and I delivered you out of his hand. 
Josh
24:11  ‘And you passed over the Yardĕn
and came to Yeriḥo. And the masters of Yeriḥo, the Amorite, and the
Perizzite, and the Kena‛anite, and the Ḥittite, and the Girgashite,
and the Ḥiwwite, and the Yeḇusite fought against you. But I gave
them into your hand. 
Josh
24:12  ‘And I sent the hornet before you
which drove them out from before you, also the two sovereigns of the Amorites,
but not with your sword or with your bow. 
Josh
24:13  ‘And I gave you a land for which
you did not labour, and cities which you did not build. And you dwell in them,
you eat of the vineyards and olive-trees which you did not plant.’ 
Josh
24:14  “And now, fear יהוה,
serve Him in perfection and in truth, and put away the mighty ones which your
fathers served beyond the River and in Mitsrayim, and serve יהוה
! 
Josh
24:15  “And if it seems evil in your eyes
to serve יהוה, choose for yourselves this day whom you
are going to serve, whether the mighty ones which your fathers served that were
beyond the River, or the mighty ones of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell.
But I and my house, we serve יהוה.” 
Josh
24:16  And the people answered and said, “Far
be it from us to forsake יהוה, to serve other mighty
ones, 
Josh
24:17  for יהוה
our Elohim is He who has brought us and our fathers up out of the land of
Mitsrayim, from the house of bondage, who did those great signs before our
eyes, and has guarded us in all the way that we went and among all the people
through whom we passed. 
Josh
24:18  “And יהוה
drove out from before us all the people, even the Amorites who dwelt in the
land. We too serve יהוה, for He is our Elohim.” 
Josh
24:19  Then Yehoshua said to the people, “You
are not able to serve יהוה, for He is a set-apart
Elohim, a jealous Ĕl is He. He does not bear with your transgression and
with your sins,
Josh
24:20  if you forsake יהוה
and shall serve mighty ones of a stranger. Then He shall turn back and do you
evil and consume you, after He has been good to you.” 
Josh
24:21  And the people said to Yehoshua, “No,
but we do serve יהוה !” 
Josh
24:22  Then Yehoshua said to the people, “You
are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen יהוה
for yourselves, to serve Him.” And they said, “Witnesses!” 
Josh
24:23  “And now, put away the mighty ones
of the stranger which are in your midst, and incline your heart to יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl.” 
Josh
24:24  And the people said to Yehoshua, “
יהוה our Elohim we serve, and His voice we obey.” 
Josh
24:25  And Yehoshua made a covenant with
the people that day, and laid on them a law and a right-ruling in Sheḵem.

Josh
24:26  Then Yehoshua wrote these words in
the Book of the Torah of Elohim. And he took a large stone, and set it up there
under the oak that was by the set-apart place of יהוה. 
Josh
24:27  And Yehoshua said to all the
people, “See, this stone is a witness to us, for it has heard all the words of יהוה
which He spoke to us. And it shall be a witness against you, lest you lie
against your Elohim.” 
Josh
24:28  Then Yehoshua sent the people
away, each to his own inheritance. 
Josh
24:29  And after these events it came to
be that Yehoshua son of Nun, the servant of יהוה, died,
one hundred and ten years old. 
Josh
24:30  And they buried him within the
border of his inheritance at Timnath Seraḥ, which is in the mountains of
Ephrayim, on the north side of Mount Ga‛ash. 
Josh
24:31  And Yisra’ĕl served יהוה
all the days of Yehoshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Yehoshua,
who had known all the works of יהוה which He had done
for Yisra’ĕl. 
Josh
24:32  And the bones of Yosĕph,
which the children of Yisra’ĕl had brought up out of Mitsrayim, they
buried at Sheḵem, in the plot of ground which Ya‛aqoḇ had
bought from the sons of Ḥamor the father of Sheḵem for one hundred
pieces of silver, and which had become an inheritance of the children of Yosĕph.

Josh
24:33  And El‛azar son of Aharon
died, and they buried him in a hill that belonged to Pineḥas his son,
which was given to him in the hill country of Ephrayim.
