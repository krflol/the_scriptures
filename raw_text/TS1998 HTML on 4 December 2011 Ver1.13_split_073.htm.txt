Yoḥanan Aleph/1 John
1John
1:1  What was from the beginning, what we
have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we have looked upon, and our
hands have handled, concerning the Word of life: 
1John
1:2  And the life was manifested, and we
have seen, and bear witness, and announce to you that everlasting life which
was with the Father and was manifested to us. 
1John
1:3  We announce to you what we have seen
and heard, so that you too might have fellowship with us. And truly our
fellowship is with the Father and with His Son יהושע
Messiah. 
1John
1:4  And we write this to you in order
that your joy might be complete. 
1John
1:5  And this is the message which we
have heard from Him and announce to you, that Elohim is light and in Him is no
darkness at all. 
1John
1:6  If we say that we have fellowship
with Him, and walk in darkness, we lie and are not doing the truth. 
1John
1:7  But if we walk in the light as He is
in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of יהושע
Messiah His Son cleanses us from all sin. 
1John
1:8  If we say that we have no sin, we
are misleading ourselves, and the truth is not in us. 
1John
1:9  If we confess our sins, He is
trustworthy and righteous to forgive us the sins and cleanse us from all
unrighteousness. 
1John
1:10  If we say that we have not sinned,
we make Him a liar, and His Word is not in us. 
1John
2:1  My little children, I write this to
you, so that you do not sin. And if anyone sins, we have an Intercessor with
the Father, יהושע Messiah, a righteous One. 
1John
2:2  And He Himself is an atoning offering
for our sins, and not for ours only but also for all the world. 
1John
2:3  And by this we know that we know
Him, if we guard His commands.
1John
2:4  The one who says, “I know Him,” and
does not guard His commands, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. 
1John
2:5  But whoever guards His Word, truly
the love of Elohim has been perfected in him. By this we know that we are in
Him.
1John
2:6  The one who says he stays in Him
ought himself also to walk, even as He walked. 
1John
2:7  Beloved, I write no fresh command to
you, but an old command which you have had from the beginning. The old command
is the Word which you heard from the beginning.
1John
2:8  Again I write you a fresh command,
which is true in Him and in you, because the darkness is passing away, and the
true light now shines. 
1John
2:9  The one who says he is in the light,
and hates his brother, is in the darkness until now. 
1John
2:10  The one who loves his brother stays
in the light, and there is no stumbling-block in him. 
1John
2:11  But the one who hates his brother
is in the darkness and walks in the darkness, and does not know where he is
going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes. 
1John
2:12  I write to you, little children,
because your sins have been forgiven on account of His Name. 
1John
2:13  I write to you, fathers, because
you have known Him from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you
have overcome the wicked one. I write to you, little children, because you have
known the Father. 
1John
2:14  I wrote to you, fathers, because
you have known Him from the beginning. I wrote to you, young men, because you
are strong, and the Word of Elohim stays in you, and you have overcome the
wicked one. 
1John
2:15  Do not love the world nor that
which is in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not
in him.
1John
2:16  Because all that is in the world –
the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life – is not of
the Father but is of the world. 
1John
2:17  And the world passes away, and the
lust of it, but the one doing the desire of Elohim remains forever. 
1John
2:18  Little children, it is the last
hour. And as you have heard that the anti-messiah is coming, even now many
anti-messiahs have come. This is how we know that it is the last hour. 
1John
2:19  They went out from us, but they
were not of us, for if they had been of us, they would have stayed with us –
but in order that it might be made manifest that none of them were of us. 
1John
2:20  And you have an anointing from the
Set-apart One, and you know all. 
1John
2:21  I did not write to you because you
do not know the truth, but because you know it, and because no falsehood is of
the truth. 
1John
2:22  Who is the liar, except the one
denying that יהושע is the Messiah? This is the
anti-messiah, the one denying the Father and the Son. 
1John
2:23  No one denying the Son has the
Father. The one confessing the Son has the Father as well. 
1John
2:24  As for you, let that stay in you
which you heard from the beginning. If what you heard from the beginning stays
in you, you also shall stay in the Son and in the Father. 
1John
2:25  And this is the promise that He has
promised us: everlasting life. 
1John
2:26  I have written this to you
concerning those who lead you astray. 
1John
2:27  But the anointing which you have
received from Him stays in you, and you have no need that anyone should teach
you. But as the same anointing does teach you concerning all, and is true, and
is no falsehood, and even as it has taught you, you stay in Him.  
1John
2:28  And now, little children, stay in
Him, so that when He appears, we might have boldness and not be ashamed before
Him at His coming. 
1John
2:29  If you know that He is righteous,
you know that everyone doing righteousness has been born of Him.
1John
3:1  See what love the Father has given
us, that we should be called children of Elohim! For this reason the world does
not know us, because it did not know Him. 
1John
3:2  Beloved ones, now we are children of
Elohim. And it has not yet been revealed what we shall be, but we know that
when He is revealed, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is. 
1John
3:3  And everyone having this expectation
in Him cleanses himself, as He is clean. 
1John
3:4  Everyone doing sin also does
lawlessness, and sin is lawlessness.
1John
3:5  And you know that He was manifested
to take away our sins, and in Him there is no sin. 
1John
3:6  Everyone staying in Him does not
sin. Everyone sinning has neither seen Him nor known Him.
1John
3:7  Little children, let no one lead you
astray. The one doing righteousness is righteous, even as He is righteous.
1John
3:8  The one doing sin is of the devil,
because the devil has sinned from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of
Elohim was manifested: to destroy the works of the devil.
1John
3:9  Everyone having been born of Elohim
does not sin, because His seed stays in him, and he is powerless to sin,
because he has been born of Elohim. 
1John
3:10  In this the children of Elohim and
the children of the devil are manifest: Everyone not doing righteousness is not
of Elohim, neither the one not loving his brother.
1John
3:11  Because this is the message that
you heard from the beginning, that we should love one another, 
1John
3:12  not as Qayin who was of the wicked
one and killed his brother. And why did he kill him? Because his works were
wicked but those of his brother were righteous. 
1John
3:13  Do not marvel, my brothers, if the
world hates you.
1John
3:14  We know that we have passed out of death
into life, because we love the brothers. The one not loving his brother stays
in death. 
1John
3:15  Everyone hating his brother is a
murderer, and you know that no murderer has everlasting life staying in him. 
1John
3:16  By this we have known love, because
He laid down His life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers. 
1John
3:17  But whoever has this world’s goods,
and sees his brother in need, and shuts up his tender affections from him, how
does the love of Elohim stay in him? 
1John
3:18  My little children, let us not love
in word or in tongue, but in deed and in truth. 
1John
3:19  And by this we know that we are of
the truth, and shall set our hearts at rest before Him, 
1John
3:20  that if our heart condemns us,
Elohim is greater than our heart, and knows all. 
1John
3:21  Beloved ones, if our heart does not
condemn us, we have boldness toward Elohim. 
1John
3:22  And whatever we ask we receive from
Him, because we guard His commands and do what is pleasing in His sight.
1John
3:23  And this is His command, that we
should believe in the Name of His Son יהושע
Messiah and love one another, as He gave us command. 
1John
3:24  And the one guarding His commands
stays in Him, and He in him. And by this we know that He stays in us, by the
Spirit which He gave us.
1John
4:1  Beloved ones, do not believe every
spirit, but prove the spirits, whether they are of Elohim, because many false
prophets have gone out into the world. 
1John
4:2  By this you know the Spirit of
Elohim: Every spirit that confesses that יהושע
Messiah has come in the flesh is of Elohim, 
1John
4:3  and every spirit that does not
confess that יהושע Messiah has come in the flesh
is not of Elohim. And this is the spirit
of the anti-messiah which you heard is coming, and now is already in the world.

1John
4:4  You are of Elohim, little children,
and have overcome them, because He who is in you is greater than he who is in
the world.
1John
4:5  They are of the world, therefore
they speak as of the world, and the world hears them. 
1John
4:6  We are of Elohim – the one knowing
Elohim hears us. He who is not of Elohim does not hear us. By this we know the
Spirit of the Truth and the spirit of the delusion. 
1John
4:7  Beloved ones, let us love one
another, because love is of Elohim, and everyone who loves has been born of
Elohim, and knows Elohim. 
1John
4:8  The one who does not love does not
know Elohim, for Elohim is love. 
1John
4:9  By this the love of Elohim was
manifested in us, that Elohim has sent His only brought-forth Son into the
world, in order that we might live through Him. 
1John
4:10  In this is love, not that we loved
Elohim, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be an atoning offering for our
sins. 
1John
4:11  Beloved ones, if Elohim so loved
us, we also ought to love one another. 
1John
4:12  No one has seen Elohim at any time.
If we love one another, Elohim does stay in us, and His love has been perfected
in us. 
1John
4:13  By this we know that we stay in
Him, and He in us, because He has given us of His Spirit. 
1John
4:14  And we have seen and bear witness
that the Father has sent the Son, Saviour of the world. 
1John
4:15  Whoever confesses that יהושע
is the Son of Elohim, Elohim stays in him, and he in Elohim. 
1John
4:16  And we have known and believed the
love that Elohim has for us. Elohim is love, and he who stays in love stays in
Elohim, and Elohim in him. 
1John
4:17  By this love has been perfected
with us, in order that we might have boldness in the day of judgment, because
as He is so are we in this world. 
1John
4:18  There is no fear in love, but
perfect love casts out fear, because fear holds punishment, and he who fears
has not been made perfect in love. 
1John
4:19  We love Him because He first loved
us. 
1John
4:20  If someone says, “I love Elohim,”
and hates his brother, he is a liar. For the one not loving his brother whom he
has seen, how is he able to love Elohim whom he has not seen? 
1John
4:21  And we have this command from Him,
that the one loving Elohim should love his brother too. 
1John
5:1  Everyone who believes that יהושע
is the Messiah has been born of Elohim, and everyone who loves the One bringing
forth also loves the one having been born of Him. 
1John
5:2  By this we know that we love the
children of Elohim, when we love Elohim and guard His commands. 
1John
5:3  For this is the love for Elohim,
that we guard His commands, and His commands are not heavy,
1John
5:4  because everyone having been born of
Elohim overcomes the world. And this is the overcoming that has overcome the
world: our belief. 
1John
5:5  Who is the one who overcomes the
world but he who believes that יהושע is the Son
of Elohim? 
1John
5:6  This is the One that came by water
and blood: יהושע Messiah, not only by water, but
by water and blood. And it is the Spirit who bears witness, because the Spirit
is the Truth. 
1John
5:7  Because there are three who bear
witness: 
1John
5:8  the Spirit, and the water, and the
blood. And the three are in agreement. 
1John
5:9  If we receive the witness of men,
the witness of Elohim is greater, because this is the witness of Elohim which
He has witnessed concerning His Son. 
1John
5:10  The one who believes in the Son of
Elohim has the witness in himself, the one who does not believe Elohim has made
Him a liar, because he has not believed the witness that Elohim has given
concerning His Son. 
1John
5:11  And this is the witness: that
Elohim has given us everlasting life, and this life is in His Son. 
1John
5:12  He who possesses the Son possesses
life, he who does not possess the Son of Elohim does not possess life. 
1John
5:13  I have written this to you who
believe in the Name of the Son of Elohim, so that you know that you possess
everlasting life, and so that you believe in the Name of the Son of Elohim. 
1John
5:14  And this is the boldness that we
have in Him, that if we ask whatever according to His desire, He hears us. 
1John
5:15  And if we know that He hears us,
whatever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we have asked of Him. 
1John
5:16  If anyone sees his brother sinning
a sin, not unto death, he shall ask, and He shall give him life for those not
sinning unto death. There is a sin unto death. I do not say that he should pray
about that. 
1John
5:17  All unrighteousness is sin, and
there is a sin not unto death. 
1John
5:18  We know that everyone having been
born of Elohim does not sin, but the one having been born of Elohim guards
himself, and the wicked one does not touch him.
1John
5:19  We know that we are of Elohim, and
all the world lies in the wicked one. 
1John
5:20  And we know that the Son of Elohim
has come and has given us an understanding, so that we might know the true One.
And we are in the true One, in His Son יהושע
Messiah. This is the true Elohim and everlasting life. 
1John
5:21  Little children, keep yourselves
from idols. Amĕn.
