Shemu’ĕl Bĕt/2 Samuel
2Sam
1:1  And it came to be after the death of
Sha’ul, when Dawiḏ had returned from smiting the Amalĕqites, that
Dawiḏ remained two days in Tsiqlaḡ. 
2Sam
1:2  And it came to be on the third day,
that see, a man came out of the camp from Sha’ul with his garments torn and
dust on his head. And it came to be, when he came to Dawiḏ, that he fell
to the ground and did obeisance. 
2Sam
1:3  And Dawiḏ said to him, “From
where do you come?” And he said to him, “I have escaped from the camp of Yisra’ĕl.”

2Sam
1:4  And Dawiḏ said to him, “What
was the matter? Please inform me.” And he said, “The people have fled from the
battle, and also many of the people have fallen and are dead, and Sha’ul and
Yehonathan his son are dead too.” 
2Sam
1:5  And Dawiḏ said to the young
man who informed him, “How do you know that Sha’ul and Yehonathan his son are
dead?” 
2Sam
1:6  And the young man who informed him
said, “By chance I was on Mount Gilboa and saw Sha’ul leaning on his spear. And
see, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him. 
2Sam
1:7  “And when he looked behind him, he
saw me and called to me, and I answered, ‘Here I am.’ 
2Sam
1:8  “And he said to me, ‘Who are you?’
So I answered him, ‘I am an Amalĕqite.’ 
2Sam
1:9  “And he said to me, ‘Please stand
over me and put me to death, for agony has seized me, but my life is still in
me.’ 
2Sam
1:10  “So I stood beside him and put him
to death, for I knew he would not live after he had fallen. And I took the
diadem that was on his head and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have
brought them here to my master.” 
2Sam
1:11  And Dawiḏ took hold of his
own garments and tore them, and also all the men who were with him. 
2Sam
1:12  And they mourned and wept and
fasted until evening for Sha’ul and for Yehonathan his son, and for the people
of יהוה and for the house of Yisra’ĕl, because
they had fallen by the sword. 
2Sam
1:13  Then Dawiḏ asked the young
man who informed him, “Where are you from?” And he answered, “I am the son of a
sojourner, an Amalĕqite.” 
2Sam
1:14  And Dawiḏ said to him, “How
was it you were not afraid to stretch out your hand to destroy the anointed of יהוה
?” 
2Sam
1:15  And Dawiḏ called one of the
young men and said, “Draw near and fall on him!” And he smote him so that he
died. 
2Sam
1:16  And Dawiḏ said to him, “Your
blood is on your own head, for your own mouth has witnessed against you,
saying, ‘I myself have put to death the anointed of יהוה.’
” 
2Sam
1:17  Then Dawiḏ lamented with this
lamentation over Sha’ul and over Yehonathan his son, 
2Sam
1:18  and he ordered “The Bow” to be
taught to the children of Yehuḏah. See, it is written in the Book of
Yashar: 
2Sam
1:19  “The splendour of Yisra’ĕl Is
slain on your high places! How the mighty have fallen!
2Sam
1:20  “Declare it not in Gath, Proclaim
it not in the streets of Ashqelon, Lest the daughters of the Philistines
rejoice, Lest the daughters of the uncircumcised exult.
2Sam
1:21  “Mountains of Gilboa! No dew or
rain be upon you, Nor fields of offerings. For there the shield of the mighty
lay rejected, The shield of Sha’ul, not anointed with oil.
2Sam
1:22  “From the blood of the slain, From
the fat of the mighty, The bow of Yehonathan did not turn back, And the sword
of Sha’ul did not return empty.
2Sam
1:23  “Sha’ul and Yehonathan were beloved
And pleasant in their lives, And in their death they were not parted. They were
swifter than eagles, They were stronger than lions.
2Sam
1:24  “Daughters of Yisra’ĕl – weep
over Sha’ul, Who wrapped you in scarlet, with finery; Who decked your robes
with ornaments of gold.
2Sam
1:25  “How the mighty have fallen In the
midst of the battle! Yehonathan was slain in your high places.
2Sam
1:26  “I am distressed for you, my brother
Yehonathan. You have been very pleasant to me. Your love to me was wondrous,
Surpassing the love of women.
2Sam
1:27  “How the mighty have fallen, And
the weapons of battle perish!”
2Sam
2:1  And it came to be afterwards that
Dawiḏ inquired of יהוה, saying, “Do I go up to
any of the cities of Yehuḏah?” And יהוה said to
him, “Go up.” And Dawiḏ said, “Where should I go up?” And He said, “To Ḥeḇron.”

2Sam
2:2  And Dawiḏ went up there, as
well as his two wives, Aḥino‛am the Yizre‛ĕlitess, and Aḇiḡayil
the widow of Naḇal the Karmelite.
2Sam
2:3  And Dawiḏ brought up the men
who were with him, each man with his household, and they dwelt in the cities of
Ḥeḇron. 
2Sam
2:4  And the men of Yehuḏah came,
and anointed Dawiḏ sovereign over the house of Yehuḏah there. They
also reported to Dawiḏ, saying, “The men of Yaḇĕsh Gil‛aḏ
are they who buried Sha’ul.” 
2Sam
2:5  Dawiḏ then sent messengers to
the men of Yaḇĕsh Gil‛aḏ, and said to them, “You are
blessed of יהוה, for you have shown this kindness to
your master, to Sha’ul, that you buried him.
2Sam
2:6  “And now, יהוה
show kindness and truth to you, and I am also going to do you good, because you
have done this deed. 
2Sam
2:7  “And now, let your hands be
strengthened and be brave, for your master Sha’ul is dead, and also the house
of Yehuḏah has anointed me sovereign over them.”
2Sam
2:8  But Aḇnĕr son of Nĕr,
commander of the army of Sha’ul, took Ishbosheth the son of Sha’ul, and brought
him over to Maḥanayim,
2Sam
2:9  and set him up to reign over Gil‛aḏ,
and over the Ashĕrites, and over Yizre‛ĕl, and over Ephrayim,
and over Binyamin, and over all Yisra’ĕl. 
2Sam
2:10  Ishbosheth, son of Sha’ul, was
forty years old when he began to reign over Yisra’ĕl, and he reigned two
years. Only the house of Yehuḏah followed Dawiḏ. 
2Sam
2:11  And the time that Dawiḏ was
sovereign in Ḥeḇron over the house of Yehuḏah was seven years
and six months. 
2Sam
2:12  And Aḇnĕr son of Nĕr,
and the servants of Ishbosheth son of Sha’ul, went out from Maḥanayim to
Giḇ‛on. 
2Sam
2:13  And Yo’aḇ son of Tseruyah,
and the servants of Dawiḏ, went out and met them by the pool of Giḇ‛on.
And they sat down, one on one side of the pool and the other on the other side
of the pool. 
2Sam
2:14  And Aḇnĕr said to Yo’aḇ,
“Let the young men now rise and compete before us.” And Yo’aḇ said, “Let
them rise.” 
2Sam
2:15  And they rose and went over by
number, twelve from Binyamin, followers of Ishbosheth son of Sha’ul, and twelve
from the servants of Dawiḏ. 
2Sam
2:16  And each one grasped his opponent
by the head and thrust his sword in
his opponent’s side, and they fell down together. So that place was called the
Field of Sharp Swords, which is in Giḇ‛on. 
2Sam
2:17  And the battle was fierce that day,
and Aḇnĕr and the men of Yisra’ĕl were smitten before the
servants of Dawiḏ. 
2Sam
2:18  And there were three sons of
Tseruyah there, Yo’aḇ and Aḇishai and Asah’ĕl. And Asah’ĕl
was light on his feet, as one of the gazelles in the field. 
2Sam
2:19  And Asah’ĕl pursued Aḇnĕr,
and in going he did not turn aside to the right or to the left from following Aḇnĕr.
2Sam
2:20  And Aḇnĕr looked behind
him and said, “Are you Asah’ĕl?” And he answered, “I am.”
2Sam
2:21  And Aḇnĕr said to him, “Turn
aside to your right hand or to your left, and lay hold on one of the young men
and take his armour for yourself.” But Asah’ĕl would not turn aside from
following him. 
2Sam
2:22  And Aḇnĕr again said to
Asah’ĕl, “Turn aside from following me. Why should I smite you to the
ground? How then could I face your brother Yo’aḇ?”
2Sam
2:23  But he refused to turn aside, and Aḇnĕr
smote him with the blunt end of the spear in the stomach, so that the spear
came out of his back. And he fell down there and died on the spot. And it came
to be that as many as came to the place where Asah’ĕl fell down and died,
stood still. 
2Sam
2:24  And Yo’aḇ and Aḇishai
pursued Aḇnĕr. And the sun was going down and they came to the hill
of Ammah, which overlooks Giyaḥ by the way to the Wilderness of Giḇ‛on.

2Sam
2:25  And the children of Binyamin
gathered together behind Aḇnĕr and became a single company, and took
their stand on top of a hill.
2Sam
2:26  And Aḇnĕr called to Yo’aḇ
and said, “Should the sword devour forever? Do you not know that it is bitter
in the latter end? And when are you going to say to the people to turn back
from pursuing their brothers?” 
2Sam
2:27  And Yo’aḇ said, “As Elohim
lives, if you had not spoken, then all the people would have given up pursuing
their brothers only the next morning.” 
2Sam
2:28  Yo’aḇ then blew a ram’s horn,
and all the people halted and pursued Yisra’ĕl no further, nor did they
fight any more. 
2Sam
2:29  And Aḇnĕr and his men
went on all that night through the desert plain, and passed over the Yardĕn,
and went through all Bithron. And they came to Maḥanayim. 
2Sam
2:30  And Yo’aḇ turned back from
pursuing Aḇnĕr. And when he had gathered all the people together,
there were missing of Dawiḏ’s servants nineteen men and Asah’ĕl. 
2Sam
2:31  But the servants of Dawiḏ had
smitten, of Binyamin and Aḇnĕr’s men, three hundred and sixty men
who died. 
2Sam
2:32  And they brought Asah’ĕl and
buried him in his father’s tomb, which was in Bĕyth Leḥem. And Yo’aḇ
and his men went all night, and they came to Ḥeḇron at daybreak. 
2Sam
3:1  And the fighting between the house of
Sha’ul and the house of Dawiḏ was long drawn out. But Dawiḏ grew
stronger and stronger, and the house of Sha’ul grew weaker and weaker. 
2Sam
3:2  And sons were born to Dawiḏ in
Ḥeḇron. And his first-born was Amnon by Aḥino‛am the
Yizre‛ĕlitess; 
2Sam
3:3  and his second, Kil’aḇ, by Aḇiḡayil
the widow of Naḇal the Karmelite; and the third, Aḇshalom son of Ma‛aḵah,
the daughter of Talmai, sovereign of Geshur; 
2Sam
3:4  and the fourth, Aḏoniyah son
of Ḥaggith; and the fifth, Shephatyah son of Aḇital;
2Sam
3:5  and the sixth, Yithre‛am, by
Dawiḏ’s wife Eḡlah. These were born to Dawiḏ in Ḥeḇron.
2Sam
3:6  And it came to be, while there was
fighting between the house of Sha’ul and the house of Dawiḏ, that Aḇnĕr
was strengthening himself in the house of Sha’ul. 
2Sam
3:7  And Sha’ul had a concubine, whose
name was Ritspah, daughter of Ayah. And Ishbosheth
said to Aḇnĕr, “Why have you gone in to my father’s concubine?” 
2Sam
3:8  And Aḇnĕr was very
displeased at the words of Ishbosheth, and said, “Am I a dog’s head that
belongs to Yehuḏah, that I show kindness to the house of Sha’ul your
father, to his brothers, and to his friends today, and have not let you fall
into the hand of Dawiḏ, that you charge me today with a sin concerning
this woman? 
2Sam
3:9  “Elohim does so to Aḇnĕr,
and more also, if I do not do for Dawiḏ as יהוה
has sworn to him: 
2Sam
3:10  to cause the reign to pass over
from the house of Sha’ul, and to raise up the throne of Dawiḏ over Yisra’ĕl
and over Yehuḏah, from Dan to Be’ĕrsheḇa.” 
2Sam
3:11  And he was unable to answer Aḇnĕr
another word, because he feared him. 
2Sam
3:12  And Aḇnĕr sent
messengers on his behalf to Dawiḏ, saying, “Whose is the land?” saying
also, “Make your covenant with me, and see, my hand is with you to bring all
Yisra’ĕl to you.” 
2Sam
3:13  And Dawiḏ said, “Good, I make
a covenant with you. Only one matter I am asking of you: you do not see my face
unless you first bring Miḵal, daughter of Sha’ul, when you come to see my
face.” 
2Sam
3:14  Dawiḏ then sent messengers to
Ishbosheth son of Sha’ul, saying, “Give me my wife Miḵal, to whom I
became engaged for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.” 
2Sam
3:15  And Ishbosheth sent and took her
from her husband, from Palti’ĕl son of Layish. 
2Sam
3:16  But her husband went with her to
Baḥurim, going on and weeping behind her. And Aḇnĕr said to
him, “Go, turn back!” And he turned back. 
2Sam
3:17  And Aḇnĕr had a word
with the elders of Yisra’ĕl, saying, “In time past you were seeking for
Dawiḏ to be sovereign over you.
2Sam
3:18  “And now, do it! For יהוה
has spoken of Dawiḏ, saying, ‘By the hand of My servant Dawiḏ, I
save My people Yisra’ĕl from the hand of the Philistines and the hand of
all their enemies.’ ” 
2Sam
3:19  And Aḇnĕr also spoke in
the hearing of Binyamin. And Aḇnĕr also went to speak in the hearing
of Dawiḏ in Ḥeḇron all that seemed good to Yisra’ĕl and
all the house of Binyamin. 
2Sam
3:20  And Aḇnĕr and twenty men
with him came to Dawiḏ at Ḥeḇron. And Dawiḏ made a
feast for Aḇnĕr and the men who were with him. 
2Sam
3:21  And Aḇnĕr said to Dawiḏ,
“Let me arise and go, and gather all Yisra’ĕl to my master the sovereign,
and let them make a covenant with you, and you shall reign over all that your
being desires.” And Dawiḏ sent Aḇnĕr away, and he went in peace.

2Sam
3:22  And see, the servants of Dawiḏ
and Yo’aḇ came from a raid and brought much spoil with them. But Aḇnĕr
was not with Dawiḏ in Ḥeḇron, for he had sent him away, and
he had gone in peace. 
2Sam
3:23  And Yo’aḇ and all the army
that was with him came, and they reported to Yo’aḇ, saying, “Aḇnĕr
son of Nĕr came to the sovereign, and he sent him away, and he has gone in
peace.” 
2Sam
3:24  And Yo’aḇ went to the
sovereign and said, “What have you done? See, Aḇnĕr has come to you!
Why is it that you sent him away, and he has already gone? 
2Sam
3:25  “You know that Aḇnĕr son
of Nĕr came to deceive you, to know your going out and your coming in, and
to know all that you are doing.” 
2Sam
3:26  Yo’aḇ then left Dawiḏ,
and he sent messengers after Aḇnĕr, who brought him back from the
well of Sirah. But Dawiḏ did not know it. 
2Sam
3:27  Thus Aḇnĕr returned to Ḥeḇron,
and Yo’aḇ took him aside in the gate to speak with him privately, and
there struck him in the stomach, so that he died for the blood of Asah’ĕl
his brother. 
2Sam
3:28  And when Dawiḏ heard it
afterwards, he said, “My reign and I are guiltless before יהוה
forever of the blood of Aḇnĕr son of Nĕr. 
2Sam
3:29  “Let it rest on the head of Yo’aḇ
and on all his father’s house. And let there never fail to be in the house of
Yo’aḇ one who has a discharge or is a leper, who leans on a staff or
falls by the sword, or who lacks bread.” 
2Sam
3:30  So Yo’aḇ and Aḇishai
his brother slew Aḇnĕr, because he had killed their brother Asah’ĕl
at Giḇ‛on in the battle. 
2Sam
3:31  And Dawiḏ said to Yo’aḇ
and to all the people who were with him, “Tear your garments, gird yourselves
with sackcloth, and mourn for Aḇnĕr.” And Sovereign Dawiḏ
followed the coffin. 
2Sam
3:32  And they buried Aḇnĕr in
Ḥeḇron. And the sovereign lifted up his voice and wept at the grave
of Aḇnĕr, and all the people wept.
2Sam
3:33  And the sovereign sang a lament
over Aḇnĕr and said, “Should Aḇnĕr die as a fool dies? 
2Sam
3:34  “Your hands were not bound nor your
feet put into shackles. As one falls before sons of evil, so you fell.” And all
the people wept over him again. 
2Sam
3:35  And all the people came to cause
Dawiḏ to eat food while it was still day, but Dawiḏ swore, saying, “Elohim
do so to me, and more also, if I taste bread or whatever else till the sun goes
down!” 
2Sam
3:36  And all the people took note of it,
and it was good in their eyes, since whatever the sovereign did was good in the
eyes of all the people.
2Sam
3:37  And all the people and all Yisra’ĕl
knew that day that it had not been the sovereign’s intent to kill Aḇnĕr
son of Nĕr. 
2Sam
3:38  The sovereign also said to his
servants, “Do you not know that a prince and a great one has fallen in Yisra’ĕl
today? 
2Sam
3:39  “And I am weak today, though
anointed sovereign. And these men, the sons of Tseruyah, are too harsh for me.
Let יהוה repay the evil-doer according to his evil.” 
2Sam
4:1  And the son of Sha’ul heard that Aḇnĕr
had died in Ḥeḇron, and he lost heart, and all Yisra’ĕl was
troubled. 
2Sam
4:2  And the son of Sha’ul had two men,
commanders of bands, and the name of one was Ba‛anah and the name of the
other Rĕḵaḇ, sons of Rimmon the Be’ĕrothite, of the
children of Binyamin. For Be’ĕroth was also reckoned to Binyamin, 
2Sam
4:3  because the Be’ĕrothites fled
to Gittayim and have been sojourners there until this day. 
2Sam
4:4  Now Yehonathan, son of Sha’ul, had a
son who was lame in his feet. He was five years old when the news about Sha’ul
and Yehonathan came from Yizre‛ĕl, and his nurse took him up and
fled. And it came to be, as she hurried to flee, that he fell and became lame.
And his name was Mephiḇosheth. 
2Sam
4:5  So the sons of Rimmon the Be’ĕrothite,
Rĕḵaḇ and Ba‛anah, went and came at about the heat of the
day to the house of Ishbosheth, who was lying on his bed at noon. 
2Sam
4:6  And they came into the midst of the
house, to fetch wheat, and they struck him in the stomach, and Rĕḵaḇ
and Ba‛anah his brother escaped. 
2Sam
4:7  Thus they came into the house when
he was lying on his bed in his bedroom, and they smote him, and slew him, and
beheaded him. And they took his head, and went the way of the desert plain all
night, 
2Sam
4:8  and brought the head of Ishbosheth
to Dawiḏ at Ḥeḇron, and said to the sovereign, “See, the head
of Ishbosheth, the son of Sha’ul your enemy, who sought your life. So יהוה
has given my master the sovereign vengeance on Sha’ul and his seed this day.”  
2Sam
4:9  And Dawiḏ answered Rĕḵaḇ
and Ba‛anah his brother, sons of Rimmon the Be’ĕrothite, and said to
them, “As יהוה lives, who has redeemed my life out of
all distress, 
2Sam
4:10  when someone reported to me,
saying, ‘See, Sha’ul is dead,’ and he was a bearer of good news in his own
eyes, I then took hold of him and slew him in Tsiqlaḡ, which was the
reward I gave him for his news. 
2Sam
4:11  “How much more, when wrong men have
slain a righteous man in his own house on his bed, should I not now require his
blood at your hand and remove you from the earth?” 
2Sam
4:12  And Dawiḏ commanded his young
men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and feet, and hanged them by
the pool in Ḥeḇron. And they took the head of Ishbosheth and buried
it in the tomb of Aḇnĕr in Ḥeḇron. 
2Sam
5:1  And all the tribes of Yisra’ĕl
came to Dawiḏ at Ḥeḇron and spoke, saying, “Look, we are your
bone and your flesh. 
2Sam
5:2  “Formerly, when Sha’ul was sovereign
over us, you were the one who led Yisra’ĕl out and brought them in. And יהוה
said to you, ‘Shepherd My people Yisra’ĕl, and be ruler over Yisra’ĕl.’
” 
2Sam
5:3  And all the elders of Yisra’ĕl
came to the sovereign at Ḥeḇron, and Sovereign Dawiḏ made a
covenant with them at Ḥeḇron before יהוה.
And they anointed Dawiḏ sovereign over Yisra’ĕl. 
2Sam
5:4  Dawiḏ was thirty years old
when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years. 
2Sam
5:5  In Ḥeḇron he reigned
over Yehuḏah seven years and six months, and in Yerushalayim he reigned
thirty-three years over all Yisra’ĕl and Yehuḏah. 
2Sam
5:6  And the sovereign and his men went
to Yerushalayim against the Yeḇusites, the inhabitants of the land. And
they spoke to Dawiḏ, saying, “Except you take away the blind and the
lame, you are not going to come in here,” thinking, “Dawiḏ is not going
to come in here.” 
2Sam
5:7  But Dawiḏ captured the stronghold
of Tsiyon, the City of Dawiḏ. 
2Sam
5:8  And Dawiḏ said on that day, “Anyone
who smites the Yeḇusites, let him go by the water-shaft and take the lame and the blind, who are
hated by Dawiḏ’s being.” That is why they say, “The blind and the lame do
not come into the house.” 
2Sam
5:9  And Dawiḏ dwelt in the
stronghold, and called it the City of Dawiḏ. And Dawiḏ built all
around from the Millo and inward. 
2Sam
5:10  And Dawiḏ went on and became
great, and יהוה Elohim of hosts was with him. 
2Sam
5:11  Now Ḥiram sovereign of Tsor
sent messengers to Dawiḏ, and cedar trees, and carpenters and masons. And
they built a house for Dawiḏ. 
2Sam
5:12  And Dawiḏ knew that יהוה
had established him as sovereign over Yisra’ĕl, and that He had exalted
His reign, because of His people Yisra’ĕl. 
2Sam
5:13  And Dawiḏ took more
concubines and wives from Yerushalayim, after he had come from Ḥeḇron,
and more sons and daughters were born to Dawiḏ. 
2Sam
5:14  And these were the names of those
born to him in Yerushalayim: Shammua, and Shoḇaḇ, and Nathan, and
Shelomoh, 
2Sam
5:15  and Yiḇḥar, and
Elishua, and Nepheḡ, and Yaphiya, 
2Sam
5:16  and Elishama, and Elyaḏa, and
Eliphelet. 
2Sam
5:17  And the Philistines heard that they
had anointed Dawiḏ sovereign over Yisra’ĕl, and all the Philistines
went up to search for Dawiḏ, but Dawiḏ heard and went down to the
stronghold. 
2Sam
5:18  And the Philistines came and spread
themselves out in the Valley of Repha’im. 
2Sam
5:19  And Dawiḏ inquired of יהוה,
saying, “Do I go up against the Philistines? Do You give them into my hand?”
And יהוה said to Dawiḏ, “Go up, for I shall
certainly give the Philistines into your hand.” 
2Sam
5:20  And Dawiḏ came to Ba‛al
Peratsim, and Dawiḏ smote them there. And he said, “ יהוה
has broken through my enemies before me, like a breakthrough of water.” So he
called the name of that place Ba‛al Peratsim. 
2Sam
5:21  And they left their images there,
and Dawiḏ and his men took them away. 
2Sam
5:22  And the Philistines again came up
and were spread out in the Valley of Repha’im. 
2Sam
5:23  And when Dawiḏ inquired of יהוה,
He said, “Do not go up, turn around behind them, and you shall come upon them
in front of the mulberry trees. 
2Sam
5:24  “And it shall be, when you hear the
sound of stepping in the tops of the mulberry trees, then act promptly, for
then יהוה shall go out before you to smite the camp of
the Philistines.” 
2Sam
5:25  And Dawiḏ did so, as יהוה
commanded him, and smote the Philistines from Geḇa as far as Gezer. 
2Sam
6:1  Now Dawiḏ again gathered all
the chosen men of Yisra’ĕl, thirty thousand. 
2Sam
6:2  And Dawiḏ rose up and went
with all the people who were with him from Ba‛alĕ Yehuḏah, to
bring up from there the ark of Elohim, that is called by the Name, the Name יהוה
of Hosts, who dwells between the keruḇim. 
2Sam
6:3  And they placed the ark of Elohim on
a new wagon, and brought it from the house of Aḇinaḏaḇ, which
was on the hill. And Uzzah and Aḥyo, sons of Aḇinaḏaḇ,
were leading the new wagon. 
2Sam
6:4  And they brought it from the house
of Aḇinaḏaḇ, which was on the hill, with the ark of Elohim.
And Aḥyo was walking before the ark. 
2Sam
6:5  And Dawiḏ and all the house of
Yisra’ĕl were dancing before יהוה, with all instruments of fir wood, and with lyres,
and with harps, and with tambourines, and with sistrums, and with cymbals. 
2Sam
6:6  And when they came to the
threshing-floor of Naḵon, Uzzah reached out toward the ark of Elohim and
took hold of it, for the oxen stumbled.
2Sam
6:7  And the wrath of יהוה
burned against Uzzah, and Elohim smote him there for the fault. And he died
there by the ark of Elohim. 
2Sam
6:8  And Dawiḏ was displeased
because יהוה had broken out against Uzzah. And he
called the name of the place Perets Uzzah, until this day. 
2Sam
6:9  And Dawiḏ was afraid of יהוה
on that day, and said, “How shall the ark of יהוה come
to me?” 
2Sam
6:10  And Dawiḏ would not move the
ark of יהוה with him into the City of Dawiḏ, but
Dawiḏ turned it aside to the house of Oḇĕḏ-Eḏom
the Gittite. 
2Sam
6:11  And the ark of יהוה
remained in the house of Oḇĕḏ-Eḏom the Gittite three
months, and יהוה blessed Oḇĕḏ-Eḏom
and all his house. 
2Sam
6:12  And it was reported to Sovereign
Dawiḏ, saying, “ יהוה has blessed the house of Oḇĕḏ-Eḏom
and all that he has, because of the ark of Elohim.” Dawiḏ then went and
brought up the ark of Elohim from the house of Oḇĕḏ-Eḏom
to the City of Dawiḏ with rejoicing. 
2Sam
6:13  And it came to be, when those
bearing the ark of יהוה had gone six steps, that he
slaughtered bulls and fatted sheep. 
2Sam
6:14  And Dawiḏ danced before יהוה
with all his might. And Dawiḏ was wearing a linen shoulder garment. 
2Sam
6:15  Thus Dawiḏ and all the house
of Yisra’ĕl brought up the ark of יהוה with
shouting and with the sound of the ram’s horn. 
2Sam
6:16  And it came to be, when the ark of יהוה
came into the City of Dawiḏ, that Miḵal, daughter of Sha’ul, looked
through a window and saw Sovereign Dawiḏ leaping and dancing before יהוה,
and she despised him in her heart. 
2Sam
6:17  So they brought the ark of יהוה
in, and set it in its place in the midst of the Tent that Dawiḏ had
pitched for it. And Dawiḏ brought burnt offerings before יהוה,
and peace offerings. 
2Sam
6:18  And when Dawiḏ had finished
bringing burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the Name
of יהוה of hosts.
2Sam
6:19  And he apportioned to all the
people, to all the crowd of Yisra’ĕl, from man even to women, to each one
a loaf of bread, and a measure, and a cake of raisins. And all the people left,
each one to his house. 
2Sam
6:20  And Dawiḏ returned to bless
his household, and Miḵal the daughter of Sha’ul came out to meet Dawiḏ,
and said, “How esteemed was the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl today, uncovering
himself today in the eyes of the female servants of his servants, as one of the
foolish ones shamelessly uncovers himself!” 
2Sam
6:21  So Dawiḏ said to Miḵal,
“Before יהוה, who chose me instead of your father and
all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of יהוה,
over Yisra’ĕl, so I danced before יהוה. 
2Sam
6:22  “And I shall be even more slight
than this, and shall be humble in my own eyes. But as for the female servants
of whom you have spoken, by them I am esteemed.” 
2Sam
6:23  And Miḵal the daughter of Sha’ul
had no children to the day of her death. 
2Sam
7:1  And it came to be when the sovereign
was dwelling in his house, and יהוה had given him rest
from all his enemies all around, 
2Sam
7:2  that the sovereign said to Nathan
the prophet, “See now, I am dwelling in a house of cedar, but the ark of Elohim
dwells within curtains.” 
2Sam
7:3  And Nathan said to the sovereign, “Go,
do all that is in your heart, for יהוה is with you.” 
2Sam
7:4  And it came to be that night that
the word of יהוה came to Nathan, saying, 
2Sam
7:5  “Go and say to My servant Dawiḏ,
‘Thus said יהוה, “Would you build a house for Me to
dwell in? 
2Sam
7:6  “For I have not dwelt in a house
since the time that I brought the children of Yisra’ĕl up from Mitsrayim,
even to this day, but have moved about in a Tent and in a Dwelling Place. 
2Sam
7:7  “Wherever I have walked with all the
children of Yisra’ĕl, have I ever spoken a word to anyone from the tribes
of Yisra’ĕl, whom I commanded to shepherd My people Yisra’ĕl, saying,
‘Why have you not built Me a house of cedar?’ ” ’ 
2Sam
7:8  “And now, say to My servant Dawiḏ,
‘Thus said יהוה of hosts, “I took you from the pasture,
from following the flock, to be ruler over My people, over Yisra’ĕl. 
2Sam
7:9  “And I have been with you wherever
you have gone, and have cut off all your enemies from before you, and have made
you a great name, like the name of the great ones who are on the earth. 
2Sam
7:10  “And I shall appoint a place for My
people Yisra’ĕl, and shall plant them, and they shall dwell in a place of
their own and no longer be afraid, neither shall the children of wickedness
oppress them again, as at the first, 
2Sam
7:11  even from the day I appointed
rulers over My people Yisra’ĕl, and have caused you to rest from all your
enemies. And יהוה has declared to you that He would
make you a house. 
2Sam
7:12  “When your days are filled and you
rest with your fathers, I shall raise up your seed after you, who comes from
your inward parts, and shall establish his reign. 
2Sam
7:13  “He does build a house for My Name,
and I shall establish the throne of his reign forever. 
2Sam
7:14  “I am to be his Father, and he is
My son. If he does perversely, I shall reprove him with the rod of men and with
the blows of the sons of men. 
2Sam
7:15  “But My kindness does not turn
aside from him, as I turned it aside from Sha’ul, whom I removed from before
you. 
2Sam
7:16  “And your house and your reign are
to be steadfast forever before you – your throne is established forever.” ’ ” 
2Sam
7:17  According to all these words and
according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to Dawiḏ. 
2Sam
7:18  And Sovereign Dawiḏ went in
and sat before יהוה and he said, “Who am I, O Master יהוה
? And what is my house, that You have brought me this far?
2Sam
7:19  “And yet this was a small matter in
Your eyes, O Master יהוה. And You have also spoken of
Your servant’s house for a great while to come. And is this the teaching of
man, O Master יהוה ? 
2Sam
7:20  “And what more does Dawiḏ say
to You? For You, Master יהוה, know Your servant. 
2Sam
7:21  “Because of Your word, and
according to Your own heart, You have done all this greatness, to make it known
to Your servant. 
2Sam
7:22  “You are great indeed, O Master יהוה.
For there is none like You, and there is no Elohim but You, according to all
that we have heard with our ears. 
2Sam
7:23  “And who is like Your people, like
Yisra’ĕl, the one nation on the earth whom Elohim went to redeem for
Himself as a people, to make for Himself a Name, and to do for You greatness,
and awesome deeds for Your land before Your people, whom You redeemed for
Yourself from Mitsrayim, from the nations and their mighty ones? 
2Sam
7:24  “And You have established for
Yourself Your people Yisra’ĕl as Your own people forever, and You, יהוה,
have become their Elohim. 
2Sam
7:25  “And now, O יהוה
Elohim, the word which You have spoken concerning Your servant and concerning
his house, establish it forever and do as You have said. 
2Sam
7:26  “And let Your Name be made great
forever, saying, ‘ יהוה of hosts is the Elohim over
Yisra’ĕl.’ And let the house of Your servant Dawiḏ be established
before You. 
2Sam
7:27  “For You, O יהוה
of hosts, the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, have revealed this to Your servant,
saying, ‘I build you a house.’ Therefore Your servant has taken heart to pray
this prayer to You.
2Sam
7:28  “And now, O Master יהוה,
You are Elohim, and Your words are true, and You have spoken this goodness to
Your servant.
2Sam
7:29  “And now, be pleased to bless the
house of Your servant, to be before You, forever. For You, O Master יהוה,
have spoken it, and with Your blessing let the house of Your servant be blessed
forever.” 
2Sam
8:1  And after this it came to be that
Dawiḏ smote the Philistines and humbled them. And Dawiḏ took the
bridle of the mother city out of the hand of the Philistines. 
2Sam
8:2  He also smote Mo’aḇ, and
measured them off with a line, causing them to lie down on the earth. With two
lines he measured off those to be put to death, and with one complete line
those to be kept alive. And the Mo’aḇites became Dawiḏ’s servants,
and brought presents. 
2Sam
8:3  Dawiḏ also smote Haḏaḏezer
son of Reḥoḇ, sovereign of Tsoḇah, as he went to restore his
rule at the River Euphrates. 
2Sam
8:4  And Dawiḏ captured from him
one thousand and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand foot soldiers. And
Dawiḏ destroyed all the chariots, but he left of them a hundred chariots.

2Sam
8:5  And the Arameans of Damascus came to
help Haḏaḏezer sovereign of Tsoḇah, and Dawiḏ smote
twenty-two thousand of the Arameans. 
2Sam
8:6  Then Dawiḏ put watch-posts in
Aram of Damascus. And the Arameans became Dawiḏ’s servants, and brought
presents. And יהוה saved Dawiḏ wherever he went. 
2Sam
8:7  And Dawiḏ took the shields of
gold which were on the servants of Haḏaḏezer, and brought them to
Yerushalayim. 
2Sam
8:8  And from Betaḥ and from Bĕrothai,
cities of Haḏaḏezer, Sovereign Dawiḏ took very much bronze. 
2Sam
8:9  And To‛i sovereign of Ḥamath
heard that Dawiḏ had smitten all the army of Haḏaḏezer, 
2Sam
8:10  so To‛i sent Yoram his son to
Sovereign Dawiḏ, to ask peace of him and bless him, because he had fought
against Haḏaḏezer and smote him, for Haḏaḏezer had
battles with To‛i. And Yoram
brought with him objects of silver, and objects of gold, and objects of bronze.

2Sam
8:11  Sovereign Dawiḏ also set
these apart to יהוה, along with the silver and gold
that he had set apart from all the nations which he had humbled: 
2Sam
8:12  from Aram, and from Mo’aḇ,
and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalĕq,
and from the spoil of Haḏaḏezer son of Reḥoḇ, sovereign
of Tsoḇah.
2Sam
8:13  And Dawiḏ made a name for himself when he returned from
smiting eighteen thousand Arameans in the Valley of Salt. 
2Sam
8:14  And he put watch-posts in Eḏom.
Throughout all Eḏom he put watch-posts, and all the Eḏomites became
Dawiḏ’s servants. And יהוה saved Dawiḏ
wherever he went. 
2Sam
8:15  And Dawiḏ reigned over all
Yisra’ĕl, and Dawiḏ was doing right-ruling and righteousness to all
his people. 
2Sam
8:16  And Yo’aḇ son of Tseruyah was
over the army, and Yehoshaphat son of Aḥiluḏ was recorder, 
2Sam
8:17  and Tsaḏoq son of Aḥituḇ
and Aḥimeleḵ son of Eḇyathar were the priests, and Serayah
was the scribe, 
2Sam
8:18  and Benayahu son of Yehoyaḏa
was over both the Kerĕthites and the Pelĕthites, and Dawiḏ’s
sons were priests. 
2Sam
9:1  And Dawiḏ said, “Is there
still anyone who is left of the house of Sha’ul, that I might show him
kindness, because of Yehonathan?” 
2Sam
9:2  And the house of Sha’ul had a
servant whose name was Tsiḇa. And they had called him to Dawiḏ, and
the sovereign said to him, “Are you Tsiḇa?” And he said, “Your servant!” 
2Sam
9:3  And the sovereign said, “Is there
not still someone of the house of Sha’ul, so that I show him the kindness of
Elohim?” And Tsiḇa said to the sovereign, “There is still a son of
Yehonathan, lame in his feet.” 
2Sam
9:4  So the sovereign said to him, “Where
is he?” And Tsiḇa said to the sovereign, “See, he is in the house of Maḵir
son of Ammi’ĕl, in Lo Ḏeḇar.” 
2Sam
9:5  And Sovereign Dawiḏ sent and
brought him out of the house of Maḵir son of Ammi’ĕl, from Lo Ḏeḇar.

2Sam
9:6  And Mephiḇosheth son of
Yehonathan, son of Sha’ul, came to Dawiḏ, and fell on his face and did
obeisance. And Dawiḏ said, “Mephiḇosheth!” And he answered, “Here
is your servant!” 
2Sam
9:7  Dawiḏ then said to him, “Do
not fear, for I shall certainly show you kindness because of Yehonathan your
father, and shall return to you all the land of Sha’ul your grandfather, and
let you eat bread at my table continually.” 
2Sam
9:8  And he bowed himself and said, “What
is your servant, that you should turn to such a dead dog as I?” 
2Sam
9:9  And the sovereign called Tsiḇa
servant of Sha’ul, and said to him, “I have given to your master’s son all that
belonged to Sha’ul and to all his house. 
2Sam
9:10  “And you and your sons and your
servants, shall work the land for him, and you shall bring in its yield, and your master’s son shall
have food to eat. But let Mephiḇosheth your master’s son eat bread at my
table always.” And Tsiḇa had fifteen sons and twenty servants. 
2Sam
9:11  And Tsiḇa said to the
sovereign, “According to all that my master the sovereign has commanded his
servant, so your servant does.” “As for Mephiḇosheth,” said the sovereign, “he shall eat at my
table as one of the sons of the sovereign.” 
2Sam
9:12  And Mephiḇosheth had a young
son whose name was Miḵa. And all who dwelt in the house of Tsiḇa
were servants of Mephiḇosheth. 
2Sam
9:13  And Mephiḇosheth was dwelling
in Yerushalayim, for he ate continually at the sovereign’s table. And he was
lame in both his feet.
2Sam
10:1  And after this it came to be that
the sovereign of the children of Ammon died, and Ḥanun his son reigned in
his place. 
2Sam
10:2  And Dawiḏ said, “Let me show
kindness to Ḥanun son of Naḥash, as his father showed kindness to
me.” So Dawiḏ sent by the hand of his servants to comfort him concerning
his father. And when Dawiḏ’s servants came into the land of the children
of Ammon, 
2Sam
10:3  the chiefs of the children of Ammon
said to Ḥanun their master, “Is Dawiḏ esteeming your father in your
eyes in that he has sent comforters to you? Has Dawiḏ not rather sent his
servants to you to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?” 
2Sam
10:4  So Ḥanun took Dawiḏ’s
servants and shaved off half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the
middle, as far as their buttocks, and sent them away. 
2Sam
10:5  And they informed Dawiḏ, and
he sent to meet them, because the men were greatly ashamed. And the sovereign
said, “Wait at Yeriḥo until your beards have grown, and then return.” 
2Sam
10:6  And when the children of Ammon saw
that they had become a stench to Dawiḏ, the children of Ammon sent and
hired Arameans of Bĕyth Reḥoḇ and Arameans of Tsoḇa,
twenty thousand foot soldiers, and the sovereign of Ma‛aḵah, one
thousand men, and men of Toḇ, twelve thousand men. 
2Sam
10:7  And Dawiḏ heard, and sent Yo’aḇ
and the entire army, the mighty men. 
2Sam
10:8  And the children of Ammon came out
and put themselves in battle array at the entrance of the gate. And the Arameans
of Tsoḇa, and Reḥoḇ, and men of Toḇ, and Ma‛aḵah
were by themselves in the field. 
2Sam
10:9  And Yo’aḇ saw that the battle
line was against him before and behind, and he chose out of all the chosen men
of Yisra’ĕl and put them in battle array against the Arameans. 
2Sam
10:10  And the rest of the people he gave
under the hand of Aḇishai his brother, and he put them in battle array
against the children of Ammon. 
2Sam
10:11  And he said, “If the Arameans are
too strong for me, then you shall help me. But if the children of Ammon are too
strong for you, then I shall come and help you. 
2Sam
10:12  “Be strong, and let us show
strength for our people and for the cities of our Elohim, and let יהוה
do what is good in His eyes.” 
2Sam
10:13  And Yo’aḇ drew near, and the
people with him, to battle against Aram, and they fled before him. 
2Sam
10:14  And when the children of Ammon saw
that the Arameans were fleeing, they also fled before Aḇishai, and went
into the city. And Yo’aḇ returned from the children of Ammon and came to
Yerushalayim. 
2Sam
10:15  And Aram saw that they were
smitten before Yisra’ĕl, and they gathered together, 
2Sam
10:16  and Haḏaḏezer sent and
brought out the Arameans who were beyond the River, and they came to Ḥĕlam.
And Shoḇaḵ the commander of the army of Haḏaḏezer went
before them.
2Sam
10:17  And it was reported to Dawiḏ,
and he gathered all Yisra’ĕl, and passed over the Yardĕn, and came to
Ḥĕlam. And Aram set themselves in battle array against Dawiḏ
and they fought with him. 
2Sam
10:18  And Aram fled before Yisra’ĕl,
and Dawiḏ slew seven hundred charioteers and forty thousand horsemen of
Aram, and he smote Shoḇaḵ, commander of their army, who died there.

2Sam
10:19  And all the sovereigns, the
servants of Haḏaḏezer, saw that they were smitten by Yisra’ĕl,
and made peace with Yisra’ĕl, and served them. And the Arameans were
afraid to help the children of Ammon any more. 
2Sam
11:1  And it came to be at the turn of
the year, at the time sovereigns go out to
battle, that Dawiḏ sent Yo’aḇ and his servants with him, and
all Yisra’ĕl, and they destroyed the children of Ammon and besieged
Rabbah. But Dawiḏ remained at Yerushalayim.
2Sam
11:2  And it came to be, at evening time,
that Dawiḏ rose up from his bed and walked about on the roof of the
sovereign’s house. And from the roof he saw a woman bathing, and the woman was
very good to look at. 
2Sam
11:3  And Dawiḏ sent and asked
about the woman, and one said, “Is this not Bathsheḇa, the daughter of
Eliyam, the wife of Uriyah the Ḥittite?” 
2Sam
11:4  And Dawiḏ sent messengers, to
fetch her. And she came to him, and he lay with her – for she was cleansing
herself from her uncleanness – and she returned to her house. 
2Sam
11:5  And the woman conceived, and sent
and informed Dawiḏ, and said, “I am pregnant.” 
2Sam
11:6  Then Dawiḏ sent to Yo’aḇ,
“Send Uriyah the Ḥittite to me.” And Yo’aḇ sent Uriyah to Dawiḏ.

2Sam
11:7  And Uriyah came to him, and Dawiḏ
asked how Yo’aḇ was doing, and how the people were doing, and how the
fighting was going. 
2Sam
11:8  And Dawiḏ said to Uriyah, “Go
down to your house and wash your feet.” And Uriyah went out from the sovereign’s
house, and a gift from the sovereign followed him. 
2Sam
11:9  But Uriyah lay down at the door of
the sovereign’s house with all the servants of his master, and did not go down
to his house. 
2Sam
11:10  And they informed Dawiḏ,
saying, “Uriyah did not go down to his house,” So Dawiḏ said to Uriyah, “Did
you not come from a journey? Why did you not go down to your house?” 
2Sam
11:11  And Uriyah said to Dawiḏ, “The
ark and Yisra’ĕl and Yehuḏah are dwelling in booths, and my master
Yo’aḇ and the servants of my master are encamped in the open fields. And
I, should I go to my house to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? As you
live, and as your being lives, let me not do this.” 
2Sam
11:12  And Dawiḏ said to Uriyah, “Remain
here today also, and tomorrow I let you go.” So Uriyah remained in
Yerushalayim, that day and the next. 
2Sam
11:13  And Dawiḏ called him, and he
ate and drank before him, and he made him drunk. And at evening he went out to
lie on his bed with the servants of his master, but he did not go down to his
house. 
2Sam
11:14  And it came to be in the morning
that Dawiḏ wrote a letter to Yo’aḇ and sent it by the hand of Uriyah.

2Sam
11:15  And he wrote in the letter,
saying, “Set Uriyah in the front of the heaviest battle, and you shall turn
away from him, and he shall be smitten and shall die.” 
2Sam
11:16  And it came to be, as Yo’aḇ
watched the city, that he appointed Uriyah to the place where he knew there
were brave men. 
2Sam
11:17  And the men of the city came out
and fought with Yo’aḇ. And some of the people of the servants of Dawiḏ
fell. And Uriyah the Ḥittite also died. 
2Sam
11:18  And Yo’aḇ sent and reported
to Dawiḏ all the events of the battle, 
2Sam
11:19  and commanded the messenger,
saying, “When you have finished reporting all the events of the battle to the
sovereign, 
2Sam
11:20  then it shall be, if the sovereign’s
wrath rises and he says to you, ‘Why did you go so near to the city when you
fought? Did you not know that they would shoot from the wall? 
2Sam
11:21  ‘Who smote Aḇimeleḵ
the son of Yerubbesheth? Was it not a woman who threw an upper millstone on him
from the wall, so that he died in Thĕḇĕts? Why did you go near
the wall?’ Then you shall say, ‘Your servant Uriyah the Ḥittite is also
dead.’ ” 
2Sam
11:22  And the messenger went, and came
and reported to Dawiḏ all with which Yo’aḇ had sent him. 
2Sam
11:23  And the messenger said to Dawiḏ,
“The men have been mighty against us and came out to us in the field, but we
drove them back as far as the entrance of the gate. 
2Sam
11:24  “And the archers shot from the
wall at your servants. And some of the sovereign’s servants are dead, and your
servant Uriyah the Ḥittite is also dead.”
2Sam
11:25  And Dawiḏ said to the
messenger, “Say to Yo’aḇ, ‘Do not let this matter be evil in your eyes,
for the sword devours one as well as another. Strengthen your attack against
the city, and overthrow it.’ And encourage him.” 
2Sam
11:26  And the wife of Uriyah heard that
Uriyah her husband was dead, and she lamented for her husband. 
2Sam
11:27  And when her mourning was over,
Dawiḏ sent and brought her to his house, and she became his wife and bore
him a son. But the deed that Dawiḏ had done was evil in the eyes of יהוה.
2Sam
12:1  Then יהוה
sent Nathan to Dawiḏ. And he came to him, and said to him, “There were
two men in one city, one rich and the other poor. 
2Sam
12:2  “The rich one had flocks and herds,
very many. 
2Sam
12:3  “But the poor one had only one
little ewe lamb which he had bought and kept alive. And it grew up with him and
with his children together. It ate of his own food and drank from his own cup
and lay in his bosom. And it was like a daughter to him. 
2Sam
12:4  “And a traveller came to the rich
man, who refused to take from his own flock and from his own herd to prepare
one for the wayfaring man who had come to him, but he took the poor man’s lamb
and prepared it for the man who had come to him.”
2Sam
12:5  And the wrath of Dawiḏ burned
greatly against the man, and he said to Nathan, “As יהוה
lives, the man who has done this is a son of death!
2Sam
12:6  “Also, he has to repay fourfold for
the lamb, because he did this deed and because he had no compassion.” 
2Sam
12:7  Then Nathan said to Dawiḏ, “You
are the man! Thus said יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, ‘I
anointed you sovereign over Yisra’ĕl, and I delivered you from the hand of
Sha’ul. 
2Sam
12:8  ‘And I gave you your master’s house
and your master’s wives into your bosom, and gave you the house of Yisra’ĕl
and Yehuḏah. And if that were not enough, I also would have given you
much more! 
2Sam
12:9  ‘Why have you despised the Word of יהוה
to do evil in His eyes? You have killed Uriyah the Ḥittite with the
sword, and his wife you took to be your wife, and you have killed him with the
sword of the children of Ammon. 
2Sam
12:10  ‘And now, the sword does not turn
aside from your house, because you have despised Me, and have taken the wife of
Uriyah the Ḥittite to be your wife.’ 
2Sam
12:11  “Thus said יהוה,
‘See, I am raising up evil against you, from your own house, and shall take
your wives before your eyes and give them to your neighbour, and he shall lie
with your wives in the sight of this sun. 
2Sam
12:12  ‘For you did it in secret, but I
shall do this deed before all Yisra’ĕl, and before the sun.’ ” 
2Sam
12:13  And Dawiḏ said to Nathan, “I
have sinned against יהוה.” And Nathan said to Dawiḏ,
“Also, יהוה has put away your sin, you shall not die. 
2Sam
12:14  “However, because by this deed you
have greatly scorned יהוה, the child also who is born
to you shall certainly die.” 
2Sam
12:15  And Nathan went to his house, and יהוה
smote the child that Uriyah’s wife had born to Dawiḏ, and he was sick. 
2Sam
12:16  And Dawiḏ sought Elohim for
the child, and Dawiḏ fasted and went in and spent all night lying on the
ground. 
2Sam
12:17  So the elders of his house stood
up over him, to raise him up from the earth. But he would not, nor did he eat
food with them. 
2Sam
12:18  And on the seventh day it came to
be that the child died. And the servants of Dawiḏ were afraid to inform
him that the child was dead, for they said, “Look, while the child was still
alive, we spoke to him, and he would not listen to our voice. And how do we say
to him that the child is dead? Then he shall do evil!” 
2Sam
12:19  And Dawiḏ saw that his
servants were whispering, and Dawiḏ perceived that the child was dead.
Then Dawiḏ said to his servants, “Is the child dead?” And they said, “He
is dead.” 
2Sam
12:20  Dawiḏ then rose up from the
ground, and washed and anointed himself, and changed his garments. And he went
into the House of יהוה and bowed himself, then came to
his own house, and asked, and they set food before him, so he ate. 
2Sam
12:21  And his servants said to him, “What
is this that you have done? You fasted and wept because of the living child,
but when the child died, you rose up and ate food.” 
2Sam
12:22  And he said, “While the child was
alive I fasted and wept, for I said, ‘Who knows whether יהוה
shows favour unto me, and the child shall live?’ 
2Sam
12:23  “But now he is dead, why should I
fast? Am I able to bring him back again? I am going to him, but he does not
return to me.” 
2Sam
12:24  And Dawiḏ comforted Bathsheḇa
his wife, and went in to her and lay with her. So she bore a son, and he called
his name Shelomoh. And יהוה loved him, 
2Sam
12:25  and sent by the hand of Nathan the
prophet, and called his name Yeḏiḏeyah, because of יהוה.

2Sam
12:26  And Yo’aḇ fought against
Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and captured the royal city. 
2Sam
12:27  And Yo’aḇ sent messengers to
Dawiḏ, and said, “I have fought against Rabbah, and I have captured the
city’s water supply. 
2Sam
12:28  “And now, gather the rest of the
people together and encamp against the city and capture it, lest I capture the
city and it be called after my name.” 
2Sam
12:29  And Dawiḏ gathered all the
people and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and captured it. 
2Sam
12:30  And he took their sovereign’s
crown from his head. And its weight was a talent of gold, with precious stones,
and it was on Dawiḏ’s head. And he brought out the spoil of the city, a
very great amount. 
2Sam
12:31  And he brought out the people who
were in it, and set them to the saw and to sharp instruments of iron and to
axes of iron, and made them pass over to the brick works. And so he did with
all the cities of the children of Ammon. And Dawiḏ and all the people
returned to Yerushalayim. 
2Sam
13:1  And after this it came to be that Aḇshalom
son of Dawiḏ had a lovely sister, whose name was Tamar, and Amnon son of
Dawiḏ loved her. 
2Sam
13:2  And Amnon was distressed, even to
become sick, because of his sister Tamar – for she was a maiden – and it was
hard in the eyes of Amnon to do whatever to her. 
2Sam
13:3  And Amnon had a friend whose name
was Yonaḏaḇ son of Shim‛ah, Dawiḏ’s brother. Now Yonaḏaḇ
was a very wise man. 
2Sam
13:4  And he said to him, “Why are you,
the sovereign’s son, becoming thinner day after day? Explain it to me.” And
Amnon said to him, “I love Tamar, my brother Aḇshalom’s sister.” 
2Sam
13:5  And Yonaḏaḇ said to
him, “Lie down on your bed and pretend to be sick. And when your father comes
to see you, say to him, ‘Please let my sister Tamar come and give me food, and
make the food before my eyes so that I see it, and eat it from her hand.’ ”  
2Sam
13:6  So Amnon lay down and pretended to
be sick. And when the sovereign came to see him, Amnon said to the sovereign, “Please
let Tamar my sister come and make a couple of cakes for me before my eyes, so
that I eat from her hand.” 
2Sam
13:7  And Dawiḏ sent to Tamar, to
the house, saying, “Please go to the house of your brother Amnon, and make food
for him.” 
2Sam
13:8  So Tamar went to her brother Amnon’s
house, while he was lying down. And she took dough and kneaded it, and made
cakes before his eyes, and baked the cakes. 
2Sam
13:9  And she took the pan and turned
them out before him, but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, “Make everyone go
away from me.” And they all went out from him. 
2Sam
13:10  And Amnon said to Tamar, “Bring
the food into the bedroom, that I eat from your hand.” And Tamar took the cakes
which she had made, and brought them to Amnon her brother in the bedroom. 
2Sam
13:11  And she brought them to him to
eat, and he took hold of her and said to her, “Come, lie with me, my sister.” 
2Sam
13:12  And she answered him, “No, my
brother, do not humble me, for it is not done so in Yisra’ĕl. Do not do
this wickedness! 
2Sam
13:13  “And I, where could I take my
shame? And you – you would be like one of the fools in Yisra’ĕl. And now,
please speak to the sovereign, for he would not withhold me from you.” 
2Sam
13:14  But he would not listen to her
voice, and being stronger than she, he humbled her and lay with her. 
2Sam
13:15  Amnon then hated her exceedingly,
so that the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which
he had loved her. And Amnon said to her, “Arise, go!” 
2Sam
13:16  And she said to him, “No, for this
evil of sending me away is worse than the other you have done to me.” But he
would not listen to her. 
2Sam
13:17  And he called his young man
serving him, and said, “Now put this one out, away from me, and bolt the door
behind her.” 
2Sam
13:18  And she had on a long coat, for
the sovereign’s maiden daughters wore such garments. And his servant put her
out and bolted the door behind her. 
2Sam
13:19  And Tamar put ashes on her head,
and tore her long coat that was on her, and put her hand on her head and went
away crying bitterly. 
2Sam
13:20  And Aḇshalom her brother
said to her, “Has Amnon your brother been with you? But now, keep silent, my
sister. He is your brother, do not take this matter to heart.” So Tamar
remained in the house of her brother Aḇshalom, but was ruined. 
2Sam
13:21  And Sovereign Dawiḏ heard
all these reports, and he was very wroth. 
2Sam
13:22  And Aḇshalom spoke to his
brother Amnon neither good nor evil. For Aḇshalom hated Amnon, because he
had humbled his sister Tamar. 
2Sam
13:23  And it came to be, after two
years, that Aḇshalom had sheep-shearers in Ba‛al Hatsor, which is
beside Ephrayim, and Aḇshalom invited all the sons of the sovereign. 
2Sam
13:24  And Aḇshalom came to the
sovereign and said, “See, your servant has sheep-shearers. Please, let the
sovereign and his servants go with your servant.” 
2Sam
13:25  But the sovereign said to Aḇshalom,
“No, my son, let us not all go now, lest we be too heavy on you.” And he urged
him, but he would not go. And he blessed him. 
2Sam
13:26  And Aḇshalom said, “If not,
please let my brother Amnon go with us.” And the sovereign said to him, “Why
should he go with you?” 
2Sam
13:27  And Aḇshalom urged him, so
he let Amnon and all the sons of the sovereign go with him. 
2Sam
13:28  And Aḇshalom had commanded
his servants, saying, “Watch, and when the heart of Amnon is glad with wine,
and I shall say to you, ‘Smite Amnon!’ then kill him. Do not be afraid. Have I
not commanded you? Be strong and brave.” 
2Sam
13:29  Then the servants of Aḇshalom
did to Amnon as Aḇshalom had commanded. Then all the sons of the
sovereign rose up, and each one mounted his mule and fled. 
2Sam
13:30  And it came to be, while they were
on the way, that news came to Dawiḏ, saying, “Aḇshalom has smitten
all the sons of the sovereign, and not one of them is left!” 
2Sam
13:31  And the sovereign rose up and tore
his garments and lay on the ground, and all his servants stood by with their
garments torn. 
2Sam
13:32  And Yonaḏaḇ son of
Shim‛ah, Dawiḏ’s brother, answered and said, “Do not let my master
say they have killed all the young men, the sons of the sovereign, for only
Amnon is dead. For by the command of Aḇshalom this has been appointed
from the day that he humbled his sister Tamar. 
2Sam
13:33  “And now, let not my master the sovereign
take the matter to his heart, to think that all the sons of the sovereign are
dead. For only Amnon is dead.” 
2Sam
13:34  And Aḇshalom fled, and the
young man who was watching lifted up his eyes and looked and saw many people
were coming from the way behind him, on the side of the hill. 
2Sam
13:35  Then Yonaḏaḇ said to
the sovereign, “Look, the sons of the sovereign are coming; as your servant
said, so it is.” 
2Sam
13:36  And it came to be, as soon as he
had finished speaking, that look, the sons of the sovereign came, and they
lifted up their voice and wept. And the sovereign too, and all his servants
wept very bitterly. 
2Sam
13:37  But Aḇshalom fled and went
to Talmai son of Ammihuḏ, sovereign of Geshur. And Dawiḏ mourned for his son all the days. 
2Sam
13:38  So Aḇshalom fled and went to
Geshur, and was there three years. 
2Sam
13:39  Sovereign Dawiḏ then longed
to go to Aḇshalom, for he had been comforted concerning Amnon, because he
was dead. 
2Sam
14:1  And Yo’aḇ son of Tseruyah
knew that the heart of the sovereign was towards Aḇshalom. 
2Sam
14:2  And Yo’aḇ sent to Teqowa and
brought from there a wise woman, and said to her, “Please pretend to be a
mourner, and put on mourning garments, and do not anoint yourself with oil, but
act like a woman who has been mourning a long time for the dead. 
2Sam
14:3  “Then you shall go to the sovereign
and speak to him according to this word.” And Yo’aḇ put the words in her
mouth. 
2Sam
14:4  And when the woman of Teqowa spoke
to the sovereign, she fell on her face to the ground and did obeisance, and
said, “Save, O sovereign!” 
2Sam
14:5  And the sovereign said to her, “What
is your trouble?” And she answered, “Truly I am a widow, my husband is dead. 
2Sam
14:6  “And your female servant had two
sons. And the two fought with each other in the field, and there was no one to
part them, but the one smote the other and killed him. 
2Sam
14:7  “And see, the entire clan has risen
up against your female servant and said, ‘Give him who smote his brother, so
that we put him to death for the life of his brother whom he killed, and
destroy the heir also.’ Thus they would extinguish my burning coal that is
left, and leave to my husband neither name nor remnant on the earth.” 
2Sam
14:8  And the sovereign said to the
woman, “Go to your house, and let me give orders concerning you.” 
2Sam
14:9  And the woman of Teqowa said to the
sovereign, “My master, O sovereign, let the crookedness be on me and on my father’s
house, and the sovereign and his throne be guiltless.” 
2Sam
14:10  And the sovereign said, “Whoever
speaks to you, bring him to me, and let him no longer touch you.” 
2Sam
14:11  And she said, “Please let the
sovereign remember יהוה your Elohim, and the redeemer
of blood not destroy any more, lest they destroy my son.” And he said, “As יהוה
lives, not one hair of your son shall fall to the ground.” 
2Sam
14:12  And the woman said, “Please, let
your female servant speak a word to my master the sovereign.” And he said, “Speak.”

2Sam
14:13  And the woman said, “And why have
you reasoned like this against the people of Elohim? For in speaking this word
the sovereign is as one who is guilty, in that the sovereign does not bring his
outcast one home again. 
2Sam
14:14  “For we shall certainly die and
become like water spilled on the ground, which is not gathered up again. Yet
Elohim does not take away a life, but shall devise ways, so that His outcast
ones are not cast out from Him. 
2Sam
14:15  “And now I have come to speak this
word to my master the sovereign because the people have made me afraid. And
your female servant said, ‘Please let me speak to the sovereign, it could be
that the sovereign does what his female servant asks, 
2Sam
14:16  for the sovereign has listened to
deliver his female servant from the hand of the man seeking to destroy me and my son together from the inheritance of
Elohim.’ 
2Sam
14:17  “Then your female servant said, ‘Please
let the word of my master the sovereign be comforting, for my master the
sovereign is as the messenger of Elohim, in discerning the good and the evil.
And יהוה your Elohim is with you.’ ” 
2Sam
14:18  And the sovereign answered and
said to the woman, “Please do not hide from me the matter that I am asking you.”
And the woman said, “Please, let my master the sovereign speak.” 
2Sam
14:19  And the sovereign said, “Is the
hand of Yo’aḇ with you in all this?” And the woman answered and said, “As
your being lives, my master the sovereign, no one turns to the right or to the left from all that my master the
sovereign has spoken. For your servant Yo’aḇ commanded me, and he put all
these words in the mouth of your female servant. 
2Sam
14:20  “Your servant Yo’aḇ has done
this to change the appearance of the matter. But my master is wise, according
to the wisdom of a messenger of Elohim, to know all that is in the earth.” 
2Sam
14:21  And the sovereign said to Yo’aḇ,
“See now, you shall do this matter. And go, bring back the young man Aḇshalom.”

2Sam
14:22  And Yo’aḇ fell to the ground
on his face and did obeisance, and blessed the sovereign. And Yo’aḇ said,
“Today your servant knows that I have found favour in your eyes, my master, O
sovereign, in that the sovereign has done the word of his servant.” 
2Sam
14:23  And Yo’aḇ rose up and went
to Geshur, and brought Aḇshalom to Yerushalayim. 
2Sam
14:24  And the sovereign said, “Let him
return to his own house, but do not let him see my face.” And Aḇshalom
went to his own house, and did not see the sovereign’s face. 
2Sam
14:25  And in all Yisra’ĕl there was
no one who was praised as much as Aḇshalom for his good looks. From the
sole of his foot to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him. 
2Sam
14:26  And when he cut the hair of his
head – for it was at every year’s end that he cut it because it was heavy on
him – when he cut it, he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred sheqels by
the sovereign’s weight. 
2Sam
14:27  And to Aḇshalom were born
three sons, and one daughter whose name was Tamar. She was a woman of fair
appearance. 
2Sam
14:28  And Aḇshalom dwelt in
Yerushalayim, two years, and he had not seen the sovereign’s face. 
2Sam
14:29  Then Aḇshalom sent for Yo’aḇ,
to send him to the sovereign, but he would not come to him. And he sent again
the second time, but he would not come. 
2Sam
14:30  And he said to his servants, “See,
Yo’aḇ’s field is near mine, and he has barley there. Go and set it on
fire.” And Aḇshalom’s servants set the field on fire. 
2Sam
14:31  Then Yo’aḇ rose up and came
to the house of Aḇshalom, and said to him, “Why have your servants set my
field on fire?” 
2Sam
14:32  And Aḇshalom said to Yo’aḇ,
“Look, I sent to you, saying, ‘Come here, so that I send you to the sovereign,
to say, “Why have I come from Geshur? It was good for me while I was there.” ’
And now, let me see the sovereign’s face. And if there is any crookedness in
me, then you shall put me to death.” 
2Sam
14:33  Yo’aḇ then went to the
sovereign and informed him. And he called for Aḇshalom, and he came to
the sovereign and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the sovereign.
Then the sovereign kissed Aḇshalom. 
2Sam
15:1  And it came to be after this that Aḇshalom
prepared a chariot and horses for himself, and fifty men to run before him. 
2Sam
15:2  And Aḇshalom used to rise
early and stand beside the way to the gate. And it came to be, whenever anyone
who had a complaint came to the sovereign for a right-ruling, that Aḇshalom
would call to him and say, “What city are you from?” And when he said, “Your
servant is from such and such a tribe of Yisra’ĕl,” 
2Sam
15:3  Aḇshalom would say to him, “Look,
your matters are good and right, but you have nobody from the sovereign to hear
you.” 
2Sam
15:4  And Aḇshalom would say, “Oh,
that I were made judge in the land, and everyone who has any complaint or case
would come to me, and I shall let right be done to him.” 
2Sam
15:5  And it came to be, whenever anyone
came near him to bow down to him, that he would put out his hand and take him
and kiss him. 
2Sam
15:6  And Aḇshalom did this to all
Yisra’ĕl who came to the sovereign for right-ruling. And Aḇshalom
stole the hearts of the men of Yisra’ĕl. 
2Sam
15:7  And it came to be at the end of
four years that Aḇshalom said to the sovereign, “Please, let me go to Ḥeḇron
and pay the vow which I vowed to יהוה. 
2Sam
15:8  “For your servant vowed a vow while
I dwelt at Geshur in Aram, saying, ‘If יהוה indeed
brings me back to Yerushalayim, then I shall serve יהוה.’
” 
2Sam
15:9  And the sovereign said to him, “Go
in peace.” And he rose up and went to Ḥeḇron. 
2Sam
15:10  But Aḇshalom sent spies
throughout all the tribes of Yisra’ĕl, saying, “As soon as you hear the
sound of the ram’s horn, then you shall say, ‘Aḇshalom is sovereign in Ḥeḇron!’
” 
2Sam
15:11  And with Aḇshalom went two
hundred men from Yerushalayim who were invited, and they went along
unsuspectingly, and did not know the matter at all. 
2Sam
15:12  Aḇshalom also sent for
Aḥithophel the Gilonite, counsellor of Dawiḏ, from his city, from
Giloh, while he was bringing offerings. And it came to be that the conspiracy
became strong, for the people with Aḇshalom kept increasing. 
2Sam
15:13  Then a messenger came to Dawiḏ,
saying, “The hearts of the men of Yisra’ĕl are with Aḇshalom.” 
2Sam
15:14  And Dawiḏ said to all his servants
who were with him at Yerushalayim, “Rise up, and let us flee, for none of us
shall escape from Aḇshalom. Go in haste, lest he overtake us quickly and
bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.”  
2Sam
15:15  And the sovereign’s servants said
to the sovereign, “Look, your servants shall
do according to all my master the sovereign chooses.” 
2Sam
15:16  And the sovereign went out, and
all his household at his feet. But the sovereign left ten women, concubines, to
look after the house.
2Sam
15:17  So the sovereign went out, and all
the people at his feet, and they stood still at the last house. 
2Sam
15:18  And all his servants were passing
on at his side. And all the Kerĕthites, and all the Pelĕthites, and
all the Gittites, six hundred men who had followed him from Gath, were passing
on before the sovereign. 
2Sam
15:19  And the sovereign said to Ittai
the Gittite, “Why do you go, you also, with us? Turn back and remain with the
sovereign, for you are a foreigner, and also an exile from your own place. 
2Sam
15:20  “You came yesterday, and should I
today make you wander up and down with us, when I am going wherever I am going?
Return, and take your brothers back. Kindness and truth be with you.” 
2Sam
15:21  And Ittai answered the sovereign
and said, “As יהוה lives, and as my master the
sovereign lives, in whatever place my master the sovereign is, whether in death
or life, let your servant also be there.”
2Sam
15:22  Therefore Dawiḏ said to
Ittai, “Go, and pass over.” And Ittai the Gittite and all his men and all the
little ones who were with him passed over. 
2Sam
15:23  And all the land was weeping with
a loud voice, and all the people were passing over. And the sovereign himself
was passing over the wadi Qiḏron, and all the people were passing over
toward the way of the wilderness.
2Sam
15:24  And see, Tsaḏoq also came, and all the Lĕwites with him,
bearing the ark of the covenant of Elohim. And they set down the ark of Elohim,
and Eḇyathar went up until all the people completed passing over from the
city. 
2Sam
15:25  And the sovereign said to Tsaḏoq,
“Take the ark of Elohim back to the city. If I find favour in the eyes of יהוה,
then He shall bring me back and show me both it and His dwelling.
2Sam
15:26  “But if He says thus, ‘I have not
delighted in you,’ here I am, let Him do to me as seems good in His eyes.” 
2Sam
15:27  And the sovereign said to Tsaḏoq
the priest, “Are you not a seer? Return to the city in peace, and your two sons
with you, Aḥima‛ats your son, and Yehonathan son of Eḇyathar.

2Sam
15:28  “See, I am waiting in the desert
plains of the wilderness until word comes from you to inform me.” 
2Sam
15:29  And Tsaḏoq and Eḇyathar
took the ark of Elohim back to Yerushalayim, and they remained there. 
2Sam
15:30  And Dawiḏ went up by the
ascent of the Mount of Olives, and
wept as he went up. And he had his head covered and went barefoot. And all the
people who were with him covered their heads and went up, weeping as they went
up. 
2Sam
15:31  And Dawiḏ was informed,
saying, “Aḥithophel is among the conspirators with Aḇshalom.” And
Dawiḏ said, “O יהוה, I pray You, make the counsel
of Aḥithophel foolish!” 
2Sam
15:32  And it came to be that Dawiḏ
came to the summit, where he bowed himself before Elohim, and saw Ḥushai
the Arkite, coming to meet him with
his robe torn and dust on his head. 
2Sam
15:33  And Dawiḏ said to him, “If
you pass on with me, then you shall become a burden to me, 
2Sam
15:34  but if you return to the city, and
say to Aḇshalom, ‘I am your servant, O sovereign – once servant of your
father, but now I am your servant,’ then you shall nullify the counsel of
Aḥithophel for me. 
2Sam
15:35  “And are not Tsaḏoq and Eḇyathar
the priests with you there? And it shall be that every matter you hear from the
sovereign’s house, you should report to Tsaḏoq and Eḇyathar the
priests. 
2Sam
15:36  “See, there with them are their
two sons, Aḥima‛ats, Tsaḏoq’s son, and Yehonathan, Eḇyathar’s
son. And by them you shall send me every matter you hear.” 
2Sam
15:37  And Ḥushai, Dawiḏ’s
friend, went into the city. And Aḇshalom came into Yerushalayim. 
2Sam
16:1  And Dawiḏ had passed on a
little from the summit, and saw Tsiḇa the servant of Mephiḇosheth,
who met him with a couple of saddled donkeys, and on them two hundred loaves,
and one hundred cakes of raisins, and one hundred summer fruit, and a skin of
wine. 
2Sam
16:2  And the sovereign said to Tsiḇa,
“Why do you have these?” And Tsiḇa said, “The donkeys are for the sovereign’s
household to ride on, and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat,
and the wine for the wearied to drink in the wilderness.” 
2Sam
16:3  And the sovereign said, “And where
is the son of your master?” And Tsiḇa said to the sovereign, “See, he
remains in Yerushalayim, for he said, ‘Today the house of Yisra’ĕl is
going to return the reign of my father to me.’ ” 
2Sam
16:4  And the sovereign said to Tsiḇa,
“See, all that belongs to Mephiḇosheth is yours.” And Tsiḇa said, “I
have bowed myself, let me find favour in your eyes, my master, O sovereign!”
2Sam
16:5  And when Sovereign Dawiḏ came
to Baḥurim he saw a man from the clan of the house of Sha’ul, whose name
was Shim‛i son of Gĕra, coming from there. He came out, cursing as
he came. 
2Sam
16:6  And he threw Dawiḏ with
stones, and all the servants of Sovereign Dawiḏ. And all the people and
all the mighty men were on his right and on his left. 
2Sam
16:7  And this is what Shim‛i said
as he cursed, “Get out! Get out! O man of blood, and man of Beliya‛al! 
2Sam
16:8  “ יהוה has
brought upon you all the blood of the house of Sha’ul, in whose place you have
reigned. And יהוה has given the reign into the hand of
Aḇshalom your son. And see, you are in your own evil, for you are a man
of blood!” 
2Sam
16:9  And Aḇishai son of Tseruyah
said to the sovereign, “Why should this dead dog curse my master the sovereign?
Please, let me pass over and take off his head!” 
2Sam
16:10  And the sovereign said, “What have
I to do with you, you sons of Tseruyah? For let him curse, even because יהוה
has said to him, ‘Curse Dawiḏ.’ And who should say, ‘Why did you do that?’
” 
2Sam
16:11  And Dawiḏ said to Aḇishai
and all his servants, “See how my son who came from my own body seeks my life,
and how much more now this Binyamite? Leave him alone, and let him curse, for יהוה
has spoken to him. 
2Sam
16:12  “If so be, יהוה
does look on my affliction, and יהוה shall return good
to me for his cursing today.” 
2Sam
16:13  And as Dawiḏ and his men
went in the way, Shim‛i walked alongside him on the hillside, and cursed
as he went, and threw stones at him and kicked up dust. 
2Sam
16:14  And the sovereign and all the
people who were with him became weary, and they refreshed themselves there. 
2Sam
16:15  And Aḇshalom and all the
people, the men of Yisra’ĕl, came to Yerushalayim, and Aḥithophel
was with him. 
2Sam
16:16  And it came to be, when Ḥushai
the Arkite, the friend of Dawiḏ, had come to Aḇshalom, that Ḥushai
said to Aḇshalom, “Let the sovereign live! Let the sovereign live!” 
2Sam
16:17  And Aḇshalom said to Ḥushai,
“Is this your kindness to your friend? Why did you not go with your friend?” 
2Sam
16:18  And Ḥushai said to Aḇshalom,
“No, I am for the one whom יהוה and this people and all
the men of Yisra’ĕl have chosen, and with him I remain. 
2Sam
16:19  “And besides, whom should I serve?
Should it not be before his son? As I have served before your father, so I am
before you.” 
2Sam
16:20  And Aḇshalom said to
Aḥithophel, “Give your advice. What should we do?” 
2Sam
16:21  And Aḥithophel said to Aḇshalom,
“Go in to your father’s concubines, whom he has left to look after the house.
And all Yisra’ĕl shall hear that you have made yourself a stench to your
father. And the hands of all who are with you shall be strong.” 
2Sam
16:22  So they pitched a tent for Aḇshalom
on the top of the house, and Aḇshalom went in to his father’s concubines
before the eyes of all Yisra’ĕl. 
2Sam
16:23  Now the advice Aḥithophel
gave in those days was as if one had inquired at the word of Elohim. So was all
the advice of Aḥithophel both to Dawiḏ and to Aḇshalom. 
2Sam
17:1  And Aḥithophel said to Aḇshalom,
“Please let me choose twelve thousand men, and let me arise and pursue Dawiḏ
tonight, 
2Sam
17:2  and come upon him while he is weary
and weak. And I shall make him afraid and all the people who are with him shall
flee. And I shall smite the sovereign alone, 
2Sam
17:3  and bring back all the people to
you. When all return except the man whom you seek, all the people should be at
peace.” 
2Sam
17:4  And the saying pleased Aḇshalom
and all the elders of Yisra’ĕl. 
2Sam
17:5  But Aḇshalom said, “Now call Ḥushai
the Arkite also, and let us hear what he says too.” 
2Sam
17:6  And Ḥushai came to Aḇshalom,
and Aḇshalom spoke to him, saying, “Aḥithophel has spoken according
to this word. Should we do as he says? If not, speak up.” 
2Sam
17:7  And Ḥushai said to Aḇshalom,
“The advice that Aḥithophel has given is not good at this time.” 
2Sam
17:8  And Ḥushai said, “You know
your father and his men, that they are mighty men, and they are as bitter in
being as a bear robbed of her cubs in the field. And your father is a man of
battle, and would not spend the night with the people. 
2Sam
17:9  “See, by now he is hidden in some
pit, or in some place. And it shall be, when some of them fall at the first,
that whoever hears it shall say, ‘There has been a slaughter among the people
who are following Aḇshalom.’ 
2Sam
17:10  “And even he who is brave, whose
heart is like the heart of a lion, would utterly melt. For all Yisra’ĕl
knows that your father is a mighty man, and those who are with him are brave
men. 
2Sam
17:11  “But I advise: Let all Yisra’ĕl
without fail be gathered to you, from Dan to Be’ĕrsheḇa, as numerous
as the sand by the sea, and that you yourself go to battle. 
2Sam
17:12  “And we shall come upon him in
some place where he is found, and fall on him as the dew falls on the ground.
And there shall be left of him and of all the men with him not even one. 
2Sam
17:13  “And if he withdraws into a city,
then all Yisra’ĕl shall bring ropes to that city. And we shall pull it
into the wadi, until there is not one small stone found there.” 
2Sam
17:14  Aḇshalom and all the men of
Yisra’ĕl then said, “The advice of Ḥushai the Arkite is better than
the advice of Aḥithophel.” For יהוה had ordained
to nullify the good advice of Aḥithophel, for the sake of יהוה
bringing evil upon Aḇshalom. 
2Sam
17:15  Ḥushai then said to Tsaḏoq
and to Eḇyathar the priests, “Aḥithophel has advised Aḇshalom
and the elders of Yisra’ĕl such and such, but I have advised so and so. 
2Sam
17:16  “And now, send hastily and inform
Dawiḏ, saying, ‘Do not spend this night in the desert plains of the
wilderness, but pass over without fail, lest the sovereign and all the people
with him be swallowed up.’ ” 
2Sam
17:17  And Yehonathan and Aḥima‛ats
were stationed at Ĕn Roḡĕl, and a female servant would come and
inform them, and they would go and inform Sovereign Dawiḏ, for they could
not be seen entering the city. 
2Sam
17:18  But a youth saw them, and informed
Aḇshalom. So the two of them went away at once and came to a man’s house
in Baḥurim, who had a well in his courtyard, and they went down into it. 
2Sam
17:19  And the woman took and spread a
covering over the well’s mouth, and spread ground grain on it, so the matter
was not known. 
2Sam
17:20  And the servants of Aḇshalom
came to the woman at the house and said, “Where are Aḥima‛ats and
Yehonathan?” And the woman said to them, “They have passed over the stream of water.”
And they looked and did not find them, and returned to Yerushalayim. 
2Sam
17:21  And it came to be, after they had
left, that they came up out of the well and went and informed Sovereign Dawiḏ,
and said to Dawiḏ, “Arise and pass over the water quickly. For thus
Aḥithophel has advised against you.” 
2Sam
17:22  And Dawiḏ and all the people
who were with him rose up and passed over the Yardĕn. And by morning light
not even one remained who had not gone over the Yardĕn. 
2Sam
17:23  And Aḥithophel saw that his
advice was not followed, so he saddled his donkey, and rose up and went home to
his house, to his city. Then he gave charge to his house, and hanged himself,
and died. And he was buried in his father’s tomb. 
2Sam
17:24  And Dawiḏ came to Maḥanayim.
And Aḇshalom passed over the Yardĕn, he and all the men of Yisra’ĕl
with him. 
2Sam
17:25  And Aḇshalom appointed Amasa
over the army instead of Yo’aḇ. Now Amasa was the son of a man whose name
was Yithra, an Yisra’ĕlite, who had gone in to Aḇiḡayil the
daughter of Naḥash, sister of Tseruyah, Yo’aḇ’s mother.
2Sam
17:26  And Yisra’ĕl and Aḇshalom
encamped in the land of Gil‛aḏ. 
2Sam
17:27  And it came to be, when Dawiḏ
had come to Maḥanayim, that Shoḇi son of Naḥash from Rabbah
of the children of Ammon, and Maḵir son of Ammi’ĕl from Lo Ḏeḇar,
and Barzillai the Gil‛aḏite from Roḡelim, 
2Sam
17:28  brought beds and basins, and
earthen vessels and wheat, and barley and flour, and roasted grain and beans, and lentils, and
parched vegetables, 
2Sam
17:29  and honey and curds, and sheep and
cheese of the herd, for Dawiḏ and the people who were with him to eat.
For they said, “The people are hungry and weary and thirsty in the wilderness.”

2Sam
18:1  And Dawiḏ mustered the people
who were with him, and set commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds
over them. 
2Sam
18:2  And Dawiḏ sent out one third
of the people under the hand of Yo’aḇ, and one third under the hand of Aḇishai
son of Tseruyah, Yo’aḇ’s brother, and one third under the hand of Ittai
the Gittite. And the sovereign said to the people, “I shall certainly go out
with you too.” 
2Sam
18:3  But the people answered, “Do not go
out, for if we flee away, they would not set heart upon us. Even if half of us
die, they would not set heart upon us. For now, ten thousand are like us.
Therefore, it is better for you to support us from the city.” 
2Sam
18:4  And the sovereign said to them, “That
which is good in your eyes I do.” And the sovereign stood beside the gate, and
all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands.
2Sam
18:5  And the sovereign ordered Yo’aḇ,
and Aḇishai and Ittai, saying, “Be gentle with the young man Aḇshalom
for my sake.” And all the people heard when the sovereign gave all the
commanders orders concerning Aḇshalom. 
2Sam
18:6  So the people went out into the
field to meet Yisra’ĕl. And the battle was in the forest of Ephrayim, 
2Sam
18:7  and the people of Yisra’ĕl
were smitten there before the servants of Dawiḏ. And the slaughter there
that day was great – twenty thousand. 
2Sam
18:8  And the battle there was scattered
over the face of all the land, and the forest devoured more people that day
than the sword devoured. 
2Sam
18:9  And when Aḇshalom met the
servants of Dawiḏ, Aḇshalom was riding on a mule, and the mule went
under the thick branches of a great terebinth tree, and his head caught in the
terebinth. And he was suspended between the heavens and earth while the mule
which was under him passed on.
2Sam
18:10  And a certain man saw it and
informed Yo’aḇ, and said, “Look, I saw Aḇshalom hanging in a
terebinth tree!” 
2Sam
18:11  And Yo’aḇ said to the man
who informed him, “Now look, you saw, and why did you not smite him to the
earth there? Then I would have given you ten pieces of silver and a belt.” 
2Sam
18:12  But the man answered Yo’aḇ, “Though
I were to receive a thousand pieces of silver in my hand, I would not raise my
hand against the son of the sovereign. Because in our hearing the sovereign
ordered you and Aḇishai and Ittai, saying, ‘Take heed, you who go against
the youth, against Aḇshalom!’ 
2Sam
18:13  “Otherwise I would have been
untrue to my own life. For no matter is hidden from the sovereign, and you
yourself would have set yourself against me.” 
2Sam
18:14  And Yo’aḇ said, “Let me not
waste time here with you.” And he took three spears in his hand and thrust them
through Aḇshalom’s heart, while he was still alive in the midst of the
terebinth tree. 
2Sam
18:15  And ten young men who bore Yo’aḇ’s
armour went around, and smote Aḇshalom and put him to death. 
2Sam
18:16  And Yo’aḇ blew the ram’s
horn, and the people returned from pursuing Yisra’ĕl, for Yo’aḇ had
held the people back. 
2Sam
18:17  And they took Aḇshalom and
threw him into a large pit in the forest, and heaped a very large pile of
stones over him. And all Yisra’ĕl fled, each one to his tent. 
2Sam
18:18  And Aḇshalom in his lifetime
had taken and set up a monument for himself, which is in the Sovereign’s
Valley. For he said, “I have no son to keep my name in remembrance.” And he
called the monument after his own name. And to this day it is called Aḇshalom’s
Monument. 
2Sam
18:19  And Aḥima‛ats son of
Tsaḏoq said, “Please let me run and take the news to the sovereign, for יהוה
has avenged him of his enemies.” 
2Sam
18:20  But Yo’aḇ said to him, “You
are not the man to take the news today, but you shall take the news another
day. But today you do not take news, because the sovereign’s son is dead.” 
2Sam
18:21  And Yo’aḇ said to the
Kushite, “Go, inform the sovereign what you have seen.” And the Kushite bowed
himself to Yo’aḇ and ran. 
2Sam
18:22  And Aḥima‛ats son of
Tsaḏoq said again to Yo’aḇ, “And whatever might be, please let me
also run after the Kushite.” And Yo’aḇ said, “Why would you run, my son,
there is no news to bring you reward.” 
2Sam
18:23  “And whatever might be,” he said, “let me run.” So he said to
him, “Run.” And Aḥima‛ats ran by the way of the plain, and passed
the Kushite. 
2Sam
18:24  Now Dawiḏ was sitting
between the two gates. And the watchman went up to the roof over the gate, to
the wall, and lifted his eyes and looked and saw a man, running alone. 
2Sam
18:25  So the watchman called out and
told the sovereign. And the sovereign said, “If he is alone, there is news in
his mouth.” And he came nearer and nearer.
2Sam
18:26  And the watchman saw another man
running, and the watchman called out to the gatekeeper and said, “See, a man,
running by himself!” And the sovereign said, “This one is also bringing news.” 
2Sam
18:27  And the watchman said, “I see the
running of the first is like the running of Aḥima‛ats son of Tsaḏoq.”
And the sovereign said, “This is a good man, and he comes with good news.” 
2Sam
18:28  And Aḥima‛ats called
out and said to the sovereign, “Peace!” Then he bowed down with his face to the
earth before the sovereign, and said, “Blessed be יהוה
your Elohim, who has surrendered the men who raised their hand against my
master the sovereign!” 
2Sam
18:29  And the sovereign said, “Peace to
the young man, to Aḇshalom?” And Aḥima‛ats answered, “When Yo’aḇ
sent the sovereign’s servant and me your servant, I saw a great crowd, but I
did not know why.” 
2Sam
18:30  And the sovereign said, “Turn
aside and stand here.” And he turned aside and stood still. 
2Sam
18:31  And see, the Kushite came, and the
Kushite said, “Receive news, my master the sovereign! For יהוה
has avenged you this day of all those who rose against you.” 
2Sam
18:32  And the sovereign said to the
Kushite, “Peace to the young man, to Aḇshalom?” And the Kushite answered,
“Let the enemies of my master the sovereign, and all who rise against you for
evil, be as that young man is!” 
2Sam
18:33  And the sovereign was shaken, and
went up to the room over the gate, and wept. And as he went, he said this, “O
my son Aḇshalom! My son, my son Aḇshalom, if only I had died
instead of you! O Aḇshalom my son, my son!” 
2Sam
19:1  And it was reported to Yo’aḇ,
“See, the sovereign is weeping and mourning for Aḇshalom.” 
2Sam
19:2  So the deliverance that day was
turned into mourning for all the people. For the people heard on that day,
saying, “The sovereign has been grieved for his son.” 
2Sam
19:3  And the people stole back into the
city that day, as people who are ashamed steal away when they flee in battle. 
2Sam
19:4  And the sovereign covered his face,
and the sovereign cried out with a loud voice, “O my son Aḇshalom! O Aḇshalom,
my son, my son!” 
2Sam
19:5  And Yo’aḇ came into the house
to the sovereign, and said, “Today you have put to shame all your servants who
today have saved your life, and the lives of your sons and daughters, and the
lives of your wives and the lives of your concubines, 
2Sam
19:6  by loving those who hate you, and
by hating those who love you. For you have made it clear today that you have
neither commanders nor servants, for today I know that if Aḇshalom had
lived and all of us had died today, then it would be right in your eyes. 
2Sam
19:7  “And now, arise, go out and speak
to the heart of your servants. For I swear by יהוה, if
you do not go out, not one passes the night with you. And that is worse for you
than all the evil that has come upon you from your youth until now.” 
2Sam
19:8  So the sovereign rose up and sat in
the gate. And they told all the people, saying, “Look, the sovereign is sitting
in the gate.” And all the people came before the sovereign. As for Yisra’ĕl,
they had fled, each one to his tent. 
2Sam
19:9  And it came to be, that all the
people were contending throughout all the tribes of Yisra’ĕl, saying, “The
sovereign delivered us from the hand of the enemies, he rescued us from the
hand of the Philistines, and now he has fled from the land because of Aḇshalom,

2Sam
19:10  and Aḇshalom, whom we
anointed over us, has died in battle. And now, why are you silent about
bringing back the sovereign?” 
2Sam
19:11  And Sovereign Dawiḏ sent to
Tsaḏoq and Eḇyathar the priests, saying, “Speak to the elders of
Yehuḏah, saying, ‘Why are you the last to bring the sovereign back to his
house, since the words of all Yisra’ĕl have come to the sovereign, to his
house? 
2Sam
19:12  ‘You are my brothers, you are my
bone and my flesh. Why then are you the last to bring back the sovereign?’ 
2Sam
19:13  “And say to Amasa, ‘Are you not my
bone and my flesh? Elohim do so to me, and more also, if you are not commander
of the army before me all the days in place of Yo’aḇ.’ ” 
2Sam
19:14  Thus he swayed the hearts of all
the men of Yehuḏah as one man, so that they sent to the sovereign, saying “Return, you and all your
servants!” 
2Sam
19:15  So the sovereign returned and came
to the Yardĕn. And Yehuḏah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the
sovereign, to bring the sovereign over the Yardĕn. 
2Sam
19:16  And Shim‛i son of Gĕra,
a Binyamite, who was from Baḥurim, hastened and came down with the men of
Yehuḏah to meet Sovereign Dawiḏ. 
2Sam
19:17  And with him were a thousand men
of Binyamin, and Tsiḇa the servant of the house of Sha’ul, and his
fifteen sons, and his twenty servants with him. And they rushed over the Yardĕn
before the sovereign.
2Sam
19:18  And they passed over the ford to
bring over the sovereign’s household, and to do what was good in his eyes. And
Shim‛i son of Gĕra fell down before the sovereign when he had passed
over the Yardĕn, 
2Sam
19:19  and said to the sovereign, “Do not
let my master reckon crookedness to me, neither remember what wrong your
servant did on the day that my master the sovereign left Yerushalayim, that the
sovereign should take it to heart. 
2Sam
19:20  “For I, your servant, know that I
have sinned. And see, I have come today, first of all the house of Yosĕph,
to go down to meet my master the sovereign.” 
2Sam
19:21  But Aḇishai son of Tseruyah
answered and said, “Should Shim‛i not be put to death for this, because
he cursed the anointed of יהוה ?” 
2Sam
19:22  And Dawiḏ said, “What have I
to do with you, you sons of Tseruyah, that you are to be adversaries to me
today? Should any man be put to death in Yisra’ĕl today? For do I not know
that I am sovereign over Yisra’ĕl today?” 
2Sam
19:23  So the sovereign said to Shim‛i,
“You do not die.” And the sovereign swore to him. 
2Sam
19:24  And Mephiḇosheth son of Sha’ul
came down to meet the sovereign. And he had not attended to his feet, nor
trimmed his moustache, nor washed his garments, from the day the sovereign went
away until the day he came back in peace. 
2Sam
19:25  And it came to be, when he had
come to Yerushalayim to meet the sovereign, that the sovereign said to him, “Why
did you not go with me, Mephiḇosheth?” 
2Sam
19:26  And he answered, “My master, O
sovereign, my servant deceived me. For your servant said, ‘I am saddling a
donkey for myself to ride on it and go to the sovereign,’ because your servant
is lame. 
2Sam
19:27  “And he spoke slander against your
servant to my master the sovereign, but my master the sovereign is as a
messenger of Elohim. Therefore do what is good in your eyes. 
2Sam
19:28  “For all of my father’s house were
but dead men before my master the sovereign. Yet you set your servant among
those who eat at your own table. Therefore what right have I still to cry out
any more to the sovereign?” 
2Sam
19:29  Then the sovereign said to him, “Why
do you speak any more of your matters? I have said, ‘You and Tsiḇa share
the land.’ ” 
2Sam
19:30  And Mephiḇosheth said to the
sovereign, “Rather, let him take it all, since my master the sovereign has come
back in peace to his own house.” 
2Sam
19:31  And Barzillai the Gil‛aḏite
came down from Roḡelim and passed over the Yardĕn with the
sovereign, to send him on his way over the Yardĕn. 
2Sam
19:32  And Barzillai was a very aged man,
eighty years old. And he had sustained the sovereign while he was dwelling at
Maḥanayim, for he was a very rich man. 
2Sam
19:33  And the sovereign said to
Barzillai, “Pass over with me, and I shall provide for you with me in
Yerushalayim.” 
2Sam
19:34  But Barzillai said to the
sovereign, “How many are the days of my life, that I should go up with the
sovereign to Yerushalayim?
2Sam
19:35  “I am now eighty years old. Do I
discern between the good and evil? Does your servant taste what I eat or what I
drink? Do I still hear the voice of singing men and singing women? Why then
should your servant be a further burden to my master the sovereign? 
2Sam
19:36  “Your servant would only pass over
the Yardĕn with the sovereign for a short distance. And why should the
sovereign repay me with such a reward? 
2Sam
19:37  “Please let your servant turn back
again to die in my own city, near the burying-place of my father and mother.
But here is your servant Kimham, let him pass over with my master the
sovereign, and do for him what is good in your eyes.” 
2Sam
19:38  And the sovereign answered, “Kimham
is passing over with me, and let me do for him what is good in your eyes. Now
whatever you choose of me, I do for you.”
2Sam
19:39  Then all the people went over the
Yardĕn. And when the sovereign had passed over, the sovereign kissed
Barzillai and blessed him, and he returned to his own place. 
2Sam
19:40  And the sovereign passed over to
Gilgal, and Kimham passed over with him. And all the people of Yehuḏah
brought the sovereign over, and also half the people of Yisra’ĕl.
2Sam
19:41  And see, all the men of Yisra’ĕl
were coming to the sovereign! And they said to the sovereign, “Why have our
brothers, the men of Yehuḏah, stolen you away and brought the sovereign,
and his household, and all Dawiḏ’s men with him over the Yardĕn?” 
2Sam
19:42  And all the men of Yehuḏah
answered the men of Yisra’ĕl, “Because the sovereign is our relative. And
why are you displeased over this matter? Have we at all eaten at the sovereign’s
cost? Or has he given us any gift?” 
2Sam
19:43  And the men of Yisra’ĕl
answered the men of Yehuḏah, and said, “We have ten parts in the
sovereign, and in Dawiḏ too, we have more than you. Why then did you
despise us? Was it not our advice first to bring back our sovereign?” But the
words of the men of Yehuḏah were harsher than the words of the men of
Yisra’ĕl. 
2Sam
20:1  And there came to be a man of
Beliya‛al, whose name was Sheḇa son of Biḵri, a Binyamite.
And he blew a ram’s horn, and said, “We have no part in Dawiḏ, nor do we
have inheritance in the son of Yishai – each one to his tents, O Yisra’ĕl!”

2Sam
20:2  Then all the men of Yisra’ĕl
deserted Dawiḏ, to follow Sheḇa the son of Biḵri. But the men
of Yehuḏah, from the Yardĕn as far as Yerushalayim, clung to their
sovereign.
2Sam
20:3  And Dawiḏ came to his house
at Yerushalayim. And the sovereign took the ten women, his concubines whom he
had left to look after the house, and put them in a protected house and
supported them, but did not go in to them. So they were shut up to the day of
their death, living in widowhood. 
2Sam
20:4  And the sovereign said to Amasa, “Call
the men of Yehuḏah for me within three days, and be present here
yourself.” 
2Sam
20:5  And Amasa went to call the men of
Yehuḏah. But he delayed longer than the appointed time which Dawiḏ
had appointed him. 
2Sam
20:6  And Dawiḏ said to Aḇishai,
“Now Sheḇa son of Biḵri is going to do us more evil than Aḇshalom.
Take the servants of your master, and pursue him, lest he find for himself
walled cities, and escape us.” 
2Sam
20:7  Then the men of Yo’aḇ went
out after him, with the Kerĕthites and the Pelĕthites, and all the
mighty men. And they went out of Yerushalayim to pursue Sheḇa son of Biḵri.

2Sam
20:8  When they were near the large stone
which is in Giḇ‛on, Amasa came before them. And Yo’aḇ was
dressed in battle armour, and on it was a girdle with a sword fastened in its
sheath at his hips. And as he went forward, it fell out. 
2Sam
20:9  And Yo’aḇ said to Amasa, “Peace,
my brother?” And Yo’aḇ took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to
kiss him. 
2Sam
20:10  But Amasa was not on guard against
the sword in Yo’aḇ’s hand. And he struck him with it in the stomach, and
his inward parts poured out on the ground, and he did not strike him again, and he died. Then Yo’aḇ and Aḇishai
his brother pursued Sheḇa son of Biḵri. 
2Sam
20:11  And a man, one of Yo’aḇ’s
men, stood beside him, and said, “Whoever is well pleased with Yo’aḇ and
whoever is for Dawiḏ, let him follow Yo’aḇ!” 
2Sam
20:12  And Amasa was rolling in his blood
in the middle of the highway. And the man saw that all the people stood still,
so he moved Amasa from the highway to the field and threw a garment over him,
when he saw that everyone who came upon him halted. 
2Sam
20:13  When he was removed from the
highway, all the men passed on after Yo’aḇ to pursue Sheḇa son of
Biḵri. 
2Sam
20:14  And he passed over through all the
tribes of Yisra’ĕl to Aḇĕl, and to Bĕyth Ma‛aḵah,
and to all the Bĕrites. And they were assembled and went after him too. 
2Sam
20:15  And they went and besieged him in
Aḇĕl of Bĕyth Ma‛aḵah, and they cast up a siege
mound against the city. And it stood in a rampart, and all the people who were
with Yo’aḇ battered the wall to throw it down. 
2Sam
20:16  Then a wise woman called out from
the city, “Listen, listen! Please say to Yo’aḇ, ‘Come nearby, so that I
speak to you.’ ” 
2Sam
20:17  And he came near to her, and the
woman said, “Are you Yo’aḇ?” And he answered, “I am.” Then she said to
him, “Listen to the words of your female servant.” And he answered, “I am
listening.” 
2Sam
20:18  Then she spoke, saying, “In former
times they often spoke, saying, ‘Let them inquire of Aḇĕl,’ and so
they ended the matter. 
2Sam
20:19  “I am of the peaceable and
trustworthy ones in Yisra’ĕl. You seek to destroy a city and a mother in
Yisra’ĕl. Why do you swallow up the inheritance of יהוה
?” 
2Sam
20:20  And Yo’aḇ answered and said,
“Far be it, far be it from me to swallow up or to destroy! 
2Sam
20:21  “That is not the case. But a man
from the mountains of Ephrayim, Sheḇa son of Biḵri by name, has
raised his hand against the sovereign, against Dawiḏ. Hand him over, him
alone, and I withdraw from the city.” And the woman said to Yo’aḇ, “Look,
his head is going to be thrown to you over the wall.” 
2Sam
20:22  So the woman in her wisdom went to
all the people. And they cut off the head of Sheḇa son of Biḵri,
and threw it out to Yo’aḇ. Then he blew a ram’s horn, and they dispersed
from the city, each one to his tent. And Yo’aḇ returned to the sovereign
at Yerushalayim.
2Sam
20:23  Now Yo’aḇ was over all the
army of Yisra’ĕl, and Benayah son of Yehoyaḏa was over the Kerĕthites
and the Pelĕthites, 
2Sam
20:24  and Aḏoram was over the
compulsory labour, and Yehoshaphat son of Aḥiluḏ was recorder, 
2Sam
20:25  and Shewa was scribe, and Tsaḏoq
and Eḇyathar were the priests, 
2Sam
20:26  and Ira the Ya‛irite was
priest to Dawiḏ. 
2Sam
21:1  And there was a scarcity of food in
the days of Dawiḏ for three years, year after year. And Dawiḏ
sought the face of יהוה, and יהוה
answered, “Because of Sha’ul and his bloodthirsty house, because he killed the
Giḇ‛onites.” 
2Sam
21:2  The sovereign therefore called the
Giḇ‛onites and spoke to them. Now the Giḇ‛onites were
not of the children of Yisra’ĕl, but of the remnant of the Amorites. And
the children of Yisra’ĕl had sworn protection to them, but Sha’ul had
sought to kill them in his ardour for the children of Yisra’ĕl and Yehuḏah.

2Sam
21:3  So Dawiḏ said to the Giḇ‛onites,
“What should I do for you? And with what do I make atonement, so that you bless
the inheritance of יהוה ?” 
2Sam
21:4  And the Giḇ‛onites said
to him, “It is no matter of silver or gold between us and Sha’ul, or his house,
neither is it for us to put to death any man in Yisra’ĕl.” And he said, “Whatever
you say I do for you.” 
2Sam
21:5  And they said to the sovereign, “The
man who consumed us and plotted against us, that we should be destroyed from
remaining in all the border of Yisra’ĕl, 
2Sam
21:6  let seven men of his sons be given
to us, and we shall hang them before יהוה in Giḇ‛ah
of Sha’ul, whom יהוה chose.” And the sovereign said, “I
give them.” 
2Sam
21:7  But the sovereign spared Mephiḇosheth
son of Yehonathan, son of Sha’ul, because of the oath of יהוה
that was between them, between Dawiḏ and Yehonathan son of Sha’ul. 
2Sam
21:8  And the sovereign took the two sons
of Ritspah the daughter of Ayah, whom she bore to Sha’ul: Armoni and the other Mephiḇosheth, and the
five sons of Miḵal the daughter of Sha’ul, whom she brought up for Aḏri’ĕl
the son of Barzillai, the Meḥolathite, 
2Sam
21:9  and gave them into the hands of the
Giḇ‛onites, and they hanged them on the hill before יהוה.
So the seven fell together, and were put to death in the days of harvest, in
the first days, in the beginning of barley harvest. 
2Sam
21:10  And Ritspah the daughter of Ayah
took sackcloth and spread it for herself on the rock, from the beginning of
harvest until the late rains poured on them from the heavens. And she did not
allow the birds of the heavens to rest on them by day nor the beasts of the
field by night. 
2Sam
21:11  And Dawiḏ was informed what
Ritspah the daughter of Ayah, the concubine of Sha’ul, had done. 
2Sam
21:12  And Dawiḏ went and took the
bones of Sha’ul, and the bones of Yehonathan his son, from the men of Yaḇĕsh
Gil‛aḏ who had stolen them from the street of Bĕyth Shan,
where the Philistines had hung them up, after the Philistines had struck down
Sha’ul in Gilboa. 
2Sam
21:13  And he brought up the bones of Sha’ul
and the bones of Yehonathan his son from there, and they gathered the bones of
those who had been hanged, 
2Sam
21:14  and buried the bones of Sha’ul and
Yehonathan his son in the land of Binyamin in Tsela, in the tomb of Qish his
father, and did all that the sovereign commanded. And after that Elohim heard
prayer for the land. 
2Sam
21:15  And the Philistines were again
fighting against Yisra’ĕl, so Dawiḏ and his servants with him went
down and fought against the Philistines. And Dawiḏ was weary, 
2Sam
21:16  and Yishbo-Benoḇ – who was
one of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose bronze spear was three
hundred pieces, who was bearing a new sword – spoke of killing Dawiḏ. 
2Sam
21:17  But Aḇishai son of Tseruyah
came to help him, and smote the Philistine and killed him. Then Dawiḏ’s
men swore to him, saying, “Do not go out with us to battle any more, lest you
put out the lamp of Yisra’ĕl.”
2Sam
21:18  And it came to be afterward, that
there was a battle again with the Philistines at Goḇ. Then Sibbeḵai
the Ḥushathite smote Saph, who was one of the sons of the giant. 
2Sam
21:19  And there was a battle with the
Philistines again at Goḇ, where Elḥanan son of Ya‛arĕy-Oreḡim
the Bĕyth Leḥemite smote Golyath the Gittite, the shaft of whose
spear was like a weaver’s beam. 
2Sam
21:20  And there was a battle in Gath
again, where there was a man of great height, who had six fingers on each hand
and six toes on each foot, twenty-four in number. And he also was descended
from the giants. 
2Sam
21:21  And he reproached Yisra’ĕl,
and Yehonathan son of Shim‛i, the brother of Dawiḏ, smote him. 
2Sam
21:22  These four were born to the giant
in Gath, and they fell by the hand of Dawiḏ and by the hand of his servants.

2Sam
22:1  Then Dawiḏ spoke to יהוה
the words of this song, on the day when יהוה had
delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Sha’ul. 
2Sam
22:2  And he said, “ יהוה
is my rock and my stronghold and my deliverer. 
2Sam
22:3  “My Elohim is my rock, I take
refuge in Him, My shield and the horn of my deliverance, My high tower and my
refuge. My Saviour, You save me from violence.
2Sam
22:4  “I call on יהוה,
the One to be praised, And I am saved from my enemies.
2Sam
22:5  “For the waves of death surrounded
me, Floods of Beliya‛al made me afraid,
2Sam
22:6  “The cords of the grave were all
around me; The snares of death were before me.
2Sam
22:7  “In my distress I called upon יהוה,
And to my Elohim I cried. And from His Hĕḵal He heard my voice, And
my cry was in His ears.
2Sam
22:8  “And the earth shook and trembled,
The foundations of the heavens were troubled, Because He was wroth.
2Sam
22:9  “Smoke went up from His nostrils,
And devouring fire from His mouth; Coals were kindled by it.
2Sam
22:10  “And He bowed the heavens and came
down, And thick darkness was under His feet.
2Sam
22:11  “And He rode upon a keruḇ,
and flew, And was seen upon the wings of the wind.
2Sam
22:12  “And He put darkness around Him as
booths, Darkness of waters, thick clouds.
2Sam
22:13  “From the brightness before Him
Coals of fire were kindled.
2Sam
22:14  “ יהוה
thundered from the heavens, And the Most High sent forth His voice.
2Sam
22:15  “And He sent out arrows and
scattered them, Lightning, and confused them.
2Sam
22:16  “And the channels of the sea were
seen, The foundations of the world were uncovered At the rebuke of יהוה,
At the blast of the breath of His nostrils.
2Sam
22:17  “He sent from above, He took me,
He drew me out of many waters.
2Sam
22:18  “He delivered me from my strong
enemy, From those hating me, For they were stronger than I.
2Sam
22:19  “They confronted me in the day of
my calamity, But יהוה was my support.
2Sam
22:20  “And He brought me out into a
large place, He delivered me for He delighted in me.
2Sam
22:21  “ יהוה
rewarded me according to my righteousness; According to the cleanness of my
hands He repaid me.
2Sam
22:22  “For I have guarded the ways of יהוה,
And have not acted wrongly against my Elohim.
2Sam
22:23  “For all His right-rulings are
before me; As for His laws, I do not turn from them.
2Sam
22:24  “And I am perfect before Him, And
I guard myself from my crookedness.
2Sam
22:25  “And יהוה
repays me according to my righteousness, According to my cleanness before His
eyes.
2Sam
22:26  “With the kind You show Yourself
kind, With the perfect one You show Yourself perfect,
2Sam
22:27  “With the clean You show Yourself
clean, And with the crooked You show Yourself twisted.
2Sam
22:28  “For You save the humble people,
But Your eyes are on the haughty to bring them low.
2Sam
22:29  “For You are my lamp, O יהוה,
And יהוה makes my darkness light.
2Sam
22:30  “For with You I run against a
band, With my Elohim I leap over a wall.
2Sam
22:31  “The Ĕl – His way is perfect;
The Word of יהוה is proven; He is a shield to all who
take refuge in Him.
2Sam
22:32  “For who is Ĕl, besides יהוה
? And who is a rock, besides our Elohim?
2Sam
22:33  “Ĕl is my mighty stronghold,
And He makes my way perfect,
2Sam
22:34  “Making my feet like the feet of
deer, And sets me on my high places,
2Sam
22:35  “Teaching my hands for battle, So
that my arms bend a bow of bronze.
2Sam
22:36  “And You give me the shield of
Your deliverance, And Your lowliness makes me great.
2Sam
22:37  “You enlarge my step under me, So
that my feet shall not slip.
2Sam
22:38  “I pursue my enemies and destroy
them, And I do not turn back till they are destroyed.
2Sam
22:39  “And I destroy them and crush
them, So that they do not rise, And fall under my feet.
2Sam
22:40  “And You gird me with strength for
battle, You cause my adversaries to bow under me.
2Sam
22:41  “And You make my enemies turn
their backs, Those hating me, and I cut them off.
2Sam
22:42  “They look but there is no
saviour, Unto יהוה, but He shall not answer them.
2Sam
22:43  “And I beat them as dust of the
earth, I beat them small as dirt in the streets – I spread them out.
2Sam
22:44  “And You deliver me from the
strivings of my people, You safeguard me as the head of the nations; A people I
have not known serve me.
2Sam
22:45  “Sons of the foreigner submit to
me, As soon as they hear they obey me.
2Sam
22:46  “Sons of the foreigner fade away,
And gird themselves from their strongholds.
2Sam
22:47  “ יהוה
lives! And blessed is my Rock! And exalted is my Elohim, The Rock of my
deliverance,
2Sam
22:48  “Ĕl who avenges me, And
bringing peoples down under me,
2Sam
22:49  “And bringing me out from my
enemies; You raise me up above those rising up against me; You deliver me from
a man of violence.
2Sam
22:50  “Therefore I give thanks to You, O
יהוה, among nations, And I sing praise to Your Name.
2Sam
22:51  “A tower of deliverance is He to
His sovereign, And showing kindness to His anointed, To Dawiḏ and his
seed, forever.”
2Sam
23:1  And these are the last words of
Dawiḏ, the saying of Dawiḏ son of Yishai, the saying of the man
raised up on high, the anointed of the Elohim of Ya‛aqoḇ, and the
sweet singer of Yisra’ĕl: 
2Sam
23:2  “The Spirit of יהוה
has spoken through me, And His word is on my tongue.
2Sam
23:3  “The Elohim of Yisra’ĕl said,
The Rock of Yisra’ĕl spoke to me, ‘One who rules over man righteously,
2Sam
23:4  “Who rules in the fear of Elohim,
Is like the light of the morning when the sun rises, A morning without clouds,
Tender grass from the earth From sunshine, from rain.’
2Sam
23:5  “For is not my house so with Ĕl?
For He has made an everlasting covenant with me, Ordered in all matters, and guarded. For all my
deliverance and all desire, Shall He not make it send forth a Branch?
2Sam
23:6  “But the worthless are all as
thorns thrust away, For they are not taken with hands,
2Sam
23:7  “But the man who touches them Uses
iron or the shaft of a spear, And with fire they are burned up in their place.”
2Sam
23:8  These are the names of the mighty
men whom Dawiḏ had: Yoshĕḇ-Bassheḇeth the
Taḥkemonite, chief among the officers, he was Aḏino the Etsnite,
for eight hundred slain at one time. 
2Sam
23:9  And after him was El‛azar son
of Doḏo, the Aḥoḥite, one of the three mighty men with Dawiḏ
when they taunted the Philistines who were gathered there for battle, and the
men of Yisra’ĕl had gone up. 
2Sam
23:10  He arose and smote the Philistines
until his hand was weary, but his hand clung to the sword, so יהוה
brought about a great deliverance that day. And the people returned after him
only to plunder. 
2Sam
23:11  And after him was Shammah son of Aḡĕ
the Hararite. And the Philistines had gathered into a company where there was a
plot of ground covered with lentils, and the people fled from the Philistines. 
2Sam
23:12  But he took his stand in the
middle of the field, and delivered it, and smote the Philistines, and יהוה
wrought a great deliverance. 
2Sam
23:13  And three of the thirty chief men
went down at harvest time and came to Dawiḏ at the cave of Aḏullam,
while the army of Philistines encamped in the Valley of Repha’im. 
2Sam
23:14  And Dawiḏ was then in the
stronghold, while a watch-post of the Philistines was then in Bĕyth
Leḥem. 
2Sam
23:15  And Dawiḏ longed and said, “Oh
that someone would give me a drink of the water from the well of Bĕyth
Leḥem, which is by the gate!” 
2Sam
23:16  And the three mighty men broke
through the camp of the Philistines, and drew water from the well of Bĕyth
Leḥem that was by the gate, and took it and brought it to Dawiḏ.
But he would not drink it, but poured it out to יהוה. 
2Sam
23:17  And he said, “Far be it from me, O
יהוה, to do this – the blood of the men who went at the
risk of their lives!” So he would not drink it. This is what the three mighty
men did. 
2Sam
23:18  And Aḇishai the brother of
Yo’aḇ, son of Tseruyah, was chief of another three. And he lifted his
spear against three hundred men whom he slew, and had a name among these three.

2Sam
23:19  Was he not the most esteemed of
three? And he became their commander, but he did not come to the first three. 
2Sam
23:20  And Benayahu was the son of Yehoyaḏa,
son of a brave man from Qaḇtse’ĕl, great in deeds. He smote two
lion-like men of Mo’aḇ. And he went down and smote a lion in the midst of
a pit on a snowy day. 
2Sam
23:21  And he smote a Mitsrite, an
impressive man. And the Mitsrite had a spear in his hand, so he went down to
him with a staff, wrested the spear out of the Mitsrite’s hand, and slew him
with his own spear. 
2Sam
23:22  This is what Benayahu son of
Yehoyaḏa did, and had a name among three mighty men. 
2Sam
23:23  He was more esteemed than the
thirty, but he did not come to the first three. And Dawiḏ set him over
his guard. 
2Sam
23:24  Asah’ĕl the brother of Yo’aḇ
was one of the thirty; Elḥanan son of Doḏo of Bĕyth
Leḥem, 
2Sam
23:25  Shammah the Ḥaroḏite,
Eliqa the Ḥaroḏite, 
2Sam
23:26  Ḥelets the Paltite, Ira son
of Iqqĕsh the Teqowite, 
2Sam
23:27  Aḇi‛ezer the Anethothite,
Meḇunnai the Ḥushathite, 
2Sam
23:28  Tsalmon the Aḥoḥite,
Maharai the Netophathite, 
2Sam
23:29  Ḥĕleḇ son of Ba‛anah
the Netophathite, Ittai son of Riḇai from Giḇ‛ah of the
children of Binyamin, 
2Sam
23:30  Benayahu the Pirathonite, Hiddai
from the wadis of Ga‛ash, 
2Sam
23:31  Aḇi-Alḇon the
Arbathite, Azmaweth the Barḥumite, 
2Sam
23:32  Elyaḥba the Sha‛albonite
of the sons of Yashĕn, Yehonathan, 
2Sam
23:33  Shammah the Hararite, Aḥyam
son of Sharar the Hararite, 
2Sam
23:34  Eliphelet son of Aḥasbai,
son of the Ma‛aḵathite, Eliyam son of Aḥithophel the
Gilonite, 
2Sam
23:35  Ḥetsrai the Karmelite, Pa‛arai
the Arbite, 
2Sam
23:36  Yiḡ’al son of Nathan of Tsoḇah,
Bani the Gaḏite, 
2Sam
23:37  Tseleq the Ammonite, Naḥarai
the Be’ĕrothite, armour-bearer of Yo’aḇ son of Tseruyah, 
2Sam
23:38  Ira the Yithrite, Garĕḇ
the Yithrite, 
2Sam
23:39  and Uriyah the Ḥittite –
thirty-seven in all.
2Sam
24:1  And again the displeasure of יהוה
burned against Yisra’ĕl, and moved Dawiḏ against them to say, “Go,
number Yisra’ĕl and Yehuḏah.” 
2Sam
24:2  And the sovereign said to Yo’aḇ
the commander of the army who was with him, “Go please, throughout all the
tribes of Yisra’ĕl, from Dan to Be’ĕrsheḇa, and register the
people, so that I know the number of the people.” 
2Sam
24:3  And Yo’aḇ said to the
sovereign, “Even if יהוה your Elohim does add to the
people a hundredfold more than there are, and the eyes of my master the
sovereign see it, but why does my master the sovereign delight in this matter?”

2Sam
24:4  However, the sovereign’s word
prevailed against Yo’aḇ and against the commanders of the army. And Yo’aḇ
and the commanders of the army went out from the presence of the sovereign to
register the people of Yisra’ĕl. 
2Sam
24:5  And they passed over the Yardĕn
and camped in Aro‛ĕr, on the right side of the town which is in the
midst of the wadi of Gaḏ, and toward Ya‛zĕr. 
2Sam
24:6  Then they came to Gil‛aḏ
and to the land of Taḥtim Ḥoḏshi, and they came to Dan Ya‛an
and around to Tsiḏon. 
2Sam
24:7  And they came to the stronghold of
Tsor and to all the cities of the Ḥiwwites and the Kena‛anites, and
went out to South Yehuḏah as far as Be’ĕrsheḇa. 
2Sam
24:8  And when they had gone through all
the land, they came to Yerushalayim at the end of nine months and twenty days. 
2Sam
24:9  And Yo’aḇ gave the number of
the registration of the people to the sovereign, and there were in Yisra’ĕl
eight hundred thousand brave men who drew the sword, and the men of Yehuḏah
were five hundred thousand men. 
2Sam
24:10  And the heart of Dawiḏ smote
him after he had numbered the people. And Dawiḏ said to יהוה,
“I have sinned greatly in what I have done. But now, I pray, O יהוה,
take away the crookedness of Your servant, for I have done very foolishly.” 
2Sam
24:11  And Dawiḏ rose up in the
morning, and the word of יהוה came to the prophet Gaḏ,
Dawiḏ’s seer, saying, 
2Sam
24:12  “Go, and you shall speak to Dawiḏ,
‘Thus said יהוה, “I hold three options before you. Choose one of them, and I do it to you.” ’ ”
2Sam
24:13  Gaḏ then came to Dawiḏ
and informed him. And he said to him, “Should seven years of scarcity of food
come to you in your land? Or would you flee three months before your enemies,
while they pursue you? Or should there be three days’ plague in your land? Now
know and see what answer I take back to Him who sent me.” 
2Sam
24:14  And Dawiḏ said to Gaḏ,
“I am in great trouble. Please let us fall into the hand of יהוה,
for His compassion is great, but do not let me fall into the hand of man.” 
2Sam
24:15  And יהוה
sent a plague upon Yisra’ĕl from the morning till the appointed time, and
from Dan to Be’ĕrsheḇa seventy thousand men of the people died. 
2Sam
24:16  And the messenger stretched out
His hand over Yerushalayim to destroy it, and יהוה
relented concerning the evil, and said to the messenger who was destroying the
people, “It is enough, now stop Your hand.” And the messenger of יהוה
was by the threshing-floor of Arawnah the Yeḇusite. 
2Sam
24:17  And Dawiḏ spoke to יהוה
when he saw the messenger who was smiting the people, and said, “See, I have
sinned, and I have done perversely. But these sheep, what have they done? Let
Your hand, I pray, be against me and against my father’s house.” 
2Sam
24:18  And Gaḏ came that day to
Dawiḏ and said to him, “Go up, raise an altar to יהוה
on the threshing-floor of Arawnah the Yeḇusite.” 
2Sam
24:19  And Dawiḏ, according to the
word of Gaḏ, went up as יהוה commanded. 
2Sam
24:20  And Arawnah looked and saw the
sovereign and his servants coming toward him. And Arawnah went out and bowed
before the sovereign with his face to the ground. 
2Sam
24:21  And Arawnah said, “Why has my
master the sovereign come to his servant?” And Dawiḏ said, “To buy the
threshing-floor from you, to build an altar to יהוה, so
that the plague be withdrawn from the people.”
2Sam
24:22  And Arawnah said to Dawiḏ, “Let
my master the sovereign take and offer that which seems good to him. Here are
cattle for burnt offering, and threshing implements and the yokes of the cattle
for wood. 
2Sam
24:23  “All these, O sovereign, Arawnah
has given to the sovereign.” And Arawnah said to the sovereign, “ יהוה
your Elohim accept you!”
2Sam
24:24  And the sovereign said to Arawnah,
“No, let me buy it from you for a price, for certain. I am not offering burnt
offerings to יהוה my Elohim without cost.” So Dawiḏ
bought the threshing-floor and the cattle for fifty sheqels of silver. 
2Sam
24:25  And Dawiḏ built an altar to יהוה
there, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. And יהוה
answered the prayers for the land, and the plague was withdrawn from Yisra’ĕl.
