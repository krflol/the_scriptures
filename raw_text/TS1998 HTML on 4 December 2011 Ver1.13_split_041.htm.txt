Oḇaḏyah/Obadiah
Obad
1:1  The vision of Oḇaḏyah:
This is what the Master יהוה said concerning Eḏom.
We have heard a report from יהוה, and a messenger has
been sent among the nations, saying, “Arise, and let us rise up against her for
battle!” 
Obad
1:2  “See, I have made you small among
the nations, you are greatly despised. 
Obad
1:3  “The pride of your heart has
deceived you, you who dwell in the clefts of the rock, whose dwelling is high,
who say in your heart, ‘Who shall bring me down to the ground?’ 
Obad
1:4  “Though you rise high as the eagle,
and though you set your nest among the stars, from there I shall bring you
down,” declares יהוה. 
Obad
1:5  “If thieves came to you, if robbers
by night, how ruined you would have been! Would they not steal till they had
enough? If grape-gatherers had come to you, would they not leave gleanings? 
Obad
1:6  “How Ĕsaw shall be searched
out! His hidden treasures shall be sought out! 
Obad
1:7  “All your allies shall send you
forth to the border, your friends shall deceive you and overpower you. They
make your bread a snare under you, without you discerning it! 
Obad
1:8  “In that day,” declares יהוה,
“I shall destroy the wise men from Eḏom, and discernment from the
mountains of Ĕsaw! 
Obad
1:9  “And your mighty men shall be
discouraged, O Tĕman, so that everyone from the mountains of Ĕsaw is
cut off by slaughter. 
Obad
1:10  “Because of your violence against your
brother Ya‛aqoḇ, let shame cover you. And you shall be cut off
forever. 
Obad
1:11  “In the day that you stood on the
other side, in the day that strangers took captive his wealth, when foreigners
entered his gates and cast lots for Yerushalayim, you also were like one of
them! 
Obad
1:12  “And you should not have looked on
your brother’s day in the day of his estrangement, nor rejoiced over the
children of Yehuḏah in the day of their destruction, nor made your mouth
great in the day of distress, 
Obad
1:13  nor have entered the gate of My
people in the day of their calamity, nor looked down on their evil in the day
of their calamity, nor have seized their wealth in the day of their calamity, 
Obad
1:14  nor have stood at the parting of
the way to cut off his fugitives, nor handed over his survivors in the day of
distress. 
Obad
1:15  “For the day of יהוה
is near upon all the gentiles. As you have done, it shall be done to you, your
reward shall come back on your own head. 
Obad
1:16  “For as you have drunk on my
set-apart mountain, so do all the gentiles drink continually. And they shall
drink and shall swallow, and they shall be as though they had never been. 
Obad
1:17  “But on Mount Tsiyon there shall be
an escape, and they shall be set-apart. And the house of Ya‛aqoḇ
shall possess their possessions.
Obad
1:18  “And the house of Ya‛aqoḇ
shall be a fire, and the house of Yosĕph a flame, but the house of Ĕsaw
for stubble. And they shall burn among them and they shall consume them, so
that no survivor is left of the house of Ĕsaw.” For יהוה
has spoken. 
Obad
1:19  And they shall possess the South
with the mountains of Ĕsaw, and low country with the Philistines. And they
shall possess the fields of Ephrayim and the fields of Shomeron, and Binyamin
with Gil‛aḏ, 
Obad
1:20  and the exiles of this host of the
children of Yisra’ĕl possess
that of the Kena‛anites as far as Tsarephath, and the exiles of
Yerushalayim who are in Sepharaḏ possess the cities of the South. 
Obad
1:21  And saviours shall come to Mount Tsiyon
to judge the mountains of Ĕsaw. And the reign shall belong to יהוה.
