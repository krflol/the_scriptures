Gen
27:39  And Yitsḥaq his father
answered and said to him, “See, your dwelling is of the fatness of the earth,
and of the dew of the heavens from above. 
Gen
27:40  And by your sword you are to live,
and serve your brother. And it shall be, when you grow restless, that you shall
break his yoke from your neck.” 
Gen
27:41  And Ĕsaw hated Ya‛aqoḇ
because of the blessing with which his father blessed him, and Ĕsaw said
in his heart, “The days of mourning for my father draw near, then I am going to
kill my brother Ya‛aqoḇ.” 
Gen
27:42  And the words of Ĕsaw her
older son were reported to Riḇqah, and she sent and called Ya‛aqoḇ
her younger son, and said to him, “See, your brother Ĕsaw comforts himself
concerning you, to kill you. 
Gen
27:43  “And now, my son, listen to my
voice, and rise, flee to my brother Laḇan in Ḥaran. 
Gen
27:44  “And stay with him a few days,
until your brother’s wrath turns away, 
Gen
27:45  until your brother’s displeasure
turns away from you, and he forgets what you have done to him. And I shall send
and bring you from there. Why should I be bereaved of you both in one day?” 
Gen
27:46  And Riḇqah said to
Yitsḥaq, “I am disgusted with my life because of the daughters of Ḥĕth.
If Ya‛aqoḇ takes a wife from the daughters of Ḥĕth, like
these who are the daughters of the land, what is my life to me?” 
Gen
28:1  And Yitsḥaq called Ya‛aqoḇ
and blessed him, and commanded him, and said to him, “Do not take a wife from
the daughters of Kena‛an. 
Gen
28:2  “Arise, go to Paddan Aram, to the
house of Bethu’ĕl your mother’s father. And take a wife for yourself from
there, from the daughters of Laḇan your mother’s brother. 
Gen
28:3  “And Ĕl Shaddai bless you, and
make you bear fruit and increase you, and you shall become an assembly of
peoples, 
Gen
28:4  and give you the blessing of Aḇraham,
to you and your seed with you, so that you inherit the land of your
sojournings, which Elohim gave to Aḇraham.” 
Gen
28:5  So Yitsḥaq sent Ya‛aqoḇ
away, and he went to Paddan Aram, to Laḇan son of Bethu’ĕl the
Aramean, the brother of Riḇqah, the mother of Ya‛aqoḇ and Ĕsaw.

Gen
28:6  And Ĕsaw saw that
Yitsḥaq had blessed Ya‛aqoḇ and sent him away to Paddan Aram
to take himself a wife from there, and that as he blessed him he gave him a
command, saying, “Do not take a wife from the daughters of Kena‛an,” 
Gen
28:7  and that Ya‛aqoḇ had
obeyed his father and his mother and had gone to Paddan Aram. 
Gen
28:8  So Ĕsaw saw that the daughters
of Kena‛an did not please his father Yitsḥaq, 
Gen
28:9  and Ĕsaw went to Yishma‛ĕl
and took Maḥalath the daughter of Yishma‛ĕl, Aḇraham’s
son, the sister of Neḇayoth, to be his wife, besides the wives he had. 
Gen
28:10  And Ya‛aqoḇ went out
from Be’ĕrsheḇa and went toward Ḥaran. 
Gen
28:11  And he came upon a place and
stopped over for the night, for the sun had set. And he took one of the stones
of that place and put it at his head, and he lay down in that place to sleep. 
Gen
28:12  And he dreamed and saw a ladder
set up on the earth, and its top reached to the heavens, and saw messengers of
Elohim going up and coming down on it. 
Gen
28:13  And see, יהוה
stood above it and said, “I am יהוה Elohim of Aḇraham
your father and the Elohim of Yitsḥaq. The land on which you are lying, I
give it to you and your seed. 
Gen
28:14  “And your seed shall be as the
dust of the earth, and you shall break forth to the west and to the east, to
the north and the south. And all the clans of the earth shall be blessed in you
and in your seed. 
Gen
28:15  “And see, I am with you and shall
guard you wherever you go, and shall bring you back to this land. For I am not
going to leave you until I have done what I have spoken to you.” 
Gen
28:16  And Ya‛aqoḇ awoke from
his sleep and said, “Truly, יהוה is in this place, and
I did not know it.” 
Gen
28:17  And he was afraid and said, “How
awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of Elohim, and this is
the gate of the heavens!” 
Gen
28:18  And Ya‛aqoḇ rose early
in the morning, and took the stone that he had put at his head, set it up as a
standing column, and poured oil on top of it. 
Gen
28:19  And he called the name of that
place Bĕyth Ĕl, however, the name of that city had been Luz
previously. 
Gen
28:20  And Ya‛aqoḇ made a
vow, saying, “Seeing Elohim is with me, and has kept me in this way that I am
going, and has given me bread to eat and a garment to put on – 
Gen
28:21  when I have returned to my father’s
house in peace, and יהוה has been my Elohim, 
Gen
28:22  then this stone which I have set
as a standing column shall be Elohim’s house, and of all that You give me, I
shall certainly give a tenth to You.” 
Gen
29:1  And Ya‛aqoḇ moved on
and came to the land of the people of the East. 
Gen
29:2  And he looked and saw a well in the
field, and saw three flocks of sheep lying by it, for out of that well they
watered the flocks, and a large stone was on the well’s mouth. 
Gen
29:3  And all the flocks would be
gathered there, then they would roll the stone from the well’s mouth and water
the sheep, and put the stone back in its place on the well’s mouth. 
Gen
29:4  So Ya‛aqoḇ said to
them, “My brothers, where are you from?” And they said, “We are from Ḥaran.”

Gen
29:5  And he said to them, “Do you know
Laḇan son of Naḥor?” And they said, “We know him.” 
Gen
29:6  So he said to them, “Is he well?”
And they said, “Well. And see, his daughter Raḥĕl is coming with the
sheep.” 
Gen
29:7  And he said, “See, it is still high
day, not the time for the livestock to be gathered together. Water the sheep,
and go and feed them.” 
Gen
29:8  But they said, “We are not allowed
until all the flocks are gathered together, and they have rolled the stone from
the well’s mouth, then we shall water the sheep.” 
Gen
29:9  While he was still speaking with
them, Raḥĕl came with her father’s sheep, for she was a shepherdess.

Gen
29:10  And it came to be, when Ya‛aqoḇ
saw Raḥĕl the daughter of Laḇan his mother’s brother, and the
sheep of Laḇan his mother’s brother, that Ya‛aqoḇ went near
and rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and watered the flock of Laḇan
his mother’s brother. 
Gen
29:11  And Ya‛aqoḇ kissed
Raḥĕl, and lifted up his voice and wept. 
Gen
29:12  And when Ya‛aqoḇ told
Raḥĕl that he was her father’s relative and that he was Riḇqah’s
son, she ran and told her father. 
Gen
29:13  And it came to be, when Laḇan
heard the report about Ya‛aqoḇ his sister’s son, that he ran to
meet him, and embraced him and kissed him, and brought him to his house. Then
he told Laḇan all these matters. 
Gen
29:14  And Laḇan said to him, “You
are indeed my bone and my flesh.” And he stayed with him for a month. 
Gen
29:15  Then Laḇan said to Ya‛aqoḇ,
“Because you are my relative, should you therefore serve me for naught? Let me
know, what should your wages be?” 
Gen
29:16  And Laḇan had two daughters,
the name of the elder was Lĕ’ah, and the name of the younger was Raḥĕl.

Gen
29:17  And Lĕ’ah’s eyes were weak,
but Raḥĕl was lovely of form and appearance. 
Gen
29:18  And Ya‛aqoḇ loved
Raḥĕl, so he said, “Let me serve you seven years for Raḥĕl
your younger daughter.” 
Gen
29:19  And Laḇan said, “It is
better that I give her to you than that I should give her to another man. Stay
with me.” 
Gen
29:20  So Ya‛aqoḇ served
seven years for Raḥĕl, and they seemed to him but a few days because
of the love he had for her. 
Gen
29:21  Then Ya‛aqoḇ said to
Laḇan, “Give me my wife, for my days are completed, and let me go in to
her.” 
Gen
29:22  And Laḇan gathered all the
men of the place and made a feast. 
Gen
29:23  And it came to be in the evening,
that he took Lĕ’ah his daughter and brought her to Ya‛aqoḇ.
And he went in to her. 
Gen
29:24  And Laḇan gave his female
servant Zilpah to his daughter Lĕ’ah as a female servant. 
Gen
29:25  And in the morning it came to be,
that see, it was Lĕ’ah. So he said to Laḇan, “What is this you have
done to me? Was it not for Raḥĕl that I served you? Why then have
you deceived me?” 
Gen
29:26  And Laḇan said, “It is not
done this way in our place, to give the younger before the first-born. 
Gen
29:27  “Complete the week of this one,
then we give you this one too, for the service which you shall serve with me
still another seven years.” 
Gen
29:28  And Ya‛aqoḇ did so and
completed her week. Then he gave him his daughter Raḥĕl too, as
wife. 
Gen
29:29  And Laḇan gave his female
servant Bilhah to his daughter Raḥĕl as a female servant. 
Gen
29:30  And he also went in to Raḥĕl,
and he also loved Raḥĕl more than Lĕ’ah. And he served with Laḇan
still another seven years. 
Gen
29:31  And יהוה
saw that Lĕ’ah was unloved, and He opened her womb, but Raḥĕl
was barren. 
Gen
29:32  And Lĕ’ah conceived and bore
a son, and she called his name Re’uḇĕn, for she said, “For יהוה
has looked on my affliction, because now my husband is going to love me.” 
Gen
29:33  And she conceived again and bore a
son, and said, “Because יהוה has heard that I am
unloved, He gave me this son too.” And she called his name Shim‛on. 
Gen
29:34  And she conceived again and bore a
son, and said, “Now this time my husband is joined to me, because I have borne
him three sons.” So his name was called Lĕwi. 
Gen
29:35  And she conceived again and bore a
son, and said, “Now I praise יהוה.” So she called his
name Yehuḏah. And she ceased bearing. 
Gen
30:1  And when Raḥĕl saw that
she bore Ya‛aqoḇ no children, Raḥĕl envied her sister,
and said to Ya‛aqoḇ, “Give me children, or else I am going to die!”

Gen
30:2  And Ya‛aqoḇ’s
displeasure burned against Raḥĕl, and he said, “Am I in the place of
Elohim, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?” 
Gen
30:3  And she said, “See, my female
servant Bilhah; go in to her, and let her bear for me, and let me be built up
from her as well.” 
Gen
30:4  So she gave him Bilhah her female
servant as wife, and Ya‛aqoḇ went in to her. 
Gen
30:5  And Bilhah conceived and bore Ya‛aqoḇ
a son. 
Gen
30:6  And Raḥĕl said, “Elohim
has rightly ruled my case, and has also heard my voice and given me a son.” So
she called his name Dan. 
Gen
30:7  And Raḥĕl’s female
servant Bilhah conceived again and bore Ya‛aqoḇ a second son. 
Gen
30:8  And Raḥĕl said, “With
great wrestlings I have wrestled with my sister, and I have overcome.” So she
called his name Naphtali. 
Gen
30:9  And Lĕ’ah saw that she had
ceased bearing, and she took Zilpah her female servant and gave her to Ya‛aqoḇ
as wife. 
Gen
30:10  And Lĕ’ah’s female servant
Zilpah bore Ya‛aqoḇ a son. 
Gen
30:11  And Lĕ’ah said, “With Gaḏ!”
So she called his name Gaḏ. 
Gen
30:12  And Lĕ’ah’s female servant
Zilpah bore Ya‛aqoḇ a second son. 
Gen
30:13  And Lĕ’ah said, “I am
blessed, for the daughters shall call me blessed.” So she called his name Ashĕr.

Gen
30:14  And Re’uḇĕn went in the
days of wheat harvest and found love-apples in the field, and brought them to
his mother Lĕ’ah. And Raḥĕl said to Lĕ’ah, “Please give me
some of your son’s love-apples.” 
Gen
30:15  But she said to her, “Is it a
small matter that you have taken away my husband? Would you take away my son’s
love-apples too?” And Raḥĕl said, “Therefore let him lie with you
tonight for your son’s love-apples.” 
Gen
30:16  And when Ya‛aqoḇ came
out of the field in the evening, Lĕ’ah went out to meet him and said, “Do
come in to me, for indeed, I have hired you with my son’s love-apples.” And he
lay with her that night. 
Gen
30:17  And Elohim listened to Lĕ’ah,
and she conceived and bore Ya‛aqoḇ a fifth son. 
Gen
30:18  And Lĕ’ah said, “Elohim has
given me my hire, because I have given my female servant to my husband.” So she
called his name Yissasḵar. 
Gen
30:19  And Lĕ’ah conceived again and
bore Ya‛aqoḇ a sixth son. 
Gen
30:20  And Lĕ’ah said, “Elohim has
presented me with a good present. Now my husband is going to dwell with me,
because I have borne him six sons.” So she called his name Zeḇulun. 
Gen
30:21  And afterward she bore a daughter,
and called her name Dinah. 
Gen
30:22  And Elohim remembered Raḥĕl,
and Elohim listened to her and opened her womb. 
Gen
30:23  And she conceived, and bore a son,
and said, “Elohim has taken away my reproach.” 
Gen
30:24  So she called his name Yosĕph,
and said, “ יהוה has added to me another son.” 
Gen
30:25  And it came to be, when Raḥĕl
had borne Yosĕph, that Ya‛aqoḇ said to Laḇan, “Send me
on my way, to go to my own place and to my land. 
Gen
30:26  “Give my wives and my children for
whom I have served you, and let me go, for you yourself know my service which I
have done for you.” 
Gen
30:27  And Laḇan said to him, “If I
have found favour in your eyes, please stay, for I have diligently watched that
יהוה has blessed me for your sake.” 
Gen
30:28  And he said, “Name me your wages,
and I give it.” 
Gen
30:29  So he said to him, “You know how I
have served you and how your livestock has been with me. 
Gen
30:30  “For the little you had before I
came has increased greatly, and יהוה has blessed you
since my coming. But now, when am I to provide for my own house too?” 
Gen
30:31  And he said, “What do I give you?”
And Ya‛aqoḇ said, “Give me naught! If you do this for me, I shall
again feed and guard your flocks: 
Gen
30:32  “Let me pass through all your
flock today, removing from there all the speckled and spotted sheep, and all
the black ones among the lambs, and the spotted and speckled among the goats.
And these shall be my wages. 
Gen
30:33  “And my righteousness shall answer
for me in time to come, when you come concerning my wages: every one that is
not speckled and spotted among the goats, and black among the lambs, it is
stolen if it is with me.” 
Gen
30:34  And Laḇan said, “See, let it
be according to your word!” 
Gen
30:35  And on that day he set aside the
male goats that were speckled and spotted, and all the female goats that were
speckled and spotted, every one that had some white in it, and all the black
ones among the lambs, and gave them into the hand of his sons. 
Gen
30:36  And he put three days’ journey
between himself and Ya‛aqoḇ, and Ya‛aqoḇ fed the rest
of Laḇan’s flocks. 
Gen
30:37  And Ya‛aqoḇ took for
himself rods of green poplar and of the almond and chestnut trees, peeled white
strips in them, and exposed the white which was in the rods. 
Gen
30:38  And he set the rods which he had
peeled before the flocks in the gutters, in the watering troughs where the
flocks came to drink, and they conceived when they came to drink. 
Gen
30:39  So the flocks conceived before the
rods, and the flocks brought forth streaked, speckled, and spotted. 
Gen
30:40  And Ya‛aqoḇ separated
the lambs, and made the flocks face toward the streaked and all the black in
the flock of Laḇan, but he put his own flocks by themselves and did not
put them with Laḇan’s flock. 
Gen
30:41  And it came to be, whenever the
strong ones of the flock conceived, that Ya‛aqoḇ placed the rods
before the eyes of the flock in the gutters, so they would conceive among the
rods. 
Gen
30:42  But when the flocks were weak, he
did not put them in, so the weak ones were Laḇan’s and the strong ones Ya‛aqoḇ’s.

Gen
30:43  Thus the man increased very much,
and had many flocks, and female and male servants, and camels and donkeys. 
Gen
31:1  And he heard the words of Laḇan’s
sons, saying, “Ya‛aqoḇ has taken away all that was our father’s,
and from what belonged to our father he has made all this wealth.” 
Gen
31:2  And Ya‛aqoḇ would look
at the face of Laḇan and see that it was not toward him as before. 
Gen
31:3  And יהוה
said to Ya‛aqoḇ, “Return to the land of your fathers and to your
relatives. And I am with you.” 
Gen
31:4  And Ya‛aqoḇ sent and
called Raḥĕl and Lĕ’ah to the field, to his flock, 
Gen
31:5  and said to them, “I see your
father’s face, that it is not toward me as before, but the Elohim of my father
has been with me. 
Gen
31:6  “And you know that I have served
your father with all my strength. 
Gen
31:7  “Yet your father has deceived me
and changed my wages ten times, but Elohim did not allow him to do evil to me. 
Gen
31:8  “When he said this, ‘The speckled
are your wages,’ then all the flocks bore speckled. And when he said this, ‘The
streaked are your wages,’ then all the flocks bore streaked. 
Gen
31:9  “So Elohim has taken away the
livestock of your father and given them to me. 
Gen
31:10  “And it came to be, at the time
when the flocks conceived, that I lifted my eyes and looked in a dream and saw
the rams which leaped upon the flocks were streaked, speckled, and mottled. 
Gen
31:11  “And the Messenger of Elohim spoke
to me in a dream, saying, ‘Ya‛aqoḇ.’ And I said, ‘Here I am.’ 
Gen
31:12  “And He said, ‘Lift your eyes now
and see, all the rams which leap on the flocks are streaked, speckled, and
mottled, for I have seen all that Laḇan is doing to you. 
Gen
31:13  ‘I am the Ĕl of Bĕyth Ĕl,
where you anointed the standing column and where you made a vow to Me. Now rise
up, get out of this land, and return to the land of your relatives.’ ” 
Gen
31:14  And Raḥĕl and Lĕ’ah
answered and said to him, “Do we still have any portion or inheritance in our
father’s house? 
Gen
31:15  “Are we not reckoned by him as
strangers? For he has sold us, and also entirely consumed our silver. 
Gen
31:16  “For all the wealth which Elohim
has taken from our father are ours and our children’s. Now then, do whatever
Elohim has told you.” 
Gen
31:17  So Ya‛aqoḇ rose and
put his sons and his wives on camels, 
Gen
31:18  and he drove off all his livestock
and all his possessions which he had acquired, his property of the livestock
which he had acquired in Paddan Aram, to go to his father Yitsḥaq in the
land of Kena‛an. 
Gen
31:19  And when Laḇan had gone to
shear his sheep, Raḥĕl stole the house idols that were her father’s.

Gen
31:20  And Ya‛aqoḇ deceived
Laḇan the Aramean, because he did not inform him that he was about to
flee. 
Gen
31:21  And he fled with all that he had.
And he rose up and passed over the river, and headed toward the mountains of
Gil‛aḏ. 
Gen
31:22  And on the third day Laḇan
was told that Ya‛aqoḇ had fled. 
Gen
31:23  Then he took his brothers with him
and pursued him for seven days’ journey, and he overtook him in the mountains
of Gil‛aḏ. 
Gen
31:24  But in a dream by night Elohim
came to Laḇan the Aramean, and said to him, “Guard yourself, that you do
not speak to Ya‛aqoḇ either good or evil.” 
Gen
31:25  Then Laḇan overtook Ya‛aqoḇ.
Now Ya‛aqoḇ had pitched his tent in the mountains, and Laḇan
with his brothers pitched in the mountains of Gil‛aḏ. 
Gen
31:26  And Laḇan said to Ya‛aqoḇ,
“What have you done, that you have deceived me, and driven my daughters off
like captives taken with the sword? 
Gen
31:27  “Why did you flee secretly and
deceive me, and not inform me, and I would have sent you away with joy and
songs, with tambourine and lyre? 
Gen
31:28  “And you did not allow me to kiss
my sons and my daughters. Now you have been foolish to do this. 
Gen
31:29  “It is in the power of my hand to
do evil to you, but the Elohim of your father spoke to me last night, saying, ‘Guard
yourself, that you do not speak to Ya‛aqoḇ either good or evil.’ 
Gen
31:30  “And now you have gone because you
greatly long for your father’s house, but why did you steal my mighty ones?” 
Gen
31:31  And Ya‛aqoḇ answered
and said to Laḇan, “Because I was afraid, for I said, ‘Lest you tear your
daughters away from me.’ 
Gen
31:32  “With whomever you find your
mighty ones, do not let him live. In the presence of our brothers, see for
yourself what is with me and take it with you.” For Ya‛aqoḇ did not
know that Raḥĕl had stolen them. 
Gen
31:33  And Laḇan went into Ya‛aqoḇ’s
tent, and into Lĕ’ah’s tent, and into the tents of the two female
servants, but he did not find them. And he came out of Lĕ’ah’s tent and
entered Raḥĕl’s tent. 
Gen
31:34  Now Raḥĕl had taken the
house idols and put them in the camel’s saddle, and sat on them. And Laḇan
searched all about the tent but did not find them. 
Gen
31:35  And she said to her father, “Let
it not displease my master that I am unable to rise before you, for the way of
women is with me.” And he searched but did not find the house idols. 
Gen
31:36  And Ya‛aqoḇ was wroth
and contended with Laḇan, and Ya‛aqoḇ answered and said to Laḇan,
“What is my transgression? What is my sin, that you have hotly pursued me? 
Gen
31:37  “Now that you have searched all my
goods what have you found of all your household goods? Set it here before my
brothers and your brothers, and let them decide between the two of us! 
Gen
31:38  “These twenty years I have been
with you. Your ewes and your female goats have not miscarried their young, and
I have not eaten the rams of your sheep. 
Gen
31:39  “That which was torn by beasts I
did not bring to you, I myself bore the loss of it. You required it from my
hand, whether stolen by day or stolen by night. 
Gen
31:40  “Thus I was! By day the heat consumed me, and the frost by night,
and my sleep fled from my eyes. 
Gen
31:41  “These twenty years I have been in
your house. I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years
for your flock, and you have changed my wages ten times. 
Gen
31:42  “Unless the Elohim of my father,
the Elohim of Aḇraham and the Fear of Yitsḥaq, had been with me,
you would now have sent me away empty-handed. Elohim has seen my affliction and
the labour of my hands, and rendered judgment last night.” 
Gen
31:43  And Laḇan answered and said
to Ya‛aqoḇ, “These daughters are my daughters, and these children
are my children, and this flock is my flock, and all that you see is mine. But
what shall I do today to these, my daughters or to their children whom they
have borne? 
Gen
31:44  “And now, come, let us make a
covenant, you and I, and it shall be a witness between you and me.” 
Gen
31:45  So Ya‛aqoḇ took a
stone and set it up as a standing column. 
Gen
31:46  And Ya‛aqoḇ said to
his brothers, “Gather stones.” And they took stones and made a heap, and they
ate there on the heap. 
Gen
31:47  And Laḇan called it Yeḡar
Sahaḏutha, but Ya‛aqoḇ called it Gal‛ĕḏ. 
Gen
31:48  And Laḇan said, “This heap
is a witness between you and me today.” That is why its name was called Gal‛ĕḏ,

Gen
31:49  also Mitspah, because he said, “Let
יהוה watch between you and me when we are out of each
other’s sight. 
Gen
31:50  “If you afflict my daughters, or
if you take other wives besides my daughters, although no man is with us; see,
Elohim is witness between you and me!” 
Gen
31:51  And Laḇan said to Ya‛aqoḇ,
“See this heap and see this standing column, which I have placed between you
and me. 
Gen
31:52  “This heap is a witness, and this
standing column is a witness, that I do not pass beyond this heap to you, and
you do not pass beyond this heap and this standing column to me, for evil. 
Gen
31:53  “The Elohim of Aḇraham, the
Elohim of Naḥor, and the Elohim of their father rightly rule between us!”
And Ya‛aqoḇ swore by the Fear of his father Yitsḥaq. 
Gen
31:54  And Ya‛aqoḇ brought an
offering on the mountain, and called his brothers to eat bread. And they ate
bread and spent the night on the mountain. 
Gen
31:55  And Laḇan rose up early in
the morning, and kissed his sons and daughters and blessed them. And Laḇan
left and returned to his place. 
Gen
32:1  And Ya‛aqoḇ went on his
way, and the messengers of Elohim met him. 
Gen
32:2  And when Ya‛aqoḇ saw them,
he said, “This is the camp of Elohim.” And he called the name of that place
Maḥanayim. 
Gen
32:3  And Ya‛aqoḇ sent
messengers before him to Ĕsaw his brother in the land of Sĕ‛ir,
the field of Eḏom 
Gen
32:4  and he commanded them, saying, “Say
this to my master Ĕsaw, ‘Your servant Ya‛aqoḇ said this, “I
have sojourned with Laḇan and stayed there until now. 
Gen
32:5  “And I have bulls, and donkeys,
flocks, and male and female servants. And I have sent to inform my master, to
find favour in your eyes.” ’ ” 
Gen
32:6  So the messengers returned to Ya‛aqoḇ,
saying, “We came to your brother Ĕsaw, and he also is coming to meet you,
and four hundred men with him.” 
Gen
32:7  And Ya‛aqoḇ was greatly
afraid and distressed. So he divided the people that were with him, and the
flocks and herds and camels, into two groups, 
Gen
32:8  and he said, “If Ĕsaw comes to
the one group and attacks it, then the other group which is left shall escape.”

Gen
32:9  And Ya‛aqoḇ said, “O
Elohim of my father Aḇraham and Elohim of my father Yitsḥaq, יהוה
who said to me, ‘Return to your land and to your relatives, and I do good to
you,’ 
Gen
32:10  “I do not deserve the least of all
the kind acts and all the truth which You have shown Your servant, for I passed
over this Yardĕn with my staff, and now I have become two groups. 
Gen
32:11  “Deliver me, I pray, from the hand
of my brother, from the hand of Ĕsaw, for I fear him, lest he come and
shall smite me and the mother with the children. 
Gen
32:12  “For You said, ‘I shall certainly
do good to you, and shall make your seed as the sand of the sea, which are too
numerous to count.’ ” 
Gen
32:13  And he spent the night there, and
took what came to his hand as a present for Ĕsaw his brother – 
Gen
32:14  two hundred female goats and
twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams, 
Gen
32:15  thirty milk camels with their
colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten foals. 
Gen
32:16  And he gave into the hand of his
servants, every drove by itself, and said to his servants, “Pass over before
me, and put some distance between drove and drove.” 
Gen
32:17  And he commanded the first one,
saying, “When Ĕsaw my brother meets you and asks you, saying, ‘To whom do
you belong, and where are you going? And whose are these in front of you?’ 
Gen
32:18  then you shall say, ‘They are your
servant Ya‛aqoḇ’s. It is a present sent to my master Ĕsaw. And
see, he also is behind us.’ ” 
Gen
32:19  So he commanded the second, and
the third, and all who followed the droves, saying, “Speak to Ĕsaw this
same word when you find him, 
Gen
32:20  and you shall say, ‘Also look,
your servant Ya‛aqoḇ is behind us.’ ” For he said, “Let me appease
him with the present that goes before me, and after that see his face. He might
accept me.” 
Gen
32:21  And the present passed over before
him, but he himself spent the night in the camp. 
Gen
32:22  And he rose up that night and took
his two wives, and his two female servants, and his eleven sons, and passed
over the ford of Yabboq. 
Gen
32:23  And he took them and sent them
over the stream, and sent over what he had. 
Gen
32:24  And Ya‛aqoḇ was left
alone. And a Man wrestled with him until the breaking of day. 
Gen
32:25  And when He saw that He did not
overcome him, He touched the socket of his hip. And the socket of Ya‛aqoḇ’s
hip was dislocated as He wrestled with him. 
Gen
32:26  And He said, “Let Me go, for the
day breaks.” But he said, “I am not letting You go until You have blessed me!” 
Gen
32:27  So He asked him, “What is your
name?” And he said, “Ya‛aqoḇ.” 
Gen
32:28  And He said, “Your name is no
longer called Ya‛aqoḇ, but Yisra’ĕl, because you have striven
with Elohim and with men, and have overcome.”
Gen
32:29  And Ya‛aqoḇ asked Him,
saying, “Please let me know Your Name.” And He said, “Why do you ask about My
Name?” And He blessed him there. 
Gen
32:30  And Ya‛aqoḇ called the
name of the place Peni’ĕl, “For I have seen Elohim face to face, and my
life is preserved.” 
Gen
32:31  And the sun rose on him as he
passed over Penu’ĕl, and he limped on his hip. 
Gen
32:32  That is why the children of Yisra’ĕl
to this day do not eat the sinew of the hip, which is on the socket of the
thigh, because He touched the socket of the thigh of Ya‛aqoḇ, in
the sinew of the hip. 
Gen
33:1  And Ya‛aqoḇ lifted his
eyes and looked and saw Ĕsaw coming, and with him four hundred men. And he
divided the children among Lĕ’ah, and Raḥĕl, and the two female
servants. 
Gen
33:2  And he put the female servants and
their children in front, and Lĕ’ah and her children behind, and Raḥĕl
and Yosĕph last.
Gen
33:3  And he himself passed over before
them and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his
brother. 
Gen
33:4  And Ĕsaw ran to meet him, and
embraced him, and fell on his neck and kissed him, and they wept. 
Gen
33:5  And he lifted his eyes and saw the
women and children, and said, “Who are these with you?” And he said, “The
children with whom Elohim has favoured your servant.” 
Gen
33:6  Then the female servants came near,
they and their children, and bowed themselves. 
Gen
33:7  And Lĕ’ah also came near with
her children, and they bowed themselves. And Yosĕph and Raḥĕl
came near, and they bowed themselves. 
Gen
33:8  Then Ĕsaw said, “What do you mean
by all this company which I met?” And he said, “To find favour in the eyes of
my master.” 
Gen
33:9  But Ĕsaw said, “I have enough,
my brother, let what you have remain yours.” 
Gen
33:10  And Ya‛aqoḇ said, “No,
please, if I have now found favour in your eyes, then receive my present from
my hand, because I have seen your face like seeing the face of Elohim, and you
were pleased with me. 
Gen
33:11  “Please, take my blessing that is
brought to you, because Elohim has favoured me, and because I have all I need.” And he urged him, and he took
it. 
Gen
33:12  And he said, “Let us depart and
go, and let me go before you.” 
Gen
33:13  But he said to him, “My master
knows that the children are weak, and the flocks and herds which are nursing
are with me. And if the men should drive them hard one day, all the flocks
shall die. 
Gen
33:14  “Please let my master go before
his servant, and let me lead on slowly according to the pace of the livestock
that go before me, and according to the pace of the children, until I come to
my master in Sĕ‛ir.” 
Gen
33:15  And Ĕsaw said, “Please let me
leave with you some of the people who are with me.” But he said, “Why this? Let
me find favour in the eyes of my master.” 
Gen
33:16  And Ĕsaw returned that day on
his way to Sĕ‛ir. 
Gen
33:17  And Ya‛aqoḇ set out to
Sukkoth, and built himself a house, and made booths for his livestock. That is
why the name of the place is called Sukkoth. 
Gen
33:18  And Ya‛aqoḇ came
safely to the city of Sheḵem, which is in the land of Kena‛an, when
he came from Paddan Aram. And he pitched his tent before the city. 
Gen
33:19  And he bought the portion of the
field where he had pitched his tent, from the children of Ḥamor, Sheḵem’s
father, for one hundred qesitah. 
Gen
33:20  And he set up an altar there and
called it Ĕl Elohĕ Yisra’ĕl. 
Gen
34:1  And Dinah, the daughter of Lĕ’ah,
whom she had borne to Ya‛aqoḇ, went out to see the daughters of the
land. 
Gen
34:2  And Sheḵem, son of Ḥamor
the Ḥiwwite, prince of the land, saw her and took her and lay with her,
and humbled her. 
Gen
34:3  And his being clung to Dinah the
daughter of Ya‛aqoḇ, and he loved the girl and spoke kindly to the
girl. 
Gen
34:4  And Sheḵem spoke to his
father Ḥamor, saying, “Take this girl for me for a wife.” 
Gen
34:5  And Ya‛aqoḇ heard that
he had defiled Dinah his daughter. Now his sons were with his livestock in the
field, so Ya‛aqoḇ kept silent until they came. 
Gen
34:6  And Ḥamor, the father of Sheḵem,
went out to Ya‛aqoḇ to speak with him. 
Gen
34:7  And the sons of Ya‛aqoḇ
came in from the field when they heard it. And the men were grieved and very
wroth, because he had done a senseless deed in Yisra’ĕl by lying with Ya‛aqoḇ’s
daughter, which should not be done. 
Gen
34:8  But Ḥamor spoke with them,
saying, “My son Sheḵem’s being longs for your daughter. Please give her
to him for a wife. 
Gen
34:9  “And intermarry with us, give us
your daughters and take our daughters for yourselves, 
Gen
34:10  and dwell with us, and let the
land be before you. Dwell and move about in it, and have possessions in it.” 
Gen
34:11  And Sheḵem said to her
father and her brothers, “Let me find favour in your eyes, and whatever you say
to me I give. 
Gen
34:12  “Ask of me a bride price and gift
ever so high, and I give according to what you say to me, but give me the girl
for a wife.” 
Gen
34:13  But the sons of Ya‛aqoḇ
answered Sheḵem and Ḥamor his father, and spoke with deceit,
because he had defiled Dinah their sister. 
Gen
34:14  And they said to them, “We are not
able to do this matter, to give our sister to one who is uncircumcised, for
that would be a reproach to us. 
Gen
34:15  “Only on this condition would we agree to you: If you become as we are, to have
every male of you circumcised, 
Gen
34:16  then we shall give our daughters
to you, and take your daughters to us. And we shall dwell with you, and shall
become one people. 
Gen
34:17  “But if you do not listen to us
and be circumcised, we shall take our daughter and go.” 
Gen
34:18  And their words pleased Ḥamor
and Sheḵem, Ḥamor’s son. 
Gen
34:19  And the young man did not delay to
do this because he delighted in Ya‛aqoḇ’s daughter. Now he was more
respected than all the household of his father. 
Gen
34:20  And Ḥamor and Sheḵem
his son came to the gate of their city, and spoke with the men of their city,
saying, 
Gen
34:21  “These men are at peace with us,
so let them dwell in the land and move about in it. And see, the land is large
enough for them. Let us take their daughters for us for wives, and let us give
them our daughters. 
Gen
34:22  “Only on this condition would the men agree to dwell with us, to be one people:
if every male among us is circumcised as they are circumcised. 
Gen
34:23  “Their herds and their
possessions, and all their beasts, should they not be ours? Only let us agree
with them, and let them dwell with us.” 
Gen
34:24  And all who went out of the gate
of his city listened to Ḥamor and Sheḵem his son; every male was
circumcised, all who went out of the gate of his city. 
Gen
34:25  And it came to be on the third
day, when they were in pain, that two of the sons of Ya‛aqoḇ, Shim‛on
and Lĕwi, Dinah’s brothers, each took his sword and came boldly upon the
city and killed all the males. 
Gen
34:26  And they killed Ḥamor and
Sheḵem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah from Sheḵem’s
house, and went out. 
Gen
34:27  The sons of Ya‛aqoḇ
came upon the slain, and plundered the city, because they had defiled their
sister. 
Gen
34:28  They took their flocks and their
herds, and their donkeys, and that which was in the city and that which was in
the field, 
Gen
34:29  and all their wealth. And all
their little ones and their wives they took captive, and they plundered all
that was in the houses. 
Gen
34:30  And Ya‛aqoḇ said to
Shim‛on and Lĕwi, “You have troubled me by making me a stench among
the inhabitants of the land, among the Kena‛anites and the Perizzites.
And I am few in number, they shall gather themselves against me and shall smite
me, and I shall be destroyed, my household and I.” 
Gen
34:31  But they said, “Should he treat
our sister like a whore?” 
Gen
35:1  And Elohim said to Ya‛aqoḇ,
“Arise, go up to Bĕyth Ĕl and dwell there. And make an altar there to
Ĕl who appeared to you when you fled from the face of Ĕsaw your
brother.” 
Gen
35:2  And Ya‛aqoḇ said to his
household and to all who were with him, “Put away the foreign mighty ones that
are among you, and cleanse yourselves, and change your garments. 
Gen
35:3  “And let us arise and go up to Bĕyth
Ĕl, and let me make there an altar to Ĕl, who answered me in the day
of my distress, and has been with me in the way which I have gone.” 
Gen
35:4  So they gave Ya‛aqoḇ
all the foreign mighty ones which were in their hands, and all their earrings
which were in their ears. And Ya‛aqoḇ hid them under the terebinth
tree which was near Sheḵem. 
Gen
35:5  And they departed, and the fear of
Elohim was upon the cities that were all around them, and they did not pursue
the sons of Ya‛aqoḇ. 
Gen
35:6  And Ya‛aqoḇ came to
Luz, that is Bĕyth Ĕl, which is in the land of Kena‛an, he and
all the people who were with him. 
Gen
35:7  And he built there an altar and
called the place El Bĕyth Ĕl, because there Elohim appeared to him
when he fled from the face of his brother. 
Gen
35:8  And Deḇorah, Riḇqah’s
nurse, died, and she was buried below Bĕyth Ĕl under the terebinth
tree. So the name of it was called Allon Baḵuth. 
Gen
35:9  And Elohim appeared to Ya‛aqoḇ
again, when he came from Paddan Aram, and blessed him. 
Gen
35:10  And Elohim said to him, “Your name
is Ya‛aqoḇ, your name is no longer called Ya‛aqoḇ, but
Yisra’ĕl is your name.” So He called his name Yisra’ĕl. 
Gen
35:11  And Elohim said to him, “I am Ĕl
Shaddai. Bear fruit and increase, a nation and a company of nations shall be
from you, and sovereigns come from your body. 
Gen
35:12  “And the land which I gave Aḇraham
and Yitsḥaq I give to you. And to your seed after you I give this land.” 
Gen
35:13  And Elohim went up from him in the
place where He had spoken with him. 
Gen
35:14  And Ya‛aqoḇ set up a
standing column in the place where He had spoken with him, a monument of stone.
And he poured a drink offering on it, and he poured oil on it. 
Gen
35:15  And Ya‛aqoḇ called the
name of the place where Elohim spoke with him, Bĕyth Ĕl. 
Gen
35:16  Then they set out from Bĕyth Ĕl.
And it came to be, when there was but a little distance to go to Ephrath, that
Raḥĕl began to give birth, and had great difficulty giving birth. 
Gen
35:17  And it came to be, as she was
having great difficulty giving birth, that the midwife said to her, “Do not
fear, for it is another son for you.” 
Gen
35:18  And it came to be, as her life was
going out – for she died – that she called his name Ben-Oni. But his father
called him Binyamin. 
Gen
35:19  So Raḥĕl died and was
buried on the way to Ephrath, that is Bĕyth Leḥem. 
Gen
35:20  And Ya‛aqoḇ set a
standing column on her grave, which is the monument of Raḥĕl’s grave
to this day. 
Gen
35:21  And Yisra’ĕl set out and
pitched his tent beyond the tower of Ĕḏer. 
Gen
35:22  And it came to be, when Yisra’ĕl
dwelt in that land, that Re’uḇĕn went and lay with Bilhah his father’s
concubine. And Yisra’ĕl heard about it. Now the sons of Ya‛aqoḇ
were twelve: 
Gen
35:23  the sons of Lĕ’ah were Re’uḇĕn,
Ya‛aqoḇ’s first-born, and Shim‛on, and Lĕwi, and Yehuḏah,
and Yissasḵar, and Zeḇulun; 
Gen
35:24  the sons of Raḥĕl were
Yosĕph and Binyamin; 
Gen
35:25  the sons of Bilhah, Raḥĕl’s
female servant, were Dan and Naphtali; 
Gen
35:26  and the sons of Zilpah, Lĕ’ah’s
female servant, were Gaḏ and Ashĕr. These were the sons of Ya‛aqoḇ
who were born to him in Paddan Aram. 
Gen
35:27  And Ya‛aqoḇ came to
his father Yitsḥaq at Mamrĕ, or Qiryath Arba, that is Ḥeḇron,
where Aḇraham and Yitsḥaq had dwelt. 
Gen
35:28  And the days of Yitsḥaq were
one hundred and eighty years. 
Gen
35:29  So Yitsḥaq breathed his last
and died, and was gathered to his people, aged and satisfied of days. And his
sons Ĕsaw and Ya‛aqoḇ buried him. 
Gen
36:1  And this is the genealogy of Ĕsaw,
who is Eḏom. 
Gen
36:2  Ĕsaw took his wives from the
daughters of Kena‛an: Aḏah the daughter of Ĕlon the Ḥittite,
and Oholiḇamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Tsiḇ‛on
the Ḥiwwite; 
Gen
36:3  and Basemath, Yishma‛ĕl’s
daughter, sister of Neḇayoth. 
Gen
36:4  And Aḏah bore Eliphaz to Ĕsaw,
and Basemath bore Re‛uw’ĕl. 
Gen
36:5  And Oholiḇamah bore Ye‛ush,
and Ya‛lam, and Qoraḥ. These were the sons of Ĕsaw who were
born to him in the land of Kena‛an. 
Gen
36:6  And Ĕsaw took his wives, and
his sons, and his daughters, and all the beings of his household, and his herds
and all his beasts, and all his possessions which he had gained in the land of
Kena‛an, and went to a land away from the presence of his brother Ya‛aqoḇ.

Gen
36:7  For their possessions were too
great for them to dwell together, and the land of their sojournings could not
support them because of their herds. 
Gen
36:8  So Ĕsaw dwelt in Mount Sĕ‛ir.
Ĕsaw is Eḏom. 
Gen
36:9  And this is the genealogy of Ĕsaw
the father of the Eḏomites in Mount Sĕ‛ir. 
Gen
36:10  These were the names of Ĕsaw’s
sons: Eliphaz son of Aḏah, wife of Ĕsaw, and Re‛uw’ĕl son
of Basemath, wife of Ĕsaw. 
Gen
36:11  And the sons of Eliphaz were Tĕman,
Omar, Tsepho, and Gatam, and Qenaz. 
Gen
36:12  And Timna was the concubine of
Eliphaz, Ĕsaw’s son, and she bore Amalĕq to Eliphaz. These were the
sons of Aḏah, Ĕsaw’s wife. 
Gen
36:13  These were the sons of Re‛uw’ĕl:
Naḥath and Zeraḥ, Shammah and Mizzah. These were the sons of
Basemath, Ĕsaw’s wife. 
Gen
36:14  These were the sons of Oholiḇamah,
Ĕsaw’s wife, the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Tsiḇ‛on.
And she bore to Ĕsaw: Ye‛ush, and Ya‛lam, and Qoraḥ. 
Gen
36:15  These were the chiefs of the sons
of Ĕsaw. The sons of Eliphaz, the first-born son of Ĕsaw, were Chief
Tĕman, Chief Omar, Chief Tsepho, Chief Qenaz, 
Gen
36:16  Chief Qoraḥ, Chief Gatam,
Chief Amalĕq. These were the chiefs of Eliphaz in the land of Eḏom.
They were the sons of Aḏah. 
Gen
36:17  And these were the sons of Re‛uw’ĕl,
Ĕsaw’s son: Chief Naḥath, Chief Zeraḥ, Chief Shammah, and
Chief Mizzah. These were the chiefs of Re‛uw’ĕl in the land of Eḏom.
These were the sons of Basemath, Ĕsaw’s wife. 
Gen
36:18  And these were the sons of Oholiḇamah,
Ĕsaw’s wife: Chief Ye‛ush, Chief Ya‛lam, and Chief Qoraḥ.
These were the chiefs descending from
Oholiḇamah, Ĕsaw’s wife, the daughter of Anah. 
Gen
36:19  These were the sons of Ĕsaw,
who is Eḏom, and these were their chiefs. 
Gen
36:20  These were the sons of Sĕ‛ir
the Ḥorite who inhabited the land: Lotan, and Shoḇal, and Tsiḇ‛on,
and Anah, 
Gen
36:21  and Dishon, and Ĕtser, and
Dishan. These were the chiefs of the Ḥorites, the sons of Sĕ‛ir,
in the land of Eḏom. 
Gen
36:22  And the sons of Lotan were Ḥori
and Hĕmam. Lotan’s sister was Timna. 
Gen
36:23  And these were the sons of Shoḇal:
Alwan, and Manaḥath, and Ĕyḇal, Shepho, and Onam. 
Gen
36:24  And these were the sons of Tsiḇ‛on:
both Ayah and Anah. This was the Anah who found the water in the wilderness as
he fed the donkeys of his father Tsiḇ‛on. 
Gen
36:25  And these were the children of
Anah: Dishon and Oholiḇamah the daughter of Anah. 
Gen
36:26  And these were the sons of Dishon:
Ḥemdan, and Eshban, and Yithran, and Keran. 
Gen
36:27  These were the sons of Ĕtser:
Bilhan, and Za‛awan, and Aqan. 
Gen
36:28  These were the sons of Dishan: Uts
and Aran. 
Gen
36:29  These were the chiefs of the Ḥorites:
Chief Lotan, Chief Shoḇal, Chief Tsiḇ‛on, Chief Anah, 
Gen
36:30  Chief Dishon, Chief Ĕtser,
and Chief Dishan. These were the chiefs of the Ḥorites, according to
their chiefs in the land of Sĕ‛ir. 
Gen
36:31  And these were the sovereigns who
reigned in the land of Eḏom before any sovereign reigned over the
children of Yisra’ĕl. 
Gen
36:32  And Bela the son of Be‛or
reigned in Eḏom, and the name of his city was Dinhaḇah. 
Gen
36:33  And Bela died, and Yoḇaḇ
son of Zeraḥ of Botsrah reigned in his place. 
Gen
36:34  And Yoḇaḇ died, and Ḥusham
of the land of the Tĕmanites reigned in his place. 
Gen
36:35  And Ḥusham died, and Haḏaḏ
son of Beḏaḏ, who smote Miḏyan in the field of Mo’aḇ,
reigned in his place. And the name of his city was Awith. 
Gen
36:36  And Haḏaḏ died, and
Samlah of Masrĕqah reigned in his place. 
Gen
36:37  And Samlah died, and Sha’ul of
Reḥoḇoth by the River reigned in his place. 
Gen
36:38  And Sha’ul died, and Ba‛al-Ḥanan
son of Aḵbor reigned in his place. 
Gen
36:39  And Ba‛al-Ḥanan son of
Aḵbor died, and Haḏar reigned in his place. And the name of his
city was Pa‛u. And his wife’s name was Mehĕtab’ĕl, the daughter
of Matrĕḏ, the daughter of Mĕyzahaḇ. 
Gen
36:40  And these were the names of the
chiefs of Ĕsaw, according to their clans and their places, by their names:
Chief Timnah, Chief Alwah, Chief Yethĕth, 
Gen
36:41  Chief Oholiḇamah, Chief Ĕlah,
Chief Pinon, 
Gen
36:42  Chief Qenaz, Chief Tĕman,
Chief Miḇtsar, 
Gen
36:43  Chief Maḡdi’ĕl, Chief
Iram. These were the chiefs of Eḏom, according to their dwelling places
in the land of their possession. Ĕsaw was the father of the Eḏomites.

Gen
37:1  And Ya‛aqoḇ dwelt in
the land of his father’s sojournings, in the land of Kena‛an. 
Gen
37:2  This is the genealogy of Ya‛aqoḇ.
Yosĕph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his
brothers. And the young man was with the sons of Bilhah and the sons of Zilpah,
his father’s wives. And Yosĕph brought an evil report of them to his
father. 
Gen
37:3  And Yisra’ĕl loved Yosĕph
more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age. And he made
him a long robe. 
Gen
37:4  But when his brothers saw that
their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him and were not
able to speak peaceably to him. 
Gen
37:5  And Yosĕph dreamed a dream,
and told it to his brothers. So they hated him even more. 
Gen
37:6  And he said to them, “Please listen
to this dream which I have dreamed: 
Gen
37:7  “See, we were binding sheaves in
the midst of the field, and see, my sheaf rose up and also stood up. And see,
your sheaves stood all around and bowed down to my sheaf.” 
Gen
37:8  And his brothers said to him, “Shall
you indeed reign over us? Shall you indeed rule over us?” So they hated him
even more for his dreams and for his words. 
Gen
37:9  And he dreamed still another dream
and related it to his brothers, and said, “See, I have dreamed another dream,
and see, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars bowed down to me.” 
Gen
37:10  And he related it to his father
and his brothers. And his father rebuked him and said to him, “What is this
dream that you have dreamed? Shall we, your mother and I and your brothers,
indeed come to bow down to the earth before you?” 
Gen
37:11  And his brothers envied him, but
his father guarded the word. 
Gen
37:12  And his brothers went to feed
their father’s flock in Sheḵem. 
Gen
37:13  And Yisra’ĕl said to Yosĕph,
“Are not your brothers feeding the flock
in Sheḵem? Come, I send you to them.” So he said to him, “Here I am.” 
Gen
37:14  And he said to him, “Please go and
see if it is well with your brothers and well with the sheep, and bring back
word to me.” So he sent him out of the Valley of Ḥeḇron, and he
went to Sheḵem. 
Gen
37:15  And a certain man found him, and
see, he was wandering in the field. And the man asked him, saying, “What do you
seek?” 
Gen
37:16  And he said, “I am seeking my
brothers. Please inform me where they are feeding their sheep.” 
Gen
37:17  And the man said, “They have left
here, for I heard them say, ‘Let us go towards Dothan.’ ” So Yosĕph went
after his brothers and found them in Dothan. 
Gen
37:18  And they saw him from a distance,
and before he came near them, they plotted against him, to kill him. 
Gen
37:19  And they said to each other, “See,
this master of dreams is coming! 
Gen
37:20  “Now, then, come and let us now
kill him and throw him into some pit, and shall say, ‘Some wild beast has
devoured him.’ Let us then see what comes of his dreams!” 
Gen
37:21  But Re’uḇĕn heard and
rescued him from their hands, and said, “Let us not take his life.” 
Gen
37:22  And Re’uḇĕn said to
them, “Shed no blood. Throw him into this pit which is in the wilderness, and
do not lay a hand on him” – in order to rescue him out of their hands, and
bring him back to his father. 
Gen
37:23  So it came to be, when Yosĕph
had come to his brothers, that they stripped Yosĕph of his robe, the long
robe which was on him. 
Gen
37:24  And they took him and threw him
into a pit. And the pit was empty, there was no water in it. 
Gen
37:25  And they sat down to eat a meal.
And they lifted their eyes and looked and saw a company of Yishma‛ĕlites,
coming from Gil‛aḏ with their camels, bearing spices, and balm, and
myrrh, going to take them down to Mitsrayim. 
Gen
37:26  And Yehuḏah said to his
brothers, “What would we gain if we kill our brother and conceal his blood? 
Gen
37:27  “Come and let us sell him to the
Yishma‛ĕlites, and let not our hand be upon him, for he is our
brother, our flesh.” And his brothers listened. 
Gen
37:28  And men, Miḏyanite traders
passed by, so they pulled Yosĕph up and lifted him out of the pit, and
sold him to the Yishma‛ĕlites for twenty pieces of silver. And they
took Yosĕph to Mitsrayim. 
Gen
37:29  And Re’uḇĕn returned to
the pit, and see, Yosĕph was not in the pit. And he tore his garments. 
Gen
37:30  And he returned to his brothers
and said, “The boy is gone! And I, where am I to go?” 
Gen
37:31  So they took Yosĕph’s robe,
killed a male goat, and dipped the robe in the blood, 
Gen
37:32  and sent the long robe and brought
it to their father and said, “We have found this. Please look, is it the robe
of your son or not?” 
Gen
37:33  And he recognised it and said, “It
is my son’s robe. An evil beast has devoured him. Yosĕph is torn, torn to
pieces.” 
Gen
37:34  And Ya‛aqoḇ tore his
garments, and put sackcloth on his waist, and mourned for his son many days. 
Gen
37:35  And all his sons and all his
daughters arose to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted, and he said, “Now
let me go down into the grave to my son in mourning.” So his father wept for
him. 
Gen
37:36  And the Miḏanites had sold
him in Mitsrayim to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh and captain of the guard. 
Gen
38:1  And at that time it came to be that
Yehuḏah left his brothers, and turned aside to a man, an Aḏullamite
whose name was Ḥirah. 
Gen
38:2  And Yehuḏah saw there a
daughter of a certain Kena‛anite whose name was Shuwa. And he took her
and went in to her. 
Gen
38:3  So she conceived and bore a son,
and he called his name Ĕr. 
Gen
38:4  And she conceived again and bore a
son, and she called his name Onan. 
Gen
38:5  And she conceived yet again and
bore a son, and called his name Shĕlah. And he was at Keziḇ when she
bore him. 
Gen
38:6  And Yehuḏah took a wife for Ĕr
his first-born, and her name was Tamar. 
Gen
38:7  But Ĕr, Yehuḏah’s
first-born, was evil in the eyes of יהוה, and יהוה
took his life. 
Gen
38:8  And Yehuḏah said to Onan, “Go
in to your brother’s wife and marry her, and raise up an heir to your brother.”

Gen
38:9  And Onan knew that the offspring
would not be his. And it came to be, when he went in to his brother’s wife,
that he spilled on the ground, lest he should give an offspring to his brother.

Gen
38:10  But what he did displeased יהוה,
so He took his life too. 
Gen
38:11  Then Yehuḏah said to Tamar
his daughter-in-law, “Remain a widow in your father’s house until my son Shĕlah
is grown.” For he said, “Lest he also die as his brothers did.” And Tamar went
and dwelt in her father’s house. 
Gen
38:12  And after a long time the daughter
of Shuwa, Yehuḏah’s wife, died. And Yehuḏah was comforted, and went
up to his sheep-shearers at Timnah, he and his friend Ḥirah the Aḏullamite.

Gen
38:13  And it was reported to Tamar,
saying, “See, your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep.” 
Gen
38:14  And she took off her widow’s
garments, and covered herself with a veil and wrapped herself, and sat at the
entrance to Ĕnayim which was on the way to Timnah. For she saw that Shĕlah
was grown, and she was not given to him as a wife. 
Gen
38:15  And Yehuḏah saw her, and
reckoned her for a whore, for she had covered her face. 
Gen
38:16  And he turned aside to her by the
way, and said, “Please let me come in to you,” for he did not know that she was
his daughter-in-law. And she said, “What do you give me to come in to me?” 
Gen
38:17  And he said, “Let me send you a
young goat from the flock.” And she said, “Do you give me a pledge until you
send it?” 
Gen
38:18  So he said, “What pledge should I
give you?” And she said, “Your seal and your cord and your staff that is in
your hand.” And he gave them to her, and went in to her, and she conceived by
him. 
Gen
38:19  And she arose and went away, and
removed her veil and put on the garments of her widowhood. 
Gen
38:20  And Yehuḏah sent the young
goat by the hand of his friend the Aḏullamite, to receive his pledge from
the woman’s hand, but he did not find her. 
Gen
38:21  And he asked the men of that
place, saying, “Where is the cult prostitute who was beside the way to Ĕnayim?”
And they said, “There was no cult prostitute in this place.” 
Gen
38:22  And he returned to Yehuḏah
and said, “I have not found her. And the men of the place also said there was
no cult prostitute in this place.” 
Gen
38:23  And Yehuḏah said, “Let her
take them for herself, lest we become despised, for I sent this young goat and
you have not found her.” 
Gen
38:24  And it came to be, about three
months after, that Yehuḏah was informed, saying, “Tamar your
daughter-in-law has whored, and see, she has conceived by whoring.” And Yehuḏah
said, “Bring her out and let her be burned!” 
Gen
38:25  When she was brought out, she sent
to her father-in-law, saying, “By the man to whom these belong, I am pregnant.”
And she said, “Please examine whose these are: the seal and the cord and the
staff.” 
Gen
38:26  And Yehuḏah examined and
said, “She has been more righteous than I, because I did not give her to Shĕlah
my son.” And he never knew her again. 
Gen
38:27  And it came to be, at the time for
giving birth, that see, twins were in her womb. 
Gen
38:28  And it came to be, when she was
giving birth, that the one put out his hand. And the midwife took a scarlet
thread and bound it on his hand, saying, “This one came out first.” 
Gen
38:29  And it came to be, as he drew back
his hand, that see, his brother came out! And she said, “How did you break
through? This breach be upon you!” So his name was called Perets. 
Gen
38:30  And afterward his brother came out
who had the scarlet thread on his hand. So his name was called Zeraḥ. 
Gen
39:1  And Yosĕph had been taken down
to Mitsrayim. And Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, a
Mitsrite, bought him from the Yishma‛ĕlites who had taken him down
there. 
Gen
39:2  And it came to be that יהוה
was with Yosĕph, and he became a prosperous man, and was in the house of
his master the Mitsrite. 
Gen
39:3  And his master saw that יהוה
was with him and that יהוה made all he did to prosper
in his hand. 
Gen
39:4  So Yosĕph found favour in his
eyes, and served him, and he appointed him over his house, and gave into his
hand all that he had. 
Gen
39:5  And it came to be, from the time
that he appointed him over his house and all that he had, that יהוה
blessed the Mitsrite’s house for Yosĕph’s sake. And the blessing of יהוה
was on all that he had in the house and in the field. 
Gen
39:6  And he left in Yosĕph’s hand
all that he had, and he did not know what he had except for the bread which he
ate. And Yosĕph was handsome in form and appearance. 
Gen
39:7  And after these events it came to
be that his master’s wife lifted up her eyes to Yosĕph and said, “Lie with
me.” 
Gen
39:8  But he refused and said to his
master’s wife, “Look, my master does not know what is with me in the house, and
he has given into my hand all that he has. 
Gen
39:9  “No one is greater in this house
than I, and he has not withheld whatever from me but you, because you are his
wife. And how shall I do this great evil and sin against Elohim?” 
Gen
39:10  And it came to be, as she spoke to
Yosĕph day by day, that he did not listen to her, to lie with her, to be
with her. 
Gen
39:11  And it came to be on a certain
day, when Yosĕph went into the house to do his work, and none of the men
of the house was inside, 
Gen
39:12  that she caught him by his
garment, saying, “Lie with me.” But he left his garment in her hand, and fled
and ran outside. 
Gen
39:13  And it came to be, when she saw
that he had left his garment in her hand and fled outside, 
Gen
39:14  that she called to the men of her
house and spoke to them, saying, “See, he has brought in to us a Heḇrew
to mock us. He came in to me to lie with me, and I cried out with a loud voice.

Gen
39:15  “And it came to be, when he heard
that I lifted my voice and cried out, that he left his garment with me, and
fled and went outside.” 
Gen
39:16  And she kept his garment with her
until his master came home. 
Gen
39:17  And she spoke to him these same
words, saying, “The Heḇrew servant whom you brought to us came in to me,
to mock me, 
Gen
39:18  so it came to be, as I lifted my
voice and cried out, that he left his garment with me and fled outside.” 
Gen
39:19  And it came to be, when his master
heard the words which his wife spoke to him, saying, “Your servant did to me
according to these words,” that his displeasure burned. 
Gen
39:20  Then Yosĕph’s master took him
and put him into the prison, a place where the sovereign’s prisoners were confined.
And he was there in the prison. 
Gen
39:21  But יהוה
was with Yosĕph and extended kindness to him, and He gave him favour in
the eyes of the prison warden. 
Gen
39:22  And the prison warden gave into
the hand of Yosĕph all the prisoners who were in the prison, and whatever
was done there was his doing. 
Gen
39:23  The prison warden did not look
into any point that was under Yosĕph’s hand, because יהוה
was with him. And whatever he did, יהוה made it
prosper. 
Gen
40:1  And after these events it came to
be that the cupbearer and the baker of the sovereign of Mitsrayim sinned
against their master, the sovereign of Mitsrayim. 
Gen
40:2  And Pharaoh was wroth with his two
officers, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker. 
Gen
40:3  So he put them in confinement in
the house of the captain of the guard, in the prison, the place where Yosĕph
was a prisoner. 
Gen
40:4  And the captain of the guard put
Yosĕph in charge of them, and he served them. So they were in confinement
for some time. 
Gen
40:5  Then the cupbearer and the baker of
the sovereign of Mitsrayim, who were confined in the prison, dreamed a dream,
both of them, each man’s dream in one night and each man’s dream with its own
interpretation. 
Gen
40:6  And Yosĕph came in to them in
the morning and looked at them and saw that they were sad. 
Gen
40:7  And he asked Pharaoh’s officers who
were with him in confinement of his master’s house, saying, “Why do you look so
sad today?” 
Gen
40:8  And they said to him, “We each have
dreamed a dream, and there is no one to interpret it.” And Yosĕph said to
them, “Do not interpretations belong to Elohim? Relate them to me, please.” 
Gen
40:9  So the chief cupbearer related his
dream to Yosĕph, and said to him, “See, in my dream a vine was before me, 
Gen
40:10  and in the vine were three
branches, and it was as though it budded – its blossoms shot forth, and its
clusters brought forth ripe grapes. 
Gen
40:11  “And Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand.
So I took the grapes and pressed them into Pharaoh’s cup, and placed the cup in
Pharaoh’s hand.” 
Gen
40:12  And Yosĕph said to him, “This
is the interpretation of it: The three branches are three days. 
Gen
40:13  “Yet, within three days Pharaoh is
going to lift up your head and restore you to your place, and you shall put
Pharaoh’s cup in his hand according to the former ruling, when you were his
cupbearer. 
Gen
40:14  “But remember me when it is well
with you, and please show kindness to me. And mention me to Pharaoh, and get me
out of this house. 
Gen
40:15  “For truly I was stolen away from
the land of the Heḇrews. And also I have done naught that they should put
me into the dungeon.” 
Gen
40:16  And the chief baker saw that the
interpretation was good, and he said to Yosĕph, “I also was in my dream
and saw three white baskets were on my head, 
Gen
40:17  and in the uppermost basket all
kinds of baked goods for Pharaoh, and the birds ate them out of the basket on
my head.” 
Gen
40:18  And Yosĕph answered and said,
“This is the interpretation of it: The three baskets are three days. 
Gen
40:19  “Yet, within three days Pharaoh is
going to lift off your head from you and hang you on a tree. And the birds
shall eat your flesh from you.” 
Gen
40:20  And on the third day, Pharaoh’s
birthday, it came to be that he made a feast for all his servants. And he
lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and of the chief baker among his
servants, 
Gen
40:21  and he restored the chief
cupbearer to his post of cupbearer again, and he placed the cup in Pharaoh’s
hand, 
Gen
40:22  but he hanged the chief baker, as
Yosĕph had interpreted to them. 
Gen
40:23  And the chief cupbearer did not
remember Yosĕph, but forgot him. 
Gen
41:1  And it came to be, at the end of
two years’ time, that Pharaoh had a dream, and saw him standing by the river, 
Gen
41:2  and saw seven cows coming up out of
the river, fine looking and fat, and they fed amongst the reeds, 
Gen
41:3  then saw seven other cows coming up
after them out of the river, ugly and lean of flesh, and stood by the other
cows on the bank of the river. 
Gen
41:4  And the ugly and lean of flesh cows
ate up the seven fine looking and fat cows. Then Pharaoh awoke. 
Gen
41:5  And he slept and dreamed a second
time and saw seven heads of grain coming up on one stalk, plump and good, 
Gen
41:6  and saw seven lean heads, scorched
by the east wind, coming up after them. 
Gen
41:7  And the seven lean heads swallowed
the seven plump and complete heads. Then Pharaoh awoke and saw it was a dream. 
Gen
41:8  And it came to be in the morning
that his spirit was moved, and he sent and called for all the magicians of
Mitsrayim and all its wise men. And Pharaoh related to them his dreams, but
there was no one who could interpret them for Pharaoh. 
Gen
41:9  Then the chief cupbearer spoke to
Pharaoh, saying, “I remember my crimes this day. 
Gen
41:10  “When Pharaoh was wroth with his
servants, and put me in confinement in the house of the captain of the guard,
both me and the chief baker, 
Gen
41:11  each one of us dreamed a dream in
one night, he and I. Each of us dreamed according to the interpretation of his
own dream. 
Gen
41:12  “And there was with us a Heḇrew
youth, a servant of the captain of the guard. And we related to him, and he
interpreted our dreams for us. To each man he interpreted according to his own
dream. 
Gen
41:13  “And it came to be, as he
interpreted for us, so it came to be. He restored me to my office, and he
hanged him.” 
Gen
41:14  Then Pharaoh sent and called Yosĕph,
and they hurriedly brought him out of the dungeon. And he shaved and changed
his garments, and came to Pharaoh. 
Gen
41:15  And Pharaoh said to Yosĕph, “I
have dreamed a dream, and there is no one to interpret it. Now I myself have
heard it said of you that you understand a dream, to interpret it.” 
Gen
41:16  And Yosĕph answered Pharaoh,
saying, “It is not in me, let Elohim answer Pharaoh with peace.” 
Gen
41:17  And Pharaoh said to Yosĕph, “See,
in my dream I stood on the bank of the river 
Gen
41:18  and saw seven cows coming up out
of the river, fine looking and fat, and they fed amongst the reeds, 
Gen
41:19  then saw seven other cows coming
up after them, poor and very ugly and lean of flesh, such ugliness as I have
never seen in all the land of Mitsrayim. 
Gen
41:20  “And the lean of flesh and ugly
cows ate up the first seven, the fat cows. 
Gen
41:21  “Yet when they had eaten them up,
no one would have known that they had eaten them, for they were as ugly as at
the beginning. Then I awoke. 
Gen
41:22  “Also, I looked in my dream and
saw seven heads coming up on one stalk, complete and good, 
Gen
41:23  then saw seven heads, withered,
lean, scorched by the east wind, coming up after them. 
Gen
41:24  “And the lean heads swallowed the
seven good heads. And I spoke to the magicians, but there was no one who could
explain it to me.” 
Gen
41:25  And Yosĕph said to Pharaoh, “The
dream of Pharaoh is one. Elohim has shown Pharaoh what He is about to do: 
Gen
41:26  “The seven good cows are seven
years, and the seven good heads are seven years – it is one dream. 
Gen
41:27  “And the seven lean and ugly cows
which came up after them are seven years, and the seven empty heads scorched by
the east wind are seven years of scarcity of food. 
Gen
41:28  “This is the word which I spoke to
Pharaoh: Elohim has shown Pharaoh what He is about to do. 
Gen
41:29  “See, seven years of great plenty
are coming in all the land of Mitsrayim, 
Gen
41:30  but after them seven years of
scarcity of food shall arise and all the plenty be forgotten in the land of Mitsrayim.
And the scarcity of food shall destroy the land, 
Gen
41:31  and the plenty shall not be
remembered in the land, because of the scarcity of food following, for it is
very severe. 
Gen
41:32  “And the dream was repeated to
Pharaoh twice because the word is established by Elohim, and Elohim is
hastening to do it. 
Gen
41:33  “And now, let Pharaoh look for a
discerning and wise man, and set him over the land of Mitsrayim. 
Gen
41:34  “Let Pharaoh do this, and let him
appoint overseers over the land, to take up one-fifth of the land of Mitsrayim
in the seven years of plenty. 
Gen
41:35  “And let them gather all the food
of those good years that are coming, and store up grain under the hand of
Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities. 
Gen
41:36  “And the food shall be for a store
for the land for the seven years of scarcity of food which shall be in the land
of Mitsrayim, and do not let the land be cut off by the scarcity of food.” 
Gen
41:37  And the word was good in the eyes
of Pharaoh and in the eyes of all his servants. 
Gen
41:38  And Pharaoh said to his servants, “Could
we find another like him, a man in whom is the Spirit of Elohim?” 
Gen
41:39  Then Pharaoh said to Yosĕph, “Since
Elohim has shown you all this, there is no one as discerning and wise as you. 
Gen
41:40  “Be over my house, you yourself,
and at your mouth all my people shall kiss – only in the throne I am greater
than you.” 
Gen
41:41  And Pharaoh said to Yosĕph, “See,
I have set you over all the land of Mitsrayim.” 
Gen
41:42  And Pharaoh took his seal-ring off
his hand and put it on Yosĕph’s hand. And he dressed him in garments of
fine linen and put a gold chain around his neck. 
Gen
41:43  And he had him ride in the second
chariot which he had. And they cried out before him, “Bow the knee!” And he set
him over all the land of Mitsrayim. 
Gen
41:44  And Pharaoh said to Yosĕph, “I
am Pharaoh, and without a word from
you let no man lift his hand or foot in all the land of Mitsrayim.” 
Gen
41:45  And Pharaoh called Yosĕph’s
name Zaphnath-Pa‛nĕaḥ. And he gave him as a wife Asenath, the
daughter of Poti-Pherah priest of On. And Yosĕph went out over all the
land of Mitsrayim. 
Gen
41:46  Now Yosĕph was thirty years
old when he stood before Pharaoh sovereign of Mitsrayim. And Yosĕph went
out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of
Mitsrayim. 
Gen
41:47  And in the seven years of plenty
the ground brought forth generously. 
Gen
41:48  And he gathered all the food of
the seven years which were in the land of Mitsrayim, and laid up the food in
the cities. He laid up in every city the food of the fields which surrounded
them. 
Gen
41:49  Thus Yosĕph gathered very
much grain, as the sand of the sea, until he ceased counting, for it was
without number. 
Gen
41:50  And to Yosĕph were born two
sons before the years of scarcity of food came, whom Asenath, the daughter of
Poti-Pherah priest of On, bore to him. 
Gen
41:51  And Yosĕph called the name of
the first-born Menashsheh, “For Elohim has made me forget all my toil and all
my father’s house.” 
Gen
41:52  And the name of the second he
called Ephrayim, “For Elohim has caused me to bear fruit in the land of my
affliction.” 
Gen
41:53  And the seven years of plenty
which were in the land of Mitsrayim came to an end, 
Gen
41:54  and the seven years of scarcity of
food began to come, as Yosĕph had said. And the scarcity of food was in
all lands, but in all the land of Mitsrayim there was bread. 
Gen
41:55  But when all the land of Mitsrayim
hungered, and the people cried to Pharaoh for bread, Pharaoh said to all the
Mitsrites, “Go to Yosĕph, do whatever he says to you.” 
Gen
41:56  And the scarcity of food was over
all the face of the earth, and Yosĕph opened all the storehouses and sold
to the Mitsrites. And the scarcity of food was severe in the land of Mitsrayim.

Gen
41:57  And all the earth came to Yosĕph
in Mitsrayim to buy grain, because the scarcity of food was severe in all the
earth. 
Gen
42:1  And when Ya‛aqoḇ saw that
there was grain in Mitsrayim, Ya‛aqoḇ said to his sons, “Why do you
look at each other?” 
Gen
42:2  And he said, “See, I have heard
that there is grain in Mitsrayim. Go down to that place and buy for us there,
and let us live and not die.” 
Gen
42:3  And Yosĕph’s ten brothers went
down to buy grain in Mitsrayim. 
Gen
42:4  But Ya‛aqoḇ did not
send Yosĕph’s brother Binyamin with his brothers, for he said, “Lest some
harm come to him.” 
Gen
42:5  And the sons of Yisra’ĕl went
to buy grain among those who journeyed, for the scarcity of food was in the
land of Kena‛an. 
Gen
42:6  And Yosĕph was the governor
over the land, he was the one who sold to all the people of the land. And Yosĕph’s
brothers came and bowed down before him with their faces to the earth. 
Gen
42:7  And Yosĕph saw his brothers
and recognised them, but he acted as a stranger to them and spoke to them
harshly, and said to them, “Where do you come from?” And they said, “From the
land of Kena‛an to buy food.” 
Gen
42:8  So Yosĕph recognised his
brothers, but they did not recognise him. 
Gen
42:9  And Yosĕph remembered the
dreams which he had dreamed about them, and said to them, “You are spies! You
have come to see the nakedness of the land!” 
Gen
42:10  And they said to him, “No, my
master, but your servants have come to buy food. 
Gen
42:11  “We are all one man’s sons, we are
trustworthy, your servants are not spies.” 
Gen
42:12  But he said to them, “No, but you
have come to see the nakedness of the land.” 
Gen
42:13  And they said, “Your servants are
twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Kena‛an. And see, the
youngest is with our father today, and one is no more.” 
Gen
42:14  And Yosĕph said to them, “It
is as I spoke to you, saying, ‘You are spies!’ 
Gen
42:15  “By this you shall be proven: By
the life of Pharaoh, you do not leave this place unless your youngest brother
comes here. 
Gen
42:16  “Send one of you, and let him
bring your brother, while you are kept in prison. So let your words be proven
to see whether there is any truth in you, or else, by the life of Pharaoh, you
are spies!” 
Gen
42:17  And he put them all together in
prison for three days. 
Gen
42:18  Now Yosĕph said to them the
third day, “Do this and live, for I fear Elohim: 
Gen
42:19  “If you are trustworthy, let one
of your brothers be confined to your prison house, and you, go, bring grain for
the scarcity of food of your houses. 
Gen
42:20  “And bring your youngest brother
to me, and let your words be confirmed, and you do not die.” And so they did. 
Gen
42:21  And they said to each other, “Truly,
we are guilty concerning our brother, for we saw the distress of his life when
he pleaded with us, yet we did not listen, that is why this distress has come
upon us.” 
Gen
42:22  And Re’uḇĕn answered
them, saying, “Did I not speak to you, saying, ‘Do not sin against the boy,’
and you would not listen? And see, his blood is now required of us.” 
Gen
42:23  And they did not know that Yosĕph
understood them, for he spoke to them through an interpreter. 
Gen
42:24  And he turned himself away from
them and wept, but came back to them and spoke to them. And he took Shim‛on
from them and bound him before their eyes. 
Gen
42:25  And Yosĕph commanded and they
filled their sacks with grain, also to put back every man’s silver to his sack,
and to give them food for the journey. And thus it was done for them. 
Gen
42:26  So they loaded their donkeys with
the grain and went from there. 
Gen
42:27  And as one of them opened his sack
to give his donkey fodder at the lodging place, he saw his silver, for there it
was in the mouth of his sack! 
Gen
42:28  And he said to his brothers, “My
silver has been returned, and there it is, in my sack!” And their hearts sank
and they were afraid, saying to each other, “What is this that Elohim has done
to us?” 
Gen
42:29  So they came to Ya‛aqoḇ
their father in the land of Kena‛an and reported to him all that befell
them, saying, 
Gen
42:30  “The man, the master of the land,
spoke to us harshly, and took us for spies of the land. 
Gen
42:31  “But we said to him, ‘We are
trustworthy, we are not spies. 
Gen
42:32  ‘We are twelve brothers, sons of
our father. One is no more, and the youngest is today with our father in the
land of Kena‛an.’ 
Gen
42:33  “And the man, the master of the
land, said to us, ‘By this I know that you are trustworthy: Leave one of your
brothers here with me, and take food for the scarcity of food of your
households, and go. 
Gen
42:34  ‘And bring your youngest brother
to me, then I know that you are not spies, but that you are trustworthy – I
give your brother to you, and you move about in the land.’ ” 
Gen
42:35  And it came to be as they emptied
their sacks, that look, the bundle of each man’s silver was in his sack! And
when they and their father saw the bundles of silver, they were afraid. 
Gen
42:36  And Ya‛aqoḇ their
father said to them, “You have bereaved me – Yosĕph is no more, and Shim‛on
is no more, and you would take Binyamin! All this is against me.” 
Gen
42:37  So Re’uḇĕn spoke to his
father, saying, “Take the lives of my two sons if I do not bring him back to
you. Put him in my hands, and I myself bring him back to you.” 
Gen
42:38  But he said, “My son is not going
down with you, for his brother is dead, and he is left alone. If any harm
should come to him along the way in which you go, then you would bring down my
grey hair with sorrow to the grave.” 
Gen
43:1  But the scarcity of food was severe
in the land. 
Gen
43:2  And it came to be, when they had
eaten up the grain which they had brought from Mitsrayim, that their father
said to them, “Go back, buy us a little food.” 
Gen
43:3  But Yehuḏah spoke to him,
saying, “The man vehemently warned us, saying, ‘You do not see my face unless
your brother is with you.’ ” 
Gen
43:4  “If you let our brother go with us,
we go down and buy you food. 
Gen
43:5  “But if you do not let him go, we
do not go down, because the man said to us, ‘You do not see my face unless your
brother is with you.’ ” 
Gen
43:6  And Yisra’ĕl said, “Why did
you do evil to me to inform the man that you still had another brother?” 
Gen
43:7  And they said, “The man kept asking
about us and our relatives, saying, ‘Is your father still alive? Have you another brother?’ And we informed him
according to these words. How could we know that he would say, ‘Bring your
brother down’?” 
Gen
43:8  And Yehuḏah said to Yisra’ĕl
his father, “Send the boy with me, and let us arise and go, and live and not
die, both we and you and also our little ones. 
Gen
43:9  “I myself shall stand guaranty for
him – from my hand you are to require him. If I do not bring him back to you
and set him before you, then let me bear the blame forever. 
Gen
43:10  “For if we had not delayed, truly
by now we could have returned this second time.” 
Gen
43:11  And their father Yisra’ĕl
said to them, “If so, then do this: Take some of the best fruit of the land in
your vessels and bring a present down for the man, a little balm and a little
honey, spices and myrrh, nuts and almonds. 
Gen
43:12  “And take double silver in your
hand, and take back in your hand the silver that was returned in the mouth of
your sacks. It could have been a mistake. 
Gen
43:13  “And take your brother, and arise,
go back to the man. 
Gen
43:14  “And Ĕl Shaddai give to you
compassion before the man, so that he shall release your other brother and
Binyamin. And I, if I am bereaved, I am bereaved!” 
Gen
43:15  And the men took that present and
Binyamin, and they took double the amount of silver in their hand, and arose
and went down to Mitsrayim, and stood before Yosĕph. 
Gen
43:16  And Yosĕph saw Binyamin with
them, and said to the one over his house, “Bring the men home, and make a great
slaughter, and prepare, for these men are to eat with me at noon.” 
Gen
43:17  And the man did as Yosĕph
said, and the man brought the men into Yosĕph’s house. 
Gen
43:18  And the men were afraid because
they were brought into Yosĕph’s house. And they said, “It is because of
the silver, which was put back into our sacks the first time, that we are
brought in, to throw himself upon us and fall upon us, to take us as slaves,
our donkeys too.” 
Gen
43:19  So they came near to the man over
the house of Yosĕph, and spoke to him at the door of the house, 
Gen
43:20  and said, “O my master, we indeed
came down the first time to buy food, 
Gen
43:21  but it came to be, when we came to
the lodging place, that we opened our sacks and saw each man’s silver in the
mouth of his sack, our silver in its weight. And we have brought it back in our
hand. 
Gen
43:22  “And we have brought down other
silver in our hands to buy food. We do not know who put our silver in our
sacks.” 
Gen
43:23  But he said, “Peace be with you,
do not be afraid. Your Elohim and the Elohim of your father has given you
treasure in your sacks – your silver had come to me!” And he brought Shim‛on
out to them. 
Gen
43:24  And the man brought the men into
Yosĕph’s house and gave them water, and they washed their feet. And he
gave their donkeys fodder. 
Gen
43:25  And they made the present ready
for Yosĕph’s coming at noon, for they heard that they were to eat there. 
Gen
43:26  And when Yosĕph came home,
they brought him the present which was in their hand, into the house, and bowed
down before him to the earth. 
Gen
43:27  And he asked them about their
welfare, and said, “Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he
still alive?” 
Gen
43:28  And they said, “Your servant our
father is in good health, he is still alive.” And they bowed their heads down
and did obeisance. 
Gen
43:29  And he lifted his eyes and saw his
brother Binyamin, his mother’s son, and said, “Is this your younger brother of
whom you spoke to me?” And he said, “Elohim show favour to you, my son.” 
Gen
43:30  And Yosĕph hurried, for his
emotions were deeply moved towards his brother, and he looked for a place to weep, and went into his room
and wept there. 
Gen
43:31  Then he washed his face and came
out, and controlled himself, and said, “Serve the food.” 
Gen
43:32  And they set him a place by
himself, and them by themselves, and the Mitsrites who ate with him by
themselves, for the Mitsrites could not eat food with the Heḇrews, for
that is an abomination to the Mitsrites. 
Gen
43:33  And they sat before him, the
first-born according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth,
and the men looked at each other in astonishment. 
Gen
43:34  And he took portions to them from
before him, but Binyamin’s portion was five times as much as any of theirs. And
they feasted and they drank with him. 
Gen
44:1  And he commanded the one over his
house, saying, “Fill the men’s sacks with food, as they are able to bear, and
put each man’s silver in the mouth of his sack. 
Gen
44:2  “And put my cup, the silver cup, in
the mouth of the sack of the youngest, and the silver for his grain.” And he
did according to the word of Yosĕph which he spoke. 
Gen
44:3  As soon as the morning was light,
the men were sent away, they and their donkeys. 
Gen
44:4  And when they had gone out of the city,
not having gone far, Yosĕph said to the one over his house, “Rise up,
follow the men, and when you overtake them, say to them, ‘Why have you repaid
evil for good? 
Gen
44:5  ‘Is this not the one from which my
master drinks, and with which he indeed divines? You have done evil in what you
have done.’ ” 
Gen
44:6  So he overtook them and spoke these
words to them. 
Gen
44:7  And they said to him, “Why does my
master say these words? Far be it from us that your servants should do
according to this word. 
Gen
44:8  “See, we brought back to you from
the land of Kena‛an the silver which we found in the mouth of our sacks.
How then should we steal silver or gold from your master’s house? 
Gen
44:9  “With whomever of your servants it
is found – he shall die and we shall become my master’s slaves as well.” 
Gen
44:10  And he said, “Now also let it be
according to your words: he with whom it is found becomes my slave, and you are
innocent.” 
Gen
44:11  And they hurried, each man let
down his sack to the ground, and each opened his sack. 
Gen
44:12  And he searched, with the oldest
first and with the youngest last, and the cup was found in Binyamin’s sack. 
Gen
44:13  And they tore their garments, and
each man loaded his donkey and went back to the city. 
Gen
44:14  And Yehuḏah and his brothers
came to Yosĕph’s house, and he was still there. And they fell before him
on the ground. 
Gen
44:15  And Yosĕph said to them, “What
deed is this you have done? Did you not know that a man like me indeed divines?”

Gen
44:16  And Yehuḏah said, “What do
we say to my master? What do we speak? Or how do we clear ourselves? Elohim has
found out the crookedness of your servants. See, we are my master’s slaves,
both we and he also with whom the cup was found.” 
Gen
44:17  But he said, “Far be it from me to
do this. The man in whose hand the cup was found, he becomes my slave. And you,
go up in peace to your father.” 
Gen
44:18  And Yehuḏah came near to him
and said, “O my master, please let your servant speak a word in my master’s
hearing, and do not let your displeasure burn against your servant, for you are
like Pharaoh. 
Gen
44:19  “My master asked his servants,
saying, ‘Have you a father or a brother?’ 
Gen
44:20  “And we said to my master, ‘We
have a father, an old man, and a young child of his old age, and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his
mother’s children, and his father loves him.’ 
Gen
44:21  “And you said to your servants, ‘Bring
him down to me, and let me set my eyes on him.’ 
Gen
44:22  “And we said to my master, ‘The
boy is not able to leave his father, for if he leaves his father, his father
shall die.’ 
Gen
44:23  “But you said to your servants, ‘Unless
your youngest brother comes down with you, you do not see my face again.’ 
Gen
44:24  “And it came to be, when we went
up to your servant my father, that we told him the words of my master. 
Gen
44:25  “And our father said, ‘Go back and
buy us a little food.’ 
Gen
44:26  “But we said, ‘We are not able to
go down. If our youngest brother is with us, then we shall go down, for we are
not able to see the man’s face unless our youngest brother is with us.’ 
Gen
44:27  “Then your servant my father said
to us, ‘You know that my wife bore me two sons, 
Gen
44:28  and the one went out from me, and
I said, “Truly, he is torn, torn to pieces!” And I have not seen him since. 
Gen
44:29  ‘And if you take this one from me
too, and harm comes to him, you shall bring down my grey hair with evil to the
grave.’ 
Gen
44:30  “And now, if I come to your servant
my father and the boy is not with us – since his own life is bound up in his
life – 
Gen
44:31  then it shall be, when he sees
that the boy is not with us, that he shall die. So your servants shall bring
down the grey hair of your servant our father with evil to the grave. 
Gen
44:32  “For your servant went guaranty
for the boy to my father, saying, ‘If I do not bring him back to you, then I
shall be a sinner before my father forever.’ 
Gen
44:33  “And now, please let your servant
remain instead of the boy as a slave to my master, and let the boy go up with
his brothers. 
Gen
44:34  “For how do I go up to my father
if the boy is not with me, lest I see the evil that would come upon my father?”

Gen
45:1  And Yosĕph was unable to
restrain himself before all those who stood by him, and he called out, “Have
everyone go out from me!” So no one stood with him while Yosĕph made
himself known to his brothers. 
Gen
45:2  And he wept aloud, and the
Mitsrites and the house of Pharaoh heard it. 
Gen
45:3  And Yosĕph said to his
brothers, “I am Yosĕph, is my father still alive?” But his brothers were
unable to answer him, for they trembled before him. 
Gen
45:4  Then Yosĕph said to his
brothers, “Please come near to me.” And when they came near, he said, “I am Yosĕph
your brother, whom you sold into Mitsrayim. 
Gen
45:5  “And now, do not be grieved nor
displeased with yourselves because you sold me here, for Elohim sent me before
you to preserve life. 
Gen
45:6  “For two years now the scarcity of
food has been in the land, and there are still five years in which there is
neither ploughing nor harvesting. 
Gen
45:7  “And Elohim sent me before you to
preserve for you a remnant in the earth, and to give life to you by a great
escape. 
Gen
45:8  “So then, you did not send me here,
but Elohim. And He has set me for a father to Pharaoh, and master of all his
house, and a ruler throughout all the land of Mitsrayim. 
Gen
45:9  “Hurry and go up to my father, and
say to him, ‘Thus says your son Yosĕph, “Elohim has made me master of all
Mitsrayim. Come down to me, do not delay. 
Gen
45:10  “And you shall dwell in the land
of Goshen, and be near to me, you and your children, your children’s children,
your flocks and your herds, and all that you have. 
Gen
45:11  “And I shall provide for you
there, lest you and your household, and all that you have, come to poverty,
because five years of scarcity of food are still to come.” ’ 
Gen
45:12  “And look, your eyes and the eyes
of my brother Binyamin see that it is my mouth that speaks to you. 
Gen
45:13  “And you shall inform my father of
all my esteem in Mitsrayim, and of all that you have seen. And you shall hurry
and bring my father down here.” 
Gen
45:14  And he fell on his brother
Binyamin’s neck and wept, and Binyamin wept on his neck. 
Gen
45:15  And he kissed all his brothers and
wept over them, and after that his brothers spoke with him. 
Gen
45:16  And the report of it was heard by
the house of Pharaoh, saying, “The brothers of Yosĕph have come.” And it
was good in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of his servants. 
Gen
45:17  And Pharaoh said to Yosĕph, “Say
to your brothers, ‘Do this: Load your beasts and go, enter the land of Kena‛an,

Gen
45:18  and take your father and your
households and come to me, and I give you the best of the land of Mitsrayim,
and you eat the fat of the land. 
Gen
45:19  ‘And you, you have been commanded,
do this: Take wagons out of the land of Mitsrayim for your little ones and your
wives. And you shall bring your father, and come. 
Gen
45:20  ‘And do not be concerned about
your goods, for the best of all the land of Mitsrayim is yours.’ ” 
Gen
45:21  And the sons of Yisra’ĕl did
so. And Yosĕph gave them wagons, according to the command of Pharaoh, and
he gave them food for the journey. 
Gen
45:22  He gave to all of them, to each
man, changes of garments, but to Binyamin he gave three hundred pieces of
silver and five changes of garments. 
Gen
45:23  And he sent to his father this:
ten donkeys loaded with the best of Mitsrayim, and ten female donkeys loaded with
grain, and bread, and food for his father for the journey. 
Gen
45:24  So he sent his brothers away, and
they left. And he said to them, “Do not quarrel along the way.” 
Gen
45:25  And they went up out of Mitsrayim,
and came to the land of Kena‛an to Ya‛aqoḇ their father. 
Gen
45:26  And they told him, saying, “Yosĕph
is still alive, and he is governor over all the land of Mitsrayim.” And Ya‛aqoḇ’s
heart ceased, for he did not believe them. 
Gen
45:27  But when they spoke to him all the
words which Yosĕph had spoken to them, and when he saw the wagons which
Yosĕph had sent to transport him, the spirit of Ya‛aqoḇ their
father revived. 
Gen
45:28  And Yisra’ĕl said, “Enough!
My son Yosĕph is still alive. Let me go and see him before I die.” 
Gen
46:1  And Yisra’ĕl set out with all
that he had, and came to Be’ĕrsheḇa, and brought offerings to the
Elohim of his father Yitsḥaq. 
Gen
46:2  And Elohim spoke to Yisra’ĕl
in the visions of the night, and said, “Ya‛aqoḇ, Ya‛aqoḇ!”
And he said, “Here I am.” 
Gen
46:3  And He said, “I am the Ĕl,
Elohim of your father. Do not be afraid to go down to Mitsrayim, for I shall
make you there into a great nation. 
Gen
46:4  “I Myself am going down with you to
Mitsrayim and I Myself shall certainly bring you up again. And let Yosĕph
put his hand on your eyes.” 
Gen
46:5  And Ya‛aqoḇ rose up
from Be’ĕrsheḇa. And the sons of Yisra’ĕl brought their father
Ya‛aqoḇ, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons
which Pharaoh had sent to transport him. 
Gen
46:6  And they took their livestock and
their property which they had acquired in the land of Kena‛an, and came
into Mitsrayim, Ya‛aqoḇ and all his seed with him. 
Gen
46:7  His sons and his sons’ sons, his
daughters and his sons’ daughters, and all his seed he brought with him to
Mitsrayim. 
Gen
46:8  And these were the names of the
children of Yisra’ĕl, Ya‛aqoḇ and his sons, who came into
Mitsrayim: Re’uḇĕn was Ya‛aqoḇ’s first-born. 
Gen
46:9  And the sons of Re’uḇĕn:
Ḥanoḵ, and Pallu, and Ḥetsron, and Karmi. 
Gen
46:10  And the sons of Shim‛on:
Yemu’ĕl, and Yamin, and Ohaḏ, and Yaḵin, and Tsoḥar, and
Sha’ul, son of a Kena‛anite woman. 
Gen
46:11  And the sons of Lĕwi: Gĕreshon,
Qehath, and Merari. 
Gen
46:12  And the sons of Yehuḏah: Ĕr,
and Onan, and Shĕlah, and Perets, and Zeraḥ – but Ĕr and Onan
died in the land of Kena‛an. And the sons of Perets were Ḥetsron
and Ḥamul. 
Gen
46:13  And the sons of Yissasḵar:
Tola, and Puw‛ah, and Yoḇ, and Shimron. 
Gen
46:14  And the sons of Zeḇulun:
Sereḏ, and Ĕlon, and Yaḥle’ĕl. 
Gen
46:15  These were the sons of Lĕ’ah,
whom she bore to Ya‛aqoḇ in Paddan Aram, with his daughter Dinah.
All the beings, his sons and his daughters, were thirty-three. 
Gen
46:16  And the sons of Gaḏ:
Tsiphyon and Ḥaggi, Shuni and Etsbon, Ĕri and Aroḏi, and Arĕli.

Gen
46:17  And the sons of Ashĕr:
Yimnah, and Yishwah, and Yishwi, and Beri‛ah, and Seraḥ, their
sister. And the sons of Beri‛ah: Ḥeḇer and Malki’ĕl. 
Gen
46:18  These were the sons of Zilpah,
whom Laḇan gave to Lĕ’ah his daughter. And these she bore to Ya‛aqoḇ:
sixteen beings. 
Gen
46:19  The sons of Raḥĕl, Ya‛aqoḇ’s
wife: Yosĕph and Binyamin. 
Gen
46:20  And to Yosĕph in the land of
Mitsrayim were born Menashsheh and Ephrayim, whom Asenath, the daughter of
Poti-Pherah priest of On, bore to him. 
Gen
46:21  And the sons of Binyamin: Belah,
and Beḵer, and Ashbĕl, Gĕra and Na‛aman, Ĕḥi
and Rosh, Muppim and Ḥuppim, and Ard. 
Gen
46:22  These were the sons of Raḥĕl
who were born to Ya‛aqoḇ: fourteen beings in all. 
Gen
46:23  And the son of Dan: Ḥushim. 
Gen
46:24  And the sons of Naphtali:
Yaḥtse’ĕl, and Guni, and Yĕtser, and Shillĕm. 
Gen
46:25  These were the sons of Bilhah,
whom Laḇan gave to Raḥĕl his daughter, and she bore these to
Ya‛aqoḇ: seven beings in all. 
Gen
46:26  All the beings who went with Ya‛aqoḇ
to Mitsrayim, who came from his body, besides Ya‛aqoḇ’s sons’
wives, were sixty-six beings in all. 
Gen
46:27  And the sons of Yosĕph who
were born to him in Mitsrayim were two beings. All the beings of the house of
Ya‛aqoḇ who went to Mitsrayim were seventy. 
Gen
46:28  And he sent Yehuḏah before
him to Yosĕph, to point out before him the way to Goshen. And they came to
the land of Goshen. 
Gen
46:29  And Yosĕph made ready his
chariot and went up to Goshen to meet his father Yisra’ĕl. And he appeared
to him, and fell on his neck and wept on his neck a long time. 
Gen
46:30  And Yisra’ĕl said to Yosĕph,
“Now let me die, since I have seen your face, that you are still alive.” 
Gen
46:31  And Yosĕph said to his
brothers and to his father’s household, “I am going up to inform Pharaoh, and
say to him, ‘My brothers and those of my father’s house, who were in the land
of Kena‛an, have come to me. 
Gen
46:32  ‘And the men are shepherds, that
they have been men of livestock, and they have brought their flocks and their
herds, and all that they have.’ 
Gen
46:33  “And it shall be, when Pharaoh
calls you and says, ‘What is your occupation?’ 
Gen
46:34  that you shall say, ‘Your servants
have been men of livestock from our youth even till now, both we and also our
fathers,’ so that you dwell in the land of Goshen, for every shepherd is an
abomination to the Mitsrites.” 
Gen
47:1  Then Yosĕph went and spoke to
Pharaoh, and said, “My father and my brothers, their flocks and their herds and
all that they possess, have come from the land of Kena‛an. And see, they
are in the land of Goshen.” 
Gen
47:2  And he took five men from among his
brothers and presented them to Pharaoh. 
Gen
47:3  And Pharaoh said to his brothers, “What
is your occupation?” And they said to Pharaoh, “Your servants are shepherds,
both we and also our fathers.” 
Gen
47:4  And they said to Pharaoh, “We have
come to dwell in the land, because there is no pasture for your servant’s
flocks, for the scarcity of food is severe in the land of Kena‛an. And
now, please let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen.” 
Gen
47:5  And Pharaoh spoke to Yosĕph,
saying, “Your father and your brothers have come to you. 
Gen
47:6  “The land of Mitsrayim is before
you. Settle your father and brothers in the best of the land, let them dwell in
the land of Goshen. And if you know of capable men among them, then make them
chief herdsmen over my livestock.” 
Gen
47:7  And Yosĕph brought in his
father Ya‛aqoḇ and set him before Pharaoh. And Ya‛aqoḇ
blessed Pharaoh. 
Gen
47:8  And Pharaoh said to Ya‛aqoḇ,
“How old are you?” 
Gen
47:9  And Ya‛aqoḇ said to
Pharaoh, “The days of the years of my sojournings are one hundred and thirty
years. Few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and they have
not reached the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of
their sojournings.” 
Gen
47:10  And Ya‛aqoḇ blessed
Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh. 
Gen
47:11  So Yosĕph settled his father
and his brothers, and gave them a possession in the land of Mitsrayim, in the
best of the land, in the land of Ra‛meses, as Pharaoh had commanded. 
Gen
47:12  And Yosĕph provided his
father, and his brothers, and all his father’s household with bread for the
mouth of the little ones. 
Gen
47:13  Now there was no bread in all the
land, because the scarcity of food was very severe, and the land of Mitsrayim
and all the land of Kena‛an became exhausted from the scarcity of food. 
Gen
47:14  And Yosĕph gathered up all
the silver that was found in the land of Mitsrayim and in the land of Kena‛an,
for the grain which they bought. And Yosĕph brought the silver into
Pharaoh’s house. 
Gen
47:15  And when the silver was all spent
in the land of Mitsrayim and in the land of Kena‛an, all the Mitsrites
came to Yosĕph and said, “Give us bread, for why should we die in your
presence? For the silver is gone!” 
Gen
47:16  And Yosĕph said, “Give your
livestock, and I give you bread for your livestock, if the silver is gone.” 
Gen
47:17  So they brought their livestock to
Yosĕph, and Yosĕph gave them bread in exchange for the horses, and
for the flocks they owned, and for the herds they owned, and for the donkeys.
Thus he fed them with bread in exchange for all their livestock that year.  
Gen
47:18  And when that year had ended, they
came to him the next year and said to him, “We do not hide from my master that
our silver is all spent, and my master also has the livestock we owned. There
has not any been left before my master but our bodies and our lands. 
Gen
47:19  “Why should we die before your
eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for bread, and let us and our
land be servants of Pharaoh. And give us seed, and let us live and not die, and
let the land not lie waste.” 
Gen
47:20  And Yosĕph bought the entire
land of Mitsrayim for Pharaoh, because every man of the Mitsrites sold his
field, because the scarcity of food was severe upon them. And the land came to
be Pharaoh’s. 
Gen
47:21  And as for the people, he moved
them into the cities, from one end of the borders of Mitsrayim to the other
end. 
Gen
47:22  Only the ground of the priests he
did not buy, for the priests had portions allotted to them by Pharaoh, and they
ate their portions which Pharaoh gave them. Therefore they did not sell their
ground. 
Gen
47:23  And Yosĕph said to the
people, “Look, I have bought you and your land today for Pharaoh. Look, here is
seed for you, and you shall sow the land. 
Gen
47:24  “And it shall be that in the
harvest you shall give one-fifth to Pharaoh. And four-fifths is your own, as
seed for the field and for your food, for those of your households and as food
for your little ones.” 
Gen
47:25  And they said, “You have saved our
lives. Let us find favour in the eyes of my master, and we shall become Pharaoh’s
servants.” 
Gen
47:26  And Yosĕph made it a law over
the land of Mitsrayim to this day, that Pharaoh should have one-fifth, except
for the ground of the priests only, which did not become Pharaoh’s. 
Gen
47:27  And Yisra’ĕl dwelt in the
land of Mitsrayim, in the land of Goshen. And they had possessions there and
bore fruit and increased exceedingly. 
Gen
47:28  And Ya‛aqoḇ lived in
the land of Mitsrayim seventeen years. So the length of Ya‛aqoḇ’s
life was one hundred and forty-seven years. 
Gen
47:29  And the time for Yisra’ĕl to
die drew near, and he called his son Yosĕph and said to him, “Now if I
have found favour in your eyes, please put your hand under my thigh, and show
kindness and truth to me. Please do not bury me in Mitsrayim, 
Gen
47:30  but I shall lie with my fathers,
and you shall take me up out of Mitsrayim and bury me in their burial place.”
And he said, “I do as you have said.” 
Gen
47:31  And he said, “Swear to me.” And he
swore to him, and Yisra’ĕl bowed himself on the head of the bed. 
Gen
48:1  And after these events it came to
be that it was said to Yosĕph, “See, your father is sick.” And he took
with him his two sons, Menashsheh and Ephrayim. 
Gen
48:2  And Ya‛aqoḇ was told, “See,
your son Yosĕph is coming to you.” And Yisra’ĕl strengthened himself
and sat up on the bed. 
Gen
48:3  And Ya‛aqoḇ said to Yosĕph,
“Ĕl Shaddai appeared to me at Luz in the land of Kena‛an and blessed
me, 
Gen
48:4  and said to me, ‘See, I am making
you bear fruit and shall increase you and make of you an assembly of peoples,
and give this land to your seed after you as an everlasting possession.’ 
Gen
48:5  “And now, your two sons, Ephrayim
and Menashsheh, who were born to you in the land of Mitsrayim before I came to
you in Mitsrayim, are mine – as Re’uḇĕn and Shim‛on, they are
mine. 
Gen
48:6  “Your offspring whom you shall
bring forth after them are yours, and let them be called by the name of their
brothers in their inheritance. 
Gen
48:7  “And I, when I came from Paddan,
Raḥĕl died beside me in the land of Kena‛an on the way, when
there was but a little distance to go to Ephrath. And I buried her there on the
way to Ephrath, that is Bĕyth Leḥem.” 
Gen
48:8  And Yisra’ĕl saw Yosĕph’s
sons, and said, “Who are these?” 
Gen
48:9  And Yosĕph said to his father,
“They are my sons, whom Elohim has given me in this place.” And he said, “Please
bring them to me, and let me bless them.” 
Gen
48:10  And the eyes of Yisra’ĕl were
dim with age, and he was unable to see. And he drew them near him, and he
kissed them and embraced them. 
Gen
48:11  And Yisra’ĕl said to Yosĕph,
“I had not thought to see your face. But see, Elohim has also shown me your
seed!” 
Gen
48:12  So Yosĕph brought them from
between his knees, and he bowed down with his face to the earth. 
Gen
48:13  And Yosĕph took them both,
Ephrayim with his right hand toward Yisra’ĕl’s left hand, and Menashsheh
with his left hand toward Yisra’ĕl’s right hand, and brought them near
him. 
Gen
48:14  And Yisra’ĕl stretched out
his right hand and laid it on Ephrayim’s head, who was the younger, and his
left hand on Menashsheh’s head, consciously directing his hands, for Menashsheh
was the first-born. 
Gen
48:15  And he blessed Yosĕph, and
said, “The Elohim before whom my fathers Aḇraham and Yitsḥaq
walked, the Elohim who has fed me all my life long to this day, 
Gen
48:16  the Messenger who has redeemed me
from all evil – bless the youths! And let my name be called upon them, and the
name of my fathers Aḇraham and Yitsḥaq. And let them increase to a
multitude in the midst of the earth.” 
Gen
48:17  And when Yosĕph saw that his
father laid his right hand on the head of Ephrayim, it was evil in his eyes;
and he took hold of his father’s hand to remove it from the head of Ephrayim to
the head of Menashsheh. 
Gen
48:18  And Yosĕph said to his
father, “Not so, my father, for this one is the first-born, put your right hand
on his head.” 
Gen
48:19  But his father refused and said, “I
know, my son, I know. He also becomes a people, and he also is great. And yet,
his younger brother is greater than he, and his seed is to become the
completeness of the nations.” 
Gen
48:20  And he blessed them on that day,
saying, “In you Yisra’ĕl shall bless, saying, ‘Elohim make you as Ephrayim
and as Menashsheh!’ ” Thus he put Ephrayim before Menashsheh. 
Gen
48:21  And Yisra’ĕl said to Yosĕph,
“See, I am dying, but Elohim shall be with you and bring you back to the land
of your fathers. 
Gen
48:22  “And I, I have given to you one
portion above your brothers, which I took from the hand of the Amorite with my
sword and with my bow.” 
Gen
49:1  And Ya‛aqoḇ called his
sons and said, “Gather together, so that I declare to you what is to befall you
in the last days: 
Gen
49:2  “Gather together and hear, you sons
of Ya‛aqoḇ, and listen to Yisra’ĕl your father. 
Gen
49:3  “Re’uḇĕn, you are my
first-born, my power and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of
exaltation and the excellency of power. 
Gen
49:4  “Boiling like water, you do not
excel, because you went up to your father’s bed, then you defiled it – he went
up to my couch. 
Gen
49:5  “Shim‛on and Lĕwi are
brothers, their weapons are implements of violence. 
Gen
49:6  “Let my being not enter their
council, let my esteem not be united to their assembly; because they slew a man
in their displeasure, and they lamed an ox in pleasure. 
Gen
49:7  “Cursed be their displeasure for it
is fierce, and their wrath for it is cruel! I divide them in Ya‛aqoḇ
and scatter them in Yisra’ĕl. 
Gen
49:8  “You, Yehuḏah, your brothers
praise you; your hand is on the neck of your enemies; your father’s children
bow down before you. 
Gen
49:9  “Yehuḏah is a lion’s cub;
from the prey you have gone up, my son! He bowed down, he crouched like a lion.
And like a lion, who does rouse him? 
Gen
49:10  “The sceptre shall not turn aside
from Yehuḏah, nor a Lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh comes,
and to Him is the obedience of peoples. 
Gen
49:11  “Binding his donkey to the vine,
and his donkey’s colt to the choice vine, he washed his garments in wine, and
his robes in the blood of grapes. 
Gen
49:12  “His eyes are darker than wine,
and his teeth whiter than milk. 
Gen
49:13  “Zeḇulun dwells at the
seashore, he is for a haven for ships, and his border is unto Tsiḏon. 
Gen
49:14  “Yissasḵar is a strong
donkey lying down between two burdens, 
Gen
49:15  and he saw that a resting place
was good, and that the land was pleasant, and he inclined his shoulder to bear
a burden, and became a subject to slave labour. 
Gen
49:16  “Dan rightly rules his people as
one of the tribes of Yisra’ĕl. 
Gen
49:17  “Dan is a serpent by the way, an
adder by the path, that bites the horse’s heels so that its rider falls
backward. 
Gen
49:18  “I have waited for your
deliverance, O יהוה ! 
Gen
49:19  “Gaḏ, a raiding band raids
him, but he raids its heel. 
Gen
49:20  “Bread from Ashĕr is rich,
and he gives delicacies of a sovereign. 
Gen
49:21  “Naphtali is a deer let loose, he
gives words of elegance. 
Gen
49:22  “Yosĕph is an offshoot of a
fruit-bearing tree, an offshoot of a fruit-bearing tree by a fountain, his
branches run over a wall. 
Gen
49:23  “And the archers have bitterly
grieved him, shot at him and hated him. 
Gen
49:24  “But his bow remained in strength,
and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the Mighty One of Ya‛aqoḇ
– from there is the Shepherd, the Stone of Yisra’ĕl – 
Gen
49:25  from the Ĕl of your father
who helps you, and by the Almighty who blesses you with blessings of the
heavens above, blessings of the deep that lies beneath, blessings of the
breasts and of the womb. 
Gen
49:26  “The blessings of your father have
excelled the blessings of my ancestors, up to the limit of the everlasting
hills. They are on the head of Yosĕph, and on the crown of the head of him
who was separated from his brothers. 
Gen
49:27  “Binyamin is a wolf that tears, in
the morning he eats prey, and at night he divides the spoil.” 
Gen
49:28  All these are the twelve tribes of
Yisra’ĕl, and this is what their father spoke to them. And he blessed
them, he blessed each one according to his own blessing. 
Gen
49:29  And he commanded them, and said to
them, “I am to be gathered to my people, bury me with my fathers in the cave
that is in the field of Ephron the Ḥittite, 
Gen
49:30  in the cave that is in the field
of Maḵpĕlah, which is before Mamrĕ in the land of Kena‛an,
which Aḇraham bought with the field of Ephron the Ḥittite as a
possession for a burial site. 
Gen
49:31  There they buried Aḇraham
and Sarah his wife, there they buried Yitsḥaq and Riḇqah his wife,
and there I buried Lĕ’ah – 
Gen
49:32  the field purchased, and the cave
which is in it, from the sons of Ḥĕth.” 
Gen
49:33  And when Ya‛aqoḇ ended
commanding his sons, he drew his feet up into the bed and breathed his last,
and was gathered to his people. 
Gen
50:1  And Yosĕph fell on his father’s
face, and wept over him, and kissed him. 
Gen
50:2  And Yosĕph commanded his
servants the physicians to embalm his father. So the physicians embalmed Yisra’ĕl.

Gen
50:3  And forty days were completed for
him, for so are completed the days of embalming. And the Mitsrites wept for him
seventy days. 
Gen
50:4  And when the days of weeping for
him were past, Yosĕph spoke to the household of Pharaoh, saying, “If, now,
I have found favour in your eyes, please speak in the hearing of Pharaoh,
saying, 
Gen
50:5  ‘My father made me swear, saying, “See,
I am dying, bury me in my grave which I dug for myself in the land of Kena‛an.”
And now, please let me go up and bury my father, and return.’ ” 
Gen
50:6  And Pharaoh said, “Go up and bury
your father, as he made you swear.” 
Gen
50:7  And Yosĕph went up to bury his
father. And with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his
house, and all the elders of the land of Mitsrayim, 
Gen
50:8  and all the house of Yosĕph,
and his brothers, and his father’s house. Only their little ones, and their
flocks, and their herds they left in the land of Goshen. 
Gen
50:9  And there went up with him both
chariots and horsemen, and it was a very great company. 
Gen
50:10  And they came to the
threshing-floor of Ataḏ, which is beyond the Yardĕn, and they
lamented there with a great and very heavy lamentation. And he observed seven
days of mourning for his father. 
Gen
50:11  And when the inhabitants of the
land, the Kena‛anites, saw the mourning at the threshing-floor of Ataḏ,
they said, “This is a grievous mourning for the Mitsrites.” That is why its
name was called Aḇĕl Mitsrayim, which is beyond the Yardĕn. 
Gen
50:12  And his sons did to him as he had
commanded them, 
Gen
50:13  for his sons brought him to the
land of Kena‛an, and buried him in the cave of the field of Maḵpĕlah,
before Mamrĕ, which Aḇraham bought with the field from Ephron the Ḥittite
as property for a burial site. 
Gen
50:14  And after he had buried his
father, Yosĕph returned to Mitsrayim, he and his brothers and all who went
up with him to bury his father. 
Gen
50:15  And when Yosĕph’s brothers
saw that their father was dead, they said, “What if Yosĕph hates us, and
pays us back all the evil which we did to him?” 
Gen
50:16  And they sent word to Yosĕph,
saying, “Before your father died he commanded, saying, 
Gen
50:17  ‘This is what you are to say to
Yosĕph, “I beg you, please forgive the transgression of your brothers and
their sin, for they did evil to you.” ’ And now, please forgive the
transgression of the servants of the Elohim of your father.” And Yosĕph
wept when they spoke to him. 
Gen
50:18  And his brothers also went and
fell down before his face, and they said, “See, we are your servants.” 
Gen
50:19  And Yosĕph said to them, “Do
not fear, for am I in the place of Elohim? 
Gen
50:20  “And you, you intended evil
against me, but Elohim intended it for good, in order to do it as it is this
day, to keep a great many people alive. 
Gen
50:21  “And now, do not fear, I provide
for you and your little ones.” So he comforted them and spoke kindly to them. 
Gen
50:22  And Yosĕph dwelt in
Mitsrayim, he and his father’s household. And Yosĕph lived one hundred and
ten years. 
Gen
50:23  And Yosĕph saw Ephrayim’s
children to the third generation. The children of Maḵir, son of
Menashsheh, were also brought up on Yosĕph’s knees. 
Gen
50:24  And Yosĕph said to his
brothers, “I am dying, but Elohim shall certainly visit you and bring you out
of this land to the land of which He swore to Aḇraham, to Yitsḥaq,
and to Ya‛aqoḇ.” 
Gen
50:25  And Yosĕph made the children
of Yisra’ĕl swear, saying, “Elohim shall certainly visit you, and you
shall bring up my bones from here.” 
Gen
50:26  And Yosĕph died, being one
hundred and ten years old. And they embalmed him, and he was placed in a coffin
in Mitsrayim.
