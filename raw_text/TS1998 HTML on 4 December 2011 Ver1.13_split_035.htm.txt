Yeḥezqĕl /Ezekiel
Ezek
1:1  And it came to be in the thirtieth
year, in the fourth month, on the fifth of the month, as I was among the exiles
by the River Keḇar, the heavens were opened and I saw visions of Elohim. 
Ezek
1:2  On the fifth of the month, in the
fifth year of Sovereign Yehoyaḵin’s exile, 
Ezek
1:3  the word of יהוה
came expressly to Yeḥezqĕl the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land
of the Chaldeans by the River Keḇar. And the hand of יהוה
came upon him there. 
Ezek
1:4  And I looked and saw a whirlwind
coming out of the north, a great cloud with fire flashing itself. And
brightness was all around it, and out of its midst like glowing metal, out of
the midst of the fire, 
Ezek
1:5  and out of the midst of it came what
looked like four living creatures. And this was their appearance: they had the
likeness of a man. 
Ezek
1:6  And each one had four faces, and
each one had four wings. 
Ezek
1:7  And their feet were straight feet,
and the soles of their feet were like the sole of a calves’ foot. And they
sparkled like the appearance of polished bronze, 
Ezek
1:8  and under their wings on their four
sides were the hands of a man. And each of the four had faces and wings – 
Ezek
1:9  their wings touched one another.
They did not turn when they went, but each one went straight forward. 
Ezek
1:10  And the likeness of their faces:
the face of a man, and each of the four had the face of a lion on the right
side, and each of the four had the face of an ox on the left side, and each of
the four had the face of an eagle. 
Ezek
1:11  Such were their faces. Their wings
were spread upward, two of each touched one another, and two covered their
bodies. 
Ezek
1:12  And each one went straight forward,
going wherever the spirit was to go, and they did not turn when they went. 
Ezek
1:13  And the likeness of the living creatures:
their appearance was like burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of
torches, moving back and forth among the living creatures. And the fire was
bright, and out of the fire went lightning. 
Ezek
1:14  And the living creatures ran back
and forth, like the appearance of a flash of lightning. 
Ezek
1:15  And I looked at the living
creatures, and saw a wheel on the earth beside each living creature with its
four faces. 
Ezek
1:16  The appearance of the wheels and
their works was like the appearance of beryl, and all four had the same form.
The appearance of their works was, as it were, a wheel in the middle of a
wheel. 
Ezek
1:17  When they went, they went in any
one of four directions, they did not turn aside when they went. 
Ezek
1:18  And their rims were high and
awesome, and their rims were covered with eyes, all around the four of them. 
Ezek
1:19  And when the living creatures went,
the wheels went beside them. And when the living creatures were lifted up from
the earth, the wheels were lifted up. 
Ezek
1:20  Wherever the spirit was to go, they
went, because there the spirit went. And the wheels were lifted together with
them, for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels. 
Ezek
1:21  When those went, these went; when
those stood, these stood. And when those were lifted up from the earth, the
wheels were lifted up together with them, for the spirit of the living
creatures was in the wheels. 
Ezek
1:22  And a likeness was over the heads
of the living creatures, an expanse like the appearance of an awesome crystal,
stretched out over their heads. 
Ezek
1:23  And under the expanse their wings
were straight, one toward another. Each one had two which covered one side, and
each one had two which covered the other side of the body. 
Ezek
1:24  And when they went, I heard the
noise of their wings, like the noise of many waters, like the voice of the
Almighty, a tumult like the noise of an army. And when they stood still, they
let down their wings. 
Ezek
1:25  And a voice came from above the
expanse that was over their heads. When they stood, they dropped their wings. 
Ezek
1:26  And above the expanse over their
heads was the likeness of a throne, in appearance like a sapphire stone. And on
the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man high above
it. 
Ezek
1:27  And from the appearance of His
waist and upward I saw what looked like glowing metal with the appearance of
fire all around within it. And from the appearance of His waist and downward I
saw what looked like fire, and brightness all around. 
Ezek
1:28  As the appearance of a rainbow in a
cloud on a rainy day, so was the appearance of the brightness all around it.
This was the appearance of the likeness of the esteem of יהוה.
And when I saw it, I fell on my face, and I heard a voice of One speaking.
Ezek
2:1  And He said to me, “Son of man,
stand on your feet, so that I speak to you.” 
Ezek
2:2  And the Spirit entered into me when
He spoke to me, and set me on my feet. And I heard Him who was speaking to me. 
Ezek
2:3  And He said to me, “Son of man, I am
sending you to the children of Yisra’ĕl, to a nation of rebels who have
rebelled against Me. They and their fathers have transgressed against Me, until
this day. 
Ezek
2:4  “And the children are stiff of face
and hard of heart to whom I am sending you, and you shall say to them, ‘Thus
said the Master יהוה.’ 
Ezek
2:5  “And they – whether they hear or
whether they refuse, for they are a rebellious house – shall know that a
prophet has been in their midst. 
Ezek
2:6  “And you, son of man, do not be
afraid of them, nor be afraid of their words, though thistles and thorns are
with you and you dwell among scorpions. Do not be afraid of their words or
discouraged by their looks, for they are a rebellious house. 
Ezek
2:7  “And you shall speak My words to
them, whether they hear or whether they refuse, for they are rebellious. 
Ezek
2:8  “And you, son of man, hear what I am
speaking to you. Do not be rebellious like that rebellious house, open your
mouth and eat what I am giving you.” 
Ezek
2:9  And I looked and saw a hand
stretched out to me. And see, a scroll of a book was in it, 
Ezek
2:10  and He spread it before me, and it
was written on the inside and on the outside. And written on it were
lamentations and mourning and woe. 
Ezek
3:1  And He said to me, “Son of man, eat
what you find, eat this scroll, and go, speak to the house of Yisra’ĕl.” 
Ezek
3:2  And I opened my mouth, and He fed me
the scroll. 
Ezek
3:3  And He said to me, “Son of man, feed
your stomach, and fill your stomach with this scroll that I am giving you.” And
I ate it, and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth.
Ezek
3:4  And He said to me, “Son of man, go
to the house of Yisra’ĕl, and you shall speak to them with My words. 
Ezek
3:5  “For you are not sent to a people of
foreign speech and of difficult language, but to the house of Yisra’ĕl, 
Ezek
3:6  not to many people of foreign speech
and of difficult language, whose words you do not understand. If I had rather
sent you to them, they would have listened to you. 
Ezek
3:7  “But the house of Yisra’ĕl is
going to refuse to listen to you, for they refuse to listen to Me. For all the
house of Yisra’ĕl are hard of head, and hard of heart. 
Ezek
3:8  “See, I shall make your face as hard
as their faces and your forehead as hard as their foreheads. 
Ezek
3:9  “Like adamant stone, harder than
flint, I shall make your forehead. Do not be afraid of them, nor be discouraged
at their looks, for they are a rebellious house.” 
Ezek
3:10  And He said to me, “Son of man,
receive into your heart all My words that I speak to you, and hear with your
ears.
Ezek
3:11  “And go! Come to the exiles, to the
children of your people, and speak to them and say to them, ‘Thus said the
Master יהוה,’ whether they hear, or whether they refuse.”

Ezek
3:12  And the Spirit lifted me up, and
behind me I heard the sound of a great rumbling voice, “Blessed be the esteem of יהוה from
His place,” 
Ezek
3:13  and the sound of the wings of the
living creatures touching one another, and the sound of the wheels beside them,
and the sound of a great rushing. 
Ezek
3:14  And the Spirit lifted me and took
me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit, while the hand of יהוה
was strong upon me. 
Ezek
3:15  And I came to the exiles at Tĕl
Aḇiḇ, who were dwelling by the River Keḇar. And I sat where
they were sitting, and sat there, stunned among them, seven days. 
Ezek
3:16  And it came to be at the end of
seven days that the word of יהוה came to me, saying, 
Ezek
3:17  “Son of man, I have made you a
watchman for the house of Yisra’ĕl. And you shall hear a word from My
mouth, and shall warn them from Me. 
Ezek
3:18  “When I say to the wrong, ‘You
shall certainly die,’ and you have not warned him, nor spoken to warn the wrong
from his wrong way, to save his life, that same wrong man shall die in his
crookedness, and his blood I require at your hand.
Ezek
3:19  “But if you have warned the wrong
and he does not turn from his wrong, nor from his wrong way, he shall die in
his crookedness, and you have delivered your being. 
Ezek
3:20  “And when a righteous one turns
from his righteousness and shall do unrighteousness, when I have put a
stumbling-block before him, he shall die. Because you did not warn him, he
shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he has done is not
remembered, and his blood I require at your hand. 
Ezek
3:21  “But if you have warned the
righteous one that the righteous should not sin, and he did not sin, he shall
certainly live because he has been warned, and you have delivered your being.” 
Ezek
3:22  And the hand of יהוה
came upon me there, and He said to me, “Arise, go out into the plain, so that I
might speak to you there.” 
Ezek
3:23  So I got up and went out into the
plain, and see, the esteem of יהוה stood there, like
the esteem which I saw by the River Keḇar, and I fell on my face. 
Ezek
3:24  And the Spirit entered me and set
me on my feet, and spoke with me and said to me, “Go, shut yourself inside your
house. 
Ezek
3:25  “And you, O son of man, see, they
shall put cords on you and bind you with them, so that you do not go out in
their midst. 
Ezek
3:26  “And I make your tongue stick to
the roof of your mouth, so that you shall be dumb and not be a reprover to
them, for they are a rebellious house. 
Ezek
3:27  “But when I speak with you, I open
your mouth, and you shall say to them, ‘Thus said the Master יהוה.’
He who hears, let him hear. And he who refuses, let him refuse, for they are a
rebellious house. 
Ezek
4:1  “And you, son of man, take a clay
tablet, and you shall lay it before you, and shall inscribe on it a city,
Yerushalayim, 
Ezek
4:2  and shall lay siege against it, and
build a siege wall against it, and heap up a mound against it, and set camps
against it, and place battering rams against it all around. 
Ezek
4:3  “Then take an iron plate, and set it
as an iron wall between you and the city. And you shall set your face against
it, and it shall be besieged, and you shall lay siege against it. It is a sign
to the house of Yisra’ĕl. 
Ezek
4:4  “And lie on your left side, and you
shall put the crookedness of the house of Yisra’ĕl on it. As many days as
you lie on it, you shall bear their crookedness. 
Ezek
4:5  “For I Myself have laid on you the
years of their crookedness, according to the number of the days, three hundred
and ninety days. And you shall bear the crookedness of the house of Yisra’ĕl.

Ezek
4:6  “And when you have completed them,
you shall lie again on your right side and shall bear the crookedness of the
house of Yehuḏah forty days, a day for a year. I have laid on you a day
for a year. 
Ezek
4:7  “Then you shall set your face toward
the siege of Yerushalayim, with your arm bared, and you shall prophesy against
it. 
Ezek
4:8  “And see, I shall put cords on you
so that you do not turn from one side to another untill you have completed the
days of your siege. 
Ezek
4:9  “And take wheat, and barley, and
beans, and lentils, and millet, and spelt. And you shall put them into one
vessel, and make bread of them. You shall eat it, as many days as you lie on
your side, three hundred and ninety days. 
Ezek
4:10  “And your food which you eat is by
weight, twenty sheqels a day, to be eaten from time to time. 
Ezek
4:11  “And drink water by measure,
one-sixth of a hin, to be drunk from time to time. 
Ezek
4:12  “And eat it as a barley cake. And
bake it, before their eyes, on human dung.” 
Ezek
4:13  And יהוה
said, “Even so the children of Yisra’ĕl shall eat their defiled bread
among the gentiles, to whom I drive them.” 
Ezek
4:14  Then I said, “Ah, Master יהוה
! See, I have never defiled myself from my youth till now. I have never eaten
what died of itself or was torn by beasts, nor has unclean meat ever come into
my mouth.” 
Ezek
4:15  And He said to me, “See, I am
giving you the dung of cattle instead of human dung, and you shall prepare your
bread over it.” 
Ezek
4:16  And He said to me, “Son of man,
see, I am going to cut off the supply of bread in Yerushalayim, and they shall
eat bread by weight and with fear, and drink water by measure and with dread, 
Ezek
4:17  so that they lack bread and water,
and shall be appalled with one another, and be consumed in their crookedness. 
Ezek
5:1  “And you, son of man, take a sharp
sword, take it as a barber’s razor, and you shall pass it over your head and
your beard. And you shall take scales to weigh and divide the hair. 
Ezek
5:2  “Burn with fire one-third in the
midst of the city when the days of the siege are completed. And you shall take
one-third and strike around it with the sword, and scatter one-third in the
wind. And I shall draw out a sword after them. 
Ezek
5:3  “And you shall take a few hairs from there and bind them in the
edge of your garment. 
Ezek
5:4  “And take again some of them, and
throw them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire. From it a
fire shall spread unto all the house of Yisra’ĕl. 
Ezek
5:5  “Thus said the Master יהוה,
‘This is Yerushalayim which I have set in the midst of the gentiles, with the other lands all around her. 
Ezek
5:6  ‘But she rebelled against My
rightrulings, doing wrong, more than the gentiles, and My laws more than the
lands all around her. For they have rejected My right-rulings, and they have
not walked in My laws.’ 
Ezek
5:7  “Therefore thus said the Master יהוה,
‘Because you have rebelled more than the gentiles all around you, and have not
walked in My laws, nor done My right-rulings, nor even done according to the
right-rulings of the gentiles all around you,’ 
Ezek
5:8  therefore thus said the Master יהוה,
‘Look I Myself am against you and shall execute judgments in your midst before
the eyes of the gentiles. 
Ezek
5:9  ‘And I shall do among you what I
have never done, and the like of which I never do again, because of all your
abominations. 
Ezek
5:10  ‘Therefore fathers are going to eat
their sons in your midst, and sons eat their fathers. And I shall execute
judgments among you and scatter all your remnant to all the winds. 
Ezek
5:11  ‘Therefore, as I live,’ declares
the Master יהוה, ‘because you have defiled My set-apart
place with all your disgusting matters
and with all your abominations, therefore I also withdraw. And My eye shall not
pardon, nor shall I spare. 
Ezek
5:12  ‘One-third of you shall die of
pestilence, and be consumed with scarcity of food in your midst. And one-third
shall fall by the sword all around you. And I shall scatter another third to
all the winds, and draw out a sword after them. 
Ezek
5:13  ‘And My displeasure shall be
completed. And I shall bring My wrath to rest upon them, and I shall be eased.
And they shall know that I, יהוה, have spoken it in My
ardour, when I have completed My wrath upon them. 
Ezek
5:14  ‘And I shall make you a waste and a
reproach among the gentiles that are all around you, before the eyes of all who
pass by. 
Ezek
5:15  ‘And it shall be a reproach, an
object of scorn, a warning, and an astonishment to the gentiles that are all
around you, when I execute judgments among you in displeasure and in wrath and
in heated chastisements. I, יהוה, have spoken.
Ezek
5:16  ‘When I send against them the evil
arrows of scarcity of food which shall be for their destruction, which I send
to destroy you, I shall increase the scarcity of food upon you and cut off your
supply of bread. 
Ezek
5:17  ‘And I shall send against you
scarcity of food and evil beasts, and they shall bereave you. And pestilence
and blood shall pass through you, while I bring the sword against you. I, יהוה,
have spoken.’ ” 
Ezek
6:1  And the word of יהוה
came to me, saying, 
Ezek
6:2  “Son of man, set your face toward
the mountains of Yisra’ĕl, and prophesy against them. 
Ezek
6:3  “And you shall say, ‘O mountains of
Yisra’ĕl, hear the word of the Master יהוה !’ Thus
said the Master יהוה to the mountains, to the hills, to
the ravines, and to the valleys, “Look, I Myself am bringing a sword against
you, and I shall destroy your high places. 
Ezek
6:4  “And your altars shall be ruined,
your sun-pillars shall be broken in pieces. And I shall make your slain fall in
front of your idols, 
Ezek
6:5  and lay the corpses of the children
of Yisra’ĕl in front of their idols, and scatter your bones all around
your altars. 
Ezek
6:6  “In all your dwelling places the
cities shall be destroyed and the high places deserted, so that your altars are
broken and bear their punishment. And your idols shall be smashed and made to
cease, and your sun-pillars cut down, and your works blotted out. 
Ezek
6:7  “And the slain shall fall in your
midst, and you shall know that I am יהוה. 
Ezek
6:8  “But I shall leave a remnant, in
that some of you shall escape the sword among the gentiles, when you are
scattered throughout the lands. 
Ezek
6:9  “And those of you who escape shall
remember Me among the gentiles where they have been taken captive, because I
have been broken by their adulterous heart which has turned away from Me, and
by their eyes which whored after their idols. And they shall loathe themselves
for the evils which they have done in all their abominations. 
Ezek
6:10  “And they shall know that I am יהוה,
and not for naught have I spoken to do this evil to them.” 
Ezek
6:11  ‘Thus said the Master יהוה,
“Strike with your hand and stamp your feet, and say, ‘Alas, because of all the
evil abominations of the house of Yisra’ĕl who shall fall by sword, by
scarcity of food, and by pestilence!
Ezek
6:12  ‘He who is far off shall die by
pestilence, he who is near fall by the sword, and he who is left over and is
besieged die by scarcity of food. And I shall complete My wrath upon them. 
Ezek
6:13  ‘And you shall know that I am יהוה,
when their slain are among their idols all around their altars, on every high
hill, on all the mountaintops, under every green tree, and under every thick
oak, wherever they offered sweet incense to all their idols. 
Ezek
6:14  ‘And I shall stretch out My hand
against them and make the land a wasteland, even more waste than the wilderness
toward Diḇlah, in all their dwelling places. And they shall know that I
am יהוה.’ ” ’ ” 
Ezek
7:1  And the word of יהוה
came to me, saying, 
Ezek
7:2  “And you, son of man, this is what
the Master יהוה said to the land of Yisra’ĕl, ‘An
end! The end has come upon the four corners of the land. 
Ezek
7:3  ‘Now the end is upon you, and I
shall send My displeasure against you, and judge you according to your ways,
and repay you for all your abominations. 
Ezek
7:4  ‘And My eye shall not pardon you,
nor would I spare, for I repay your ways while your abominations are in your
midst. And you shall know that I am יהוה !’ 
Ezek
7:5  “Thus said the Master יהוה,
‘A calamity, an only calamity, look, it has come! 
Ezek
7:6  ‘An end has come, the end has come!
It has awakened against you, look, it has come! 
Ezek
7:7  ‘The turn has come to you, O
inhabitants of the land. The time has come, a day of uproar is near, and not of
rejoicing in the mountains. 
Ezek
7:8  ‘Soon I shall pour out My wrath, and
shall complete My displeasure upon you, and judge you according to your ways,
and repay you for all your abominations. 
Ezek
7:9  ‘And My eye shall not pardon, nor
would I spare. I give you according to your ways while your abominations are in
your midst. And you shall know that I am יהוה who
smites. 
Ezek
7:10  ‘See, the day! See, it has come!
The turn has come, the rod has blossomed, pride has budded. 
Ezek
7:11  ‘The violence has grown into a rod
of wrongdoing. There is none of them, and none of its crowd, and none of their
riches, and none eminent among them. 
Ezek
7:12  ‘The time has come, and the day has arrived. ‘Let not the
buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn, for wrath is on all its crowd. 
Ezek
7:13  ‘For the seller shall not return to
what has been sold, though they are still alive. For the vision is for all its
crowd – it shall not turn back. And because of his crookedness no one holds
fast to his life. 
Ezek
7:14  ‘They have blown the trumpet and
all is prepared, but no one goes to battle, for My wrath is on all its crowd. 
Ezek
7:15  ‘The sword is outside, and the
pestilence and the scarcity of food inside. He who is in the field dies by the
sword, and he who is in a city, scarcity of food and pestilence devour him, 
Ezek
7:16  while they who escape of them shall
escape and be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning,
each for his crookedness. 
Ezek
7:17  ‘All hands go limp, and all knees
become as water. 
Ezek
7:18  ‘And they shall gird on sackcloth,
and be covered with trembling. And shame shall be on every face, and baldness
on all their heads. 
Ezek
7:19  ‘They throw their silver into the
streets, and their gold becomes as filth. Their silver and their gold is unable
to deliver them in the day of the wrath of יהוה. They
do not satisfy their appetite, nor fill their stomachs, because it has been
their stumbling-block of crookedness. 
Ezek
7:20  ‘And the splendour of His
ornaments, He set it in excellency. But they made from it the images of their
abominations and their disgusting matters.
Therefore I shall make it like filth to them. 
Ezek
7:21  ‘And I shall give it for a prey
into the hands of strangers, and to the wrong of the earth for a spoil, and
they shall profane it. 
Ezek
7:22  ‘And I shall turn My face from
them. And they shall profane My secret place, for destroyers shall enter it and
profane it. 
Ezek
7:23  ‘Make a chain, for the land has
been filled with crimes of blood, and the city has been filled with violence. 
Ezek
7:24  ‘And I shall bring the evil ones of
the gentiles, and they shall possess their houses. And I shall cause the pride
of the strong to cease, and their set-apart places shall be profaned. 
Ezek
7:25  ‘Destruction shall come. And they
shall seek peace, but there is none. 
Ezek
7:26  ‘Calamity upon calamity shall come,
and report shall be upon report. And they shall seek a vision from a prophet.
But the teaching has perished from the priest, and counsel from the elders! 
Ezek
7:27  ‘Let the sovereign mourn, and let
the prince put on despair, and let the hands of the common people tremble. And
I shall deal with them according to their way, and judge them with their own
right-rulings. And they shall know that I am יהוה !’ ” 
Ezek
8:1  And it came to be in the sixth year,
in the sixth month, on the fifth of the month, as I sat in my house with the
elders of Yehuḏah sitting before me, that the hand of the Master יהוה
fell upon me there. 
Ezek
8:2  And I looked and saw a likeness,
like the appearance of fire. From His waist and downward the appearance was
like fire, and from His waist and upward the appearance of brightness, like
glowing metal. 
Ezek
8:3  And He stretched out the form of a
hand, and took me by a lock of my hair. And the Spirit lifted me up between the
earth and the heavens, and brought me in visions of Elohim to Yerushalayim, to
the door of the north gate of the inner court, where the seat of the image of
jealousy was, which causes jealousy. 
Ezek
8:4  And see, the esteem of the Elohim of
Yisra’ĕl was there, like the vision that I saw in the plain. 
Ezek
8:5  And He said to me, “Son of man,
please lift your eyes toward the north.” And I lifted my eyes northward, and
north of the altar gate I saw this image of jealousy in the entrance. 
Ezek
8:6  And He said to me, “Son of man, do
you see what they are doing, the great abominations which the house of Yisra’ĕl
are doing here, driving Me away from My set-apart place? And you are to see
still greater abominations.” 
Ezek
8:7  Then He brought me to the door of
the court. And I looked and saw a hole in the wall. 
Ezek
8:8  And He said to me, “Son of man,
please dig into the wall.” And when I dug into the wall I saw a door. 
Ezek
8:9  And He said to me, “Go in, and see
the evil abominations which they are doing there.”
Ezek
8:10  And I went in and looked and saw
all kinds of creeping creatures, abominable beasts, and all the idols of the
house of Yisra’ĕl, carved all around on the walls. 
Ezek
8:11  And facing them stood seventy men
of the elders of the house of Yisra’ĕl, and in their midst stood Ya‛azanyahu
son of Shaphan. Each one had a censer in his hand, and a thick cloud of incense
went up. 
Ezek
8:12  And He said to me, “Son of man,
have you seen what the elders of the house of Yisra’ĕl are doing in the
dark, each one in the room of his idols? For they say, ‘ יהוה
does not see us, יהוה has forsaken the land.’ ” 
Ezek
8:13  And He said to me, “You are to see
still greater abominations which they are doing.” 
Ezek
8:14  And He brought me to the door of
the north gate of the House of יהוה, and I saw women
sitting there, weeping for Tammuz. 
Ezek
8:15  Then He said to me, “Have you seen
this, O son of man? You are to see still greater abominations than these.” 
Ezek
8:16  And He brought me into the inner
court of the House of יהוה. And there, at the door of
the Hĕḵal of יהוה, between the porch and the
altar, were about twenty-five men with their backs toward the Hĕḵal
of יהוה and their faces toward the east, and they were
bowing themselves eastward to the sun. 
Ezek
8:17  And He said to me, “Have you seen,
O son of man? Is it a small matter to the house of Yehuḏah to do the
abominations which they have done here? For they have filled the land with
violence, and turn back to provoke Me. And see, they are putting the branch to
My nose. 
Ezek
8:18  “Therefore I shall indeed deal in
wrath. My eye shall not pardon nor would I spare. And they shall cry in My ears
with a loud voice, but I shall not hear them.” 
Ezek
9:1  And He called out in my hearing with
a loud voice, saying, “Let the punishers of the city draw near, each with his
weapon of destruction in his hand.” 
Ezek
9:2  And look, six men came from the
direction of the upper gate, which faces north, each with his battle-axe in his
hand. And one man in their midst was clothed with linen and had a writer’s
ink-horn at his side. And they came in and stood beside the bronze altar. 
Ezek
9:3  And the esteem of the Elohim of
Yisra’ĕl went up from the keruḇ, where it had been, to the threshold
of the House. And He called to the man clothed with linen, who had the writer’s
ink-horn at his side, 
Ezek
9:4  and יהוה
said to him, “Pass on into the midst of the city, into the midst of
Yerushalayim, and you shall put a mark on the foreheads of the men who sigh and
cry over all the abominations that are done within it.” 
Ezek
9:5  And to the others He said in my
hearing, “Pass on into the city after him and smite, do not let your eye pardon
nor spare. 
Ezek
9:6  “Slay to destruction old, young men,
maidens and children and women, but do not come near anyone upon whom is the
mark, and begin at My set-apart place.” So they began with the elders who were
in front of the House. 
Ezek
9:7  And He said to them, “Defile the
House, and fill the courts with the slain. Go out!” And they went out and smote
in the city. 
Ezek
9:8  And as they were smiting them it
came to be that I alone was left. And I fell on my face and cried out, and
said, “Ah, Master יהוה ! Are You destroying all the
remnant of Yisra’ĕl in pouring out Your wrath on Yerushalayim?” 
Ezek
9:9  And He said to me, “The crookedness
of the house of Yisra’ĕl and Yehuḏah is exceedingly great, and the
land is filled with bloodshed, and the city filled with that which is warped.
For they say, ‘ יהוה has forsaken the land, and יהוה
is not seeing!’ 
Ezek
9:10  “But as for Me, My eye shall not
pardon, nor would I spare, I shall recompense their deeds on their own head.” 
Ezek
9:11  And see, the man clothed with
linen, who had the ink-horn at his side, reported back and said, “I have done
as You commanded me.” 
Ezek
10:1  And I looked and saw in the expanse
that was above the head of the keruḇim, like a sapphire stone, having the
appearance of the likeness of a throne. 
Ezek
10:2  And He spoke to the man clothed
with linen, and said, “Go in among the wheels, under the keruḇ, and fill
your hands with coals of fire from among the keruḇim, and scatter over
the city.” And he went in before my eyes. 
Ezek
10:3  And the keruḇim were standing
on the south side of the House when the man went in, and the cloud filled the
inner court. 
Ezek
10:4  And the esteem of יהוה
went up from the keruḇ, over the threshold of the House. And the House
was filled with the cloud, and the court was filled with the brightness of the
esteem of יהוה. 
Ezek
10:5  And the sound of the wings of the
keruḇim was heard in the outer court, like the voice of Ĕl Shaddai
when He speaks. 
Ezek
10:6  And it came to be, when He
commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, “Take fire from among the wheels,
from among the keruḇim,” that he went in and stood beside the wheel. 
Ezek
10:7  And the keruḇ stretched out
his hand from among the keruḇim to the fire that was among the keruḇim,
and took some, and put it into the hands of the man clothed with linen, who
took it and went out. 
Ezek
10:8  And the form of a man’s hand was
seen under the wings of the keruḇim. 
Ezek
10:9  And I looked and saw four wheels
beside the keruḇim, one wheel beside each keruḇ, and the wheels’
appearance was like the colour of beryl stone. 
Ezek
10:10  As for their appearance, all four
looked alike; as if a wheel in the middle of a wheel. 
Ezek
10:11  When they went, they went on their
four sides; they did not turn aside when they went, but went in the direction
the head was facing. They did not turn aside when they went. 
Ezek
10:12  And their entire bodies, and their
backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels that the four had, were
covered with eyes all around. 
Ezek
10:13  The wheels were called in my
hearing, “Wheel.” 
Ezek
10:14  And each one had four faces: the
first face was the face of a keruḇ, and the second face the face of a
man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.
Ezek
10:15  And the keruḇim were lifted
up – it was the living creature I saw by the River Keḇar. 
Ezek
10:16  And when the keruḇim went
the wheels went beside them. And when the keruḇim lifted their wings to
mount up from the earth, the same wheels also did not turn from beside them. 
Ezek
10:17  When they stood still, the wheels
stood still, and when one was lifted up, the other lifted itself up, for the
spirit of the living creature was in them. 
Ezek
10:18  And the esteem of יהוה
went from the threshold of the House and stood over the keruḇim. 
Ezek
10:19  And the keruḇim lifted their
wings and rose from the earth before my eyes. When they went out, the wheels
were beside them. And it stood at the door of the east gate of the House of יהוה,
and the esteem of the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl was above them. 
Ezek
10:20  It was the living creature I saw
under the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl by the River Keḇar, and I knew they
were keruḇim. 
Ezek
10:21  Each one had four faces and each
one four wings, and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings. 
Ezek
10:22  And the likeness of their faces
was the same as the faces which I had seen by the River Keḇar, their
appearances and themselves. Each one went straight forward. 
Ezek
11:1  And the Spirit lifted me up and
brought me to the east gate of the House of יהוה, which
faces east. And see, at the door of the gate were twenty-five men, among whom I
saw Ya‛azanyah son of Azzur, and Pelatyahu son of Benayahu, heads of the
people. 
Ezek
11:2  And He said to me, “Son of man,
these are the men who plot wickedness and give evil counsel in this city, 
Ezek
11:3  who are saying, ‘It is not near,
let us build houses. This city is the
cooking pot, and we are the meat.’ 
Ezek
11:4  “Therefore prophesy against them,
prophesy, O son of man!” 
Ezek
11:5  And the Spirit of יהוה
fell upon me, and said to me, “Speak! ‘Thus said יהוה, “Thus
you have said, O house of Yisra’ĕl. For I know what comes up in your
spirit. 
Ezek
11:6  “You have increased your slain in
this city, and filled its streets with the slain.” 
Ezek
11:7  ‘Therefore thus said the Master יהוה,
“Your slain whom you have laid in its midst, they are the meat, and this city
is the cooking pot. But I shall bring you out of the midst of it. 
Ezek
11:8  “You have feared the sword, and I
bring a sword upon you,” declares the Master יהוה. 
Ezek
11:9  “And I shall bring you out of its
midst, and give you into the hands of strangers, and execute judgments on you. 
Ezek
11:10  “By the sword you fall. At the
border of Yisra’ĕl I judge you. And you shall know that I am יהוה.

Ezek
11:11  “This city is not your cooking pot, nor are you the meat in its midst. At
the border of Yisra’ĕl I judge you. 
Ezek
11:12  “And you shall know that I am יהוה,
for you have not walked in My laws nor executed My right-rulings, but have done
according to the rulings of the gentiles which are all around you.” ’ ”
Ezek
11:13  And it came to be, while I was
prophesying, that Pelatyahu son of Benayah died. And I fell on my face and
cried out with a loud voice, and said, “Ah, Master יהוה
! Are You making an end of the remnant of Yisra’ĕl?” 
Ezek
11:14  Then the word of יהוה
came to me, saying, 
Ezek
11:15  “Son of man, your brothers, your
relatives, your kinsmen, and all the house of Yisra’ĕl, all of it, are
those about whom the inhabitants of Yerushalayim said, ‘Keep far from יהוה,
this land has been given to us as a possession.’ 
Ezek
11:16  “Therefore say, ‘Thus said the
Master יהוה, “Although I have sent them far off among
the gentiles, and although I have scattered them among the lands, yet I was for
them a set-apart place for a little while in the lands to which they came.” ’ 
Ezek
11:17  “Therefore say, ‘Thus said the
Master יהוה, “And I shall gather you from the peoples,
and I shall assemble you from the lands where you have been scattered, and I
shall give you the land of Yisra’ĕl.” ’ 
Ezek
11:18  “And they shall go there, and
shall take away all its disgusting matters
and all its abominations from there. 
Ezek
11:19  “And I shall give them one heart,
and put a new spirit within you. And I shall take the stony heart out of their
flesh, and give them a heart of flesh, 
Ezek
11:20  so that they walk in My laws, and
guard My right-rulings, and shall do them. And they shall be My people and I
shall be their Elohim. 
Ezek
11:21  “But to those whose hearts walk
after the heart of their disgusting matters
and their abominations, I shall recompense their deeds on their own heads,”
declares the Master יהוה. 
Ezek
11:22  And the keruḇim lifted up
their wings, with the wheels beside them, and the esteem of the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl
was high above them. 
Ezek
11:23  And the esteem of יהוה
went up from the midst of the city and stood upon the mountain, which is on the
east side of the city. 
Ezek
11:24  And the Spirit lifted me up and
brought me in a vision by the Spirit of Elohim into Chaldea, to those in exile.
And the vision that I had seen went up from me. 
Ezek
11:25  And I spoke to those in exile of
all the words of יהוה which He had shown me. 
Ezek
12:1  And the word of יהוה
came to me, saying, 
Ezek
12:2  “Son of man, you are dwelling in
the midst of a rebellious house. They have eyes to see but they have not seen,
they have ears to hear but they have not heard, for they are a rebellious
house. 
Ezek
12:3  “Therefore, son of man, prepare
your baggage for exile, and go into exile by day before their eyes. And you
shall go from your place into exile to another place before their eyes. It
could be that they see, though they are a rebellious house. 
Ezek
12:4  “And you shall bring out your
baggage for exile before their eyes by day, and at evening go before their
eyes, like those who go into exile. 
Ezek
12:5  “Dig through the wall before their
eyes, and you shall bring them out
through it – 
Ezek
12:6  take them on your shoulders and
bring them out at dark before their eyes. Cover your face, so that you do not
see the land, for I have made you a sign to the house of Yisra’ĕl.” 
Ezek
12:7  And so I did, as I was commanded. I
brought out my baggage for exile by day, and at evening I dug through the wall
with my hand. I brought them out at dark, and I took them on my shoulder before
their eyes. 
Ezek
12:8  And in the morning the word of יהוה
came to me, saying, 
Ezek
12:9  “Son of man, did not the house of
Yisra’ĕl, the rebellious house, say to you, ‘What are you doing?’ 
Ezek
12:10  “Say to them, ‘Thus said the
Master יהוה, “This message is to the prince in
Yerushalayim and all the house of Yisra’ĕl who are in their midst.” ’ 
Ezek
12:11  “Say, ‘I am a sign to you. As I
have done, so it is done to them – they are to go into exile, into captivity.’ 
Ezek
12:12  “And the prince who is in their
midst is to bear his baggage on his shoulder at dark and go out. They are to
dig through the wall to bring them out through it. He is to cover his face, so
that he does not see the land with his eyes. 
Ezek
12:13  “And I shall spread My net over
him, and he shall be caught in My snare. And I shall bring him to Baḇel,
the land of the Chaldeans, but he shall not see it, and yet die there. 
Ezek
12:14  “And I shall scatter to every wind
all who are around him to help him, and all his bands, and I shall draw out the
sword after them. 
Ezek
12:15  “And they shall know that I am יהוה,
when I scatter them among the gentiles. And I shall disperse them throughout
the lands. 
Ezek
12:16  “But I shall let a few of their
men escape from the sword, from scarcity of food, and from pestilence, so that
they recount all their abominations among the gentiles wherever they go. And
they shall know that I am יהוה.” 
Ezek
12:17  And the word of יהוה
came to me, saying, 
Ezek
12:18  “Son of man, eat your bread with
trembling, and drink your water with fear and with anxiety. 
Ezek
12:19  “And you shall say to the people
of the land, ‘Thus said the Master יהוה to the
inhabitants of Yerushalayim and to the land of Yisra’ĕl, “Let them eat
their bread with anxiety, and drink their water with astonishment, for her land
is emptied of all who are in it, because of the violence of all those who dwell
in it. 
Ezek
12:20  “And the cities that are inhabited
shall be laid waste, and the land shall become a wasteland. And you shall know
that I am יהוה.” ’ ”
Ezek
12:21  And the word of יהוה
came to me, saying, 
Ezek
12:22  “Son of man, what is this proverb
that you people have about the land of Yisra’ĕl, which says, ‘The days go
by, and every vision shall come to naught’? 
Ezek
12:23  “Therefore say to them, ‘Thus said
the Master יהוה, “I shall make this proverb to cease,
so that they no longer use it as a proverb in Yisra’ĕl.” But say to them, “The
days have drawn near, as well as the matter of every vision. 
Ezek
12:24  “For no longer is there to be any
false vision or flattering divination within the house of Yisra’ĕl. 
Ezek
12:25  “For I am יהוה,
I speak. And the word which I speak is done. It is no longer deferred. For in
your days, O rebellious house, when I speak the word I shall do it,” declares
the Master יהוה.’ ” 
Ezek
12:26  Again the word of יהוה
came to me, saying, 
Ezek
12:27  “Son of man, see, the house of
Yisra’ĕl is saying, ‘The vision that he is seeing is for many days from
now, and he is prophesying of times far off.’ 
Ezek
12:28  “Therefore say to them, ‘Thus said
the Master יהוה, “None of My words are deferred any
longer. When I speak a word it is done,” declares the Master יהוה.’
” 
Ezek
13:1  And the word of יהוה
came to me, saying, 
Ezek
13:2  “Son of man, prophesy against the
prophets of Yisra’ĕl who prophesy, and say to those who prophesy out of
their own heart, ‘Hear the word of יהוה !’ ” 
Ezek
13:3  Thus said the Master יהוה,
“Woe to the foolish prophets, who are following their own spirit, without
having had a vision! 
Ezek
13:4  “O Yisra’ĕl, your prophets
have been like foxes among ruins. 
Ezek
13:5  “You have not gone up into the
breaches, nor do you build a wall for the house of Yisra’ĕl to stand in
battle on the day of יהוה. 
Ezek
13:6  “Their visions are false and their
divinations a lie, saying, ‘Thus declares יהוה,’ when יהוה
has not sent them, yet they expected the word to be confirmed! 
Ezek
13:7  “Have you not seen a false vision,
and have you not spoken a divination of lies? You say, ‘ יהוה
declares,’ when I have not spoken.” 
Ezek
13:8  Therefore thus said the Master יהוה,
“Because you have spoken falsehood and seen lies, therefore see, I am against
you,” declares the Master יהוה. 
Ezek
13:9  “My hand shall be against the prophets
who see falsehood and who divine lies. They shall not be in the council of My
people, nor be written in the record of the house of Yisra’ĕl, and they
shall not enter into the land of Yisra’ĕl. And you shall know that I am
the Master יהוה. 
Ezek
13:10  “Because, yea because they have
led My people astray, saying, ‘Peace!’ when there is no peace. And when one is
building a wall, see, they are coating it with whitewash! 
Ezek
13:11  “Say to those who coat it with
whitewash: it shall fall! There shall be flooding rain, and you, O great
hailstones: fall! – and a stormy wind breaks it down, 
Ezek
13:12  and see, the wall shall fall!
Shall you not be asked, ‘Where is the coating with which you coated it?’ ” 
Ezek
13:13  Therefore thus said the Master יהוה,
“I shall break down with a stormy wind in My wrath, and a flooding rain in My
displeasure, and great hailstones in wrath, to consume. 
Ezek
13:14  “And I shall throw down the wall
you have coated with whitewash, and bring it down to the ground, and its
foundation shall be uncovered. And it shall fall, and you shall be consumed in
the midst of it. And you shall know that I am יהוה. 
Ezek
13:15  “So I shall complete My wrath on
the wall and on those coating it with whitewash, and say to you, ‘The wall is
no more, nor those whitewashing it – 
Ezek
13:16  the prophets of Yisra’ĕl who
are prophesying concerning Yerushalayim, and who are seeing visions of peace
for her when there is no peace,’ ” declares the Master יהוה.

Ezek
13:17  “And you, son of man, set your
face against the daughters of your people, who are prophesying out of their own
heart, and prophesy against them. 
Ezek
13:18  “And you shall say, ‘This is what
the Master יהוה said, “Woe to the women sewing cushions
for all joints of the hand, and to those making veils for the heads of people of every size, to hunt beings!
You hunt the beings of My people, while you keep alive your own beings! 
Ezek
13:19  “And you have profaned Me among My
people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to put to death beings
that should not die, and to keep alive beings who should not live, by your
lying to My people who listen to lies!” 
Ezek
13:20  ‘Therefore thus said the Master יהוה,
“See, I am against your cushions by which you hunt the beings there like birds.
And I shall tear them from your arms, and shall let the beings go, the beings
you hunt like birds. 
Ezek
13:21  “And I shall tear off your veils,
and shall deliver My people out of your hand, and they shall no longer be as
prey in your hand. And you shall know that I am YWHY.” ’ ” 
Ezek
13:22  “Because with falsehood you have
made the heart of the righteous sad, whom I have not made sad. And you have
strengthened the hands of the wrong, so that he does not turn from his evil
way, to keep him alive. 
Ezek
13:23  “Therefore you shall no longer see
false visions, nor practise divination. And I shall deliver My people out of
your hand, and you shall know that I am יהוה.” ’ ” 
Ezek
14:1  And some of the elders of Yisra’ĕl
came to me and sat before me. 
Ezek
14:2  And the word of יהוה
came to me, saying, 
Ezek
14:3  “Son of man, these men have set up
their idols in their hearts, and have put the stumbling-block of their
crookedness before their face. Should I let them inquire of Me at all? 
Ezek
14:4  “Therefore speak to them, and you
shall say to them, ‘Thus said the Master יהוה, “Everyone
of the house of Yisra’ĕl who sets up his idols in his heart, and puts the
stumbling-block of his crookedness before his face, and shall come to the
prophet – I יהוה shall answer him who comes, according
to his many idols, 
Ezek
14:5  in order to lay hold of the house
of Yisra’ĕl by their heart, for they have become estranged from Me by
their idols, all of them.” ’ 
Ezek
14:6  “Therefore say to the house of
Yisra’ĕl, ‘Thus said the Master יהוה, “Repent, and
turn back from your idols, and turn back your faces from all your abominations.

Ezek
14:7  “For anyone of the house of Yisra’ĕl,
or of the strangers who sojourn in Yisra’ĕl, who separates himself from Me
and sets up his idols in his heart and puts the stumbling-block of his
crookedness before his face, and shall come to a prophet to inquire of him
concerning Me, I יהוה shall answer him Myself. 
Ezek
14:8  “And I shall set My face against
that man and make him a sign and a proverb, and I shall cut him off from the
midst of My people. And you shall know that I am יהוה. 
Ezek
14:9  “And if the prophet is deceived,
and shall speak a word, I יהוה have deceived that
prophet, and shall stretch out My hand against him and destroy him from the
midst of My people Yisra’ĕl. 
Ezek
14:10  “And they shall bear their
crookedness, the crookedness of the prophet is the same as the crookedness of
the inquirer, 
Ezek
14:11  so that the house of Yisra’ĕl
no longer strays from Me, nor be made unclean any more with all their
transgressions. And they shall be My people and I be their Elohim,” declares
the Master יהוה.’ ” 
Ezek
14:12  And the word of יהוה
came again to me, saying, 
Ezek
14:13  “Son of man, when a land sins
against Me to commit a trespass, and I shall stretch out My hand against it,
and cut off its supply of bread and send scarcity of food on it, and cut off
man and beast from it, 
Ezek
14:14  even though these three men,
Noaḥ, Dani’ĕl, and Iyoḇ, were in it, they would deliver only
themselves by their righteousness,” declares the Master יהוה.

Ezek
14:15  “If I cause an evil beast to pass
through the land, and it shall bereave it, and it shall be a wasteland, so that
no man passes through because of the beasts, 
Ezek
14:16  even though these three men were
in it, as I live,” declares the Master יהוה, “they
would deliver neither sons nor daughters. They alone would be delivered, but
the land be a wasteland. 
Ezek
14:17  “Or if I bring a sword on that
land, and I shall say, ‘Sword, go through the land,’ and I shall cut off man
and beast from it, 
Ezek
14:18  even though these three men were
in its midst, as I live,” declares the Master יהוה, “they
would deliver neither sons nor daughters, for they alone would be delivered. 
Ezek
14:19  “Or if I send a pestilence into
that land, and I shall pour out My wrath on it in blood, to cut off from it man
and beast, 
Ezek
14:20  even though Noaḥ, Dani’ĕl,
and Iyoḇ were in it, as I live,” declares the Master יהוה,
“they would deliver neither son nor daughter. They would deliver their own
lives by their righteousness.” 
Ezek
14:21  For thus said the Master יהוה,
“How much more it shall be when I send My four evil judgments on Yerushalayim:
the sword and scarcity of food and evil beasts and pestilence, to cut off man
and beast from it? 
Ezek
14:22  “But see, there shall be left in
it a remnant who are brought out, both sons and daughters. See, they are coming
out to you, and you shall see their ways and their deeds, and shall be
comforted concerning the evil which I have brought upon Yerushalayim – all that
I have brought upon it. 
Ezek
14:23  “And they shall comfort you, when
you see their ways and their deeds. And you shall know that it was not for
naught that I have done whatever I did in it,” declares the Master יהוה.

Ezek
15:1  Then the word of יהוה
came to me, saying, 
Ezek
15:2  “Son of man, how is the vine tree
better than any tree, the vine branch that has been among the trees of the
forest? 
Ezek
15:3  “Is wood taken from it to be made
into any work? Do they take a peg from it to hang any vessel on? 
Ezek
15:4  “See, into the fire it shall be
given for fuel. Both ends of it the fire shall burn, and its middle shall be
scorched. Is it fit for any work? 
Ezek
15:5  “See, when it was intact, it was
not made for work, how much less when the fire has burned it and it is scorched
shall it still be used for work? 
Ezek
15:6  “Therefore thus said the Master יהוה,
‘As the vine tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire
for fuel, so I shall give up the inhabitants of Yerushalayim. 
Ezek
15:7  ‘And I shall set My face against
them. They shall go out from one fire, but another fire consumes them. And you
shall know that I am יהוה, when I set My face against
them. 
Ezek
15:8  ‘And I shall make the land a
wasteland, because they committed trespass,’ declares the Master יהוה.”

Ezek
16:1  Again the word of יהוה
came to me, saying, 
Ezek
16:2  “Son of man, make known to
Yerushalayim her abominations, 
Ezek
16:3  and say, ‘Thus said the Master יהוה
to Yerushalayim, “Your origin and your birth are from the land of Kena‛an.
Your father was an Amorite and your mother a Ḥittite. 
Ezek
16:4  “As for your birth, on the day you
were born your navel cord was not cut, nor were you washed in water for
cleansing, and you were not rubbed with salt at all, nor wrapped in cloth at
all. 
Ezek
16:5  “No eye felt sorry for you, to do
any of these for you, to have compassion on you. But you were thrown out into
the open field, to the loathing of your life on the day you were born. 
Ezek
16:6  “Then I passed by you and saw you
trampled down in your own blood, and I said to you in your blood, ‘Live!’ And I
said to you in your blood, ‘Live!’ 
Ezek
16:7  “I have let you grow like a plant
in the field. And you are grown and are great, and you come in the finest
ornaments. – breasts were formed, your hair grew, and you were naked and bare. 
Ezek
16:8  “Again I passed by you and looked
upon you and saw that your time was the time of love. And I spread My skirt
over you and covered your nakedness. And I swore an oath to you and entered
into a covenant with you, and you became Mine,” declares the Master יהוה.

Ezek
16:9  “And I washed you in water, and I
washed off your blood, and I anointed you with oil. 
Ezek
16:10  “And I dressed you in embroidered
work and gave you sandals of leather. And I wrapped you in fine linen and
covered you with silk. 
Ezek
16:11  “And I adorned you with ornaments,
and I put bracelets on your wrists, and a chain on your neck. 
Ezek
16:12  “And I put a ring on your nose,
and earrings in your ears, and a crown of adorning on your head. 
Ezek
16:13  “Thus you were adorned with gold
and silver, and your dress was of fine linen, and silk, and embroidered cloth.
You ate fine flour, and honey, and oil. And you were exceedingly pretty, and
became fit for royalty. 
Ezek
16:14  “And your name went out among the
nations because of your loveliness, for it was perfect, by My splendour which I
had put on you,” declares the Master יהוה. 
Ezek
16:15  “But you trusted in your own
loveliness, and whored because of your name, and poured out your whorings on
everyone passing by who would have it. 
Ezek
16:16  “And you took some of your
garments and made multi-coloured high places for yourself, and whored on them –
which should not have come about, nor shall it be. 
Ezek
16:17  “And you took your splendid
adornments, of My gold and My silver that I gave you, and made for yourself
images of a male and whored with them. 
Ezek
16:18  “And you took your embroidered
garments and covered them, and you set My oil and My incense before them. 
Ezek
16:19  “And My food which I gave you,
fine flour and oil and honey which I fed you, you set it before them as sweet
incense – and so it was,” declares the Master יהוה. 
Ezek
16:20  “And you took your sons and your
daughters, whom you bore to Me, and these you slaughtered as food to them. Were
your whorings a small matter, 
Ezek
16:21  that you have slain My children
and gave them up to them by causing them to pass through the fire? 
Ezek
16:22  “And in all your abominations and
whorings you did not remember the days of your youth, when you were naked and
bare, trampled down in your blood. 
Ezek
16:23  “Then it came to be after all your
evil – ‘Woe, woe to you!’ declares the Master יהוה – 
Ezek
16:24  that you also built an arched
place for yourself, and made a high place in every street for yourself. 
Ezek
16:25  “You built your high places at the
head of every way, and made your loveliness to be loathed. And you parted your
feet to everyone who passed by, and increased your whorings. 
Ezek
16:26  “And you whored with the sons of
Mitsrayim, your neighbours, great of flesh. And you increased your whorings to
provoke Me. 
Ezek
16:27  “And see, I have stretched out My
hand against you, and withdrew your portion, and gave you up to the desire of
those who hate you, the daughters of the Philistines, who are ashamed of your
wicked way. 
Ezek
16:28  “And you whored with the sons of
Ashshur, without being satisfied. And you whored with them and still were not
satisfied.
Ezek
16:29  “And you increased your whorings
as far as the land of traders, Chaldea, and even then you were not satisfied. 
Ezek
16:30  “How weak is your heart!” declares
the Master יהוה, “seeing you do all this, the deeds of
a shameless whore. 
Ezek
16:31  “You built your arched place at
the head of every way, and built your high place in every street. Yet you were
unlike a whore, you scorned payment! 
Ezek
16:32  “The wife who commits adultery who
takes strangers instead of her husband! 
Ezek
16:33  “To all whores they give gifts,
but you gave gifts to all your lovers, and bribed them to come to you from all
around in your whorings. 
Ezek
16:34  “Thus you are different from other
women in your whorings, because no one whores after you, and in you giving a
gift, while a gift was not given to you. Thus you are different.” 
Ezek
16:35  ‘Therefore, O whore, hear the word
of יהוה ! 
Ezek
16:36  ‘Thus said the Master יהוה,
“Because your copper was poured out and your nakedness uncovered in your
whorings with your lovers, and with the idols of your abominations, and because
of the blood of your children which you gave to them, 
Ezek
16:37  therefore, see, I am gathering all
your lovers with whom you took pleasure, all those you loved, with all those
you hated. And I shall gather them from all around against you and shall
uncover your nakedness to them, and they shall see all your nakedness. 
Ezek
16:38  “And I shall judge you with
judgments of adulteresses and shedders of blood. And I shall bring on you the
blood of wrath and jealousy. 
Ezek
16:39  “And I shall give you into their
hand, and they shall throw your arched place down, and they shall break down
your high places. And they shall strip you of your garments, and they shall
take your splendid adornments, and leave you naked and bare. 
Ezek
16:40  “And they shall bring up an
assembly against you, and they shall stone you with stones and thrust you
through with their swords, 
Ezek
16:41  and burn your houses with fire,
and execute judgments on you before the eyes of many women. And I shall make
you stop whoring, and no longer give gifts. 
Ezek
16:42  “So I shall bring My wrath to rest
upon you, and My jealousy shall turn away from you. And I shall be calm, and no
longer be vexed. 
Ezek
16:43  “Because you did not remember the
days of your youth, but troubled Me with all this, so see, I shall also bring
your way on your own head,” declares the Master יהוה. “And
shall I not do this thought for all your abominations? 
Ezek
16:44  “See, all who use proverbs shall
use this proverb against you, ‘Like mother, like daughter!’ 
Ezek
16:45  “You are your mother’s daughter,
who despises her husband and her children. And you are the sister of your
sisters, who despised their husbands and their children. Your mother was a Ḥittite
and your father an Amorite. 
Ezek
16:46  “And your elder sister is
Shomeron, she and her daughters, who is dwelling to the north of you. And your
younger sister, who is dwelling to the south of you, is Seḏom and her
daughters. 
Ezek
16:47  “And have you not walked in their
ways and did according to their abominations? But in all your ways you soon
became more corrupt than they. 
Ezek
16:48  “As I live,” declares the Master יהוה,
“neither your sister Seḏom nor her daughters have done as you and your
daughters have done. 
Ezek
16:49  “See, this was the crookedness of
your sister Seḏom: She and her daughter had pride, sufficiency of bread,
and unconcerned ease. And she did not help the poor and needy. 
Ezek
16:50  “And they were haughty and did
abomination before Me, and I took them away when I saw it. 
Ezek
16:51  “And Shomeron did not commit half
of your sins, but you have increased your abominations more than they, and by
all the abominations which you have done you made your sisters seem righteous! 
Ezek
16:52  “You also, who pleaded for your
sisters, bear your own shame, because the sins which you committed were more
abominable than theirs. They are more righteous than you. So be ashamed too,
and bear your own shame, because you have made your sisters seem righteous. 
Ezek
16:53  “And I shall turn back their
captivity, the captivity of Seḏom and her daughters, and the captivity of
Shomeron and her daughters, and the captivity of your captives with them, 
Ezek
16:54  so that you bear your shame, and
shall blush for all that you did when you comforted them, 
Ezek
16:55  “and your sisters, Seḏom and
her daughters, return to their former state, and Shomeron and her daughters
return to their former state, and you and your daughters return to your former
state. 
Ezek
16:56  “Was not your sister Seḏom a
byword in your mouth in the days of your pride, 
Ezek
16:57  before your evil was exposed, as
the time of the reproach of the daughters of Aram and all who were around her,
and of the daughters of the Philistines, who are despising you everywhere? 
Ezek
16:58  “You shall bear your wickedness
and your abominations,” declares יהוה. 
Ezek
16:59  ‘For thus said the Master יהוה,
“I shall deal with you as you have done, in that you have despised the oath by
breaking the covenant. 
Ezek
16:60  “But I shall remember My covenant
with you in the days of your youth, and I shall establish an everlasting
covenant with you. 
Ezek
16:61  “And you shall remember your ways
and be ashamed, when you receive your older and your younger sisters. And I
shall give them to you for daughters, though not by your own covenant. 
Ezek
16:62  “And I Myself shall establish My
covenant with you. And you shall know that I am יהוה, 
Ezek
16:63  so that you remember. And you
shall be ashamed, and never open your mouth any more because of your shame,
when I pardon you for all you have done,” declares the Master יהוה.’
” 
Ezek
17:1  And the word of יהוה
came to me, saying, 
Ezek
17:2  “Son of man, put forth a riddle,
and speak a parable to the house of Yisra’ĕl. 
Ezek
17:3  “And you shall say, ‘Thus said the
Master יהוה, “The great eagle with large wings of long
pinions, covered with feathers of various colours, came to Leḇanon and
took the top of the cedar. 
Ezek
17:4  “He plucked off the topmost of its
young twigs and brought it to a land of traders. In a city of merchants he
placed it. 
Ezek
17:5  “He also took some of the seed of
the land and planted it in a field for seed. He took it by many waters, set it
like a willow tree. 
Ezek
17:6  “So it grew and became a low,
spreading vine. Its branches turned toward him, and its roots were under it.
And it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and sent out shoots. 
Ezek
17:7  “And there was another great eagle
with large wings and many feathers. And see, this vine bent its roots toward
him, and stretched its branches toward him, to water it, away from the beds
where it was planted. 
Ezek
17:8  “It was planted in a good field by
many waters, to bring forth branches, and to bear fruit, to be a splendid vine.”
’ 
Ezek
17:9  “Say, ‘Thus said the Master יהוה,
“Is it going to thrive? Is he not going to pull up its roots, and cut off its
fruit, and let it wither? All of its sprouting leaves wither, without great
power or many people, to pluck it up by its roots.
Ezek
17:10  “See, it is planted, is it going
to thrive? Would it not utterly wither when the east wind touches it – wither
in the beds where it grows?” ’ ” 
Ezek
17:11  And the word of יהוה
came to me, saying, 
Ezek
17:12  “Please say to the rebellious
house, ‘Do you not know what these mean?’ Say, ‘See, the sovereign of Baḇel
went to Yerushalayim and took its sovereign and heads, and brought them with
him to Baḇel. 
Ezek
17:13  ‘And he took one of the royal
seed, and made a covenant with him, and put him under oath. And he took away
the mighty of the land, 
Ezek
17:14  so that the reign would be brought
low and not lift itself up, but guard his covenant, that it might stand. 
Ezek
17:15  ‘But he rebelled against him by
sending his messengers to Mitsrayim, to give him horses and many people. Shall
he thrive? Shall he escape who is doing these? And shall he break a covenant
and still escape? 
Ezek
17:16  ‘As I live,’ declares the Master יהוה,
‘in the place where the sovereign dwells who set him up to reign, whose oath he
despised and whose covenant he broke, with him in the midst of Baḇel he
shall die! 
Ezek
17:17  ‘And Pharaoh with his great army
and great company is not going to help him in battle, when they heap up a siege
mound and build a wall to cut off many beings. 
Ezek
17:18  ‘And he despised the oath by
breaking the covenant. And see, he has given his hand and he has done all this,
he is not going to escape.’ ” 
Ezek
17:19  Therefore thus said the Master יהוה,
“As I live, My oath which he has despised, and My covenant which he has broken,
shall I not put it on his own head? 
Ezek
17:20  “And I shall spread My net over
him, and he shall be taken in My snare. And I shall bring him to Baḇel
and enter into judgment with him there for the trespass which he committed
against Me, 
Ezek
17:21  and all his fugitives with all his
bands fall by the sword, and those who are left be scattered to every wind. And
you shall know that I, יהוה, have spoken.” 
Ezek
17:22  Thus said the Master יהוה,
“And I shall take of the top of the highest cedar and set it out. And I Myself
shall pluck off a tender one from the topmost of its young twigs, and plant it
on a high and lofty mountain. 
Ezek
17:23  “On the mountain height of Yisra’ĕl
I plant it. And it shall bring forth branches, and bear fruit, and become a big
cedar. And under it shall dwell birds of every sort, in the shadow of its branches
they shall dwell. 
Ezek
17:24  “And all the trees of the field
shall know that I, יהוה, have brought down the high
tree and exalted the low tree, dried up the green tree and made the dry tree
flourish. I, יהוה, have spoken and shall do it.” 
Ezek
18:1  And the word of יהוה
came to me, saying, 
Ezek
18:2  “What do you mean when you use this
proverb concerning the land of Yisra’ĕl, saying, ‘The fathers have eaten
sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are blunted’? 
Ezek
18:3  “As I live,” declares the Master יהוה,
“you shall no longer use this proverb in Yisra’ĕl. 
Ezek
18:4  “See, all beings are Mine, the
being of the father as well as the being of the son is Mine. The being that is
sinning shall die. 
Ezek
18:5  “But if a man is righteous and
shall do right-ruling and righteousness, 
Ezek
18:6  if he has not eaten on the
mountains, nor lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Yisra’ĕl,
nor defiled his neighbour’s wife, nor comes near a woman during her
uncleanness, 
Ezek
18:7  if he does not oppress anyone, does
return to the debtor his pledge, does not commit robbery, does give his bread
to the hungry and covers the naked with a garment, 
Ezek
18:8  if he does not lend on interest or
take increase, turns back his hand from unrighteousness, executes right-ruling
in truth between man and man, 
Ezek
18:9  if he walks in My laws, and he has
guarded My right-rulings in truth – he is righteous, he shall certainly live!”
declares the Master יהוה. 
Ezek
18:10  “But if he has brought forth a son
who is a robber or a shedder of blood, who does any of these – 
Ezek
18:11  whereas he himself did not do any
of these – that also he has eaten on the mountains or defiled his neighbour’s
wife, 
Ezek
18:12  if he has oppressed the poor and
needy, has committed robbery, he does not return a pledge, has lifted his eyes
to the idols, or did abomination, 
Ezek
18:13  if he has lent on interest or
taken increase – shall he live? He shall not live! If he has done any of these
abominations, he shall certainly die, his blood is upon him. 
Ezek
18:14  “But see, if he has brought forth
a son who sees all the sins which his father has done, but he fears and does
not do likewise, 
Ezek
18:15  has not eaten on the mountains,
and has not lifted his eyes to the idols of the house of Yisra’ĕl, has not
defiled his neighbour’s wife, 
Ezek
18:16  has not oppressed anyone, nor
withheld a pledge, nor committed robbery, has given his bread to the hungry and
covered the naked with a garment, 
Ezek
18:17  turns back his hand from wronging the poor, and he has not taken
interest or increase, has executed My right-rulings and walked in My laws – he
shall not die for the crookedness of his father, he shall certainly live! 
Ezek
18:18  “His father, because he used
oppression, robbed his brother, and did what is not good among his people, see,
he shall die for his crookedness. 
Ezek
18:19  “And you said, ‘Why should the son
not bear the crookedness of the father?’ But the son has done right-ruling and
righteousness, he has guarded all My laws and he does them, he shall certainly
live. 
Ezek
18:20  “The being who sins shall die. The
son shall not bear the crookedness of the father, nor the father bear the
crookedness of the son. The righteousness of the righteous is upon himself, and
the wrongness of the wrong is upon himself. 
Ezek
18:21  “But the wrong, if he turns from
all his sins which he has done, and he shall guard all My laws, and shall do
right-ruling and righteousness, he shall certainly live, he shall not die.
Ezek
18:22  “All the transgressions which he
has done shall not be remembered against him – in his righteousness that he has
done, he shall live. 
Ezek
18:23  “Have I any pleasure in the death
of the wrong?” declares the Master יהוה. “Is it not
that he should turn from his ways, and live? 
Ezek
18:24  “But when a righteous one turns
away from his righteousness and does unrighteousness, according to all the
abominations that the wrong one has done, shall he live? All his righteousness
which he has done shall not be remembered. For his trespass which he has
committed, and for his sin which he has committed, for them he shall die. 
Ezek
18:25  “And you said, ‘The way of יהוה
is not right.’ Hear now, O house of Yisra’ĕl, is My way not right? Is it
not your ways that are not right? 
Ezek
18:26  “When a righteous one turns away
from his righteousness, and does unrighteousness, and he dies in it, it is
because of his unrighteousness which he has done that he dies. 
Ezek
18:27  “And when the wrong turns away
from the wrong which he has done, and he does right-ruling and righteousness,
he keeps himself alive. 
Ezek
18:28  “Because he sees and turns away
from all the transgressions which he has done, he shall certainly live, he
shall not die. 
Ezek
18:29  “And the house of Yisra’ĕl
have said, ‘The way of יהוה is not right.’ Are My ways
not right, O house of Yisra’ĕl? Is it not your ways that are not right? 
Ezek
18:30  “Therefore I judge you, O house of
Yisra’ĕl, every one according to his ways,” declares the Master יהוה.
“Repent, and turn back from all your transgressions, and let not crookedness be
a stumbling-block to you. 
Ezek
18:31  “Cast away from you all the
transgressions, by which you have transgressed, and make for yourselves a new
heart and a new spirit. For why should you die, O house of Yisra’ĕl? 
Ezek
18:32  “For I have no pleasure in the
death of one who dies,” declares the Master יהוה. “So
turn back and live!” 
Ezek
19:1  “And take up a lamentation for the
leaders of Yisra’ĕl, 
Ezek
19:2  and you shall say, ‘What a lioness
was your mother among the lions! She lay down among the lions, in the midst of
the young lions she reared her cubs. 
Ezek
19:3  ‘And she brought up one of her
cubs, and he became a young lion. And he learned to tear the prey, he devoured
men. 
Ezek
19:4  ‘Then nations heard of him. He was
caught in their pit, and they brought him with chains to the land of Mitsrayim.

Ezek
19:5  ‘When she saw, as she waited, that
her expectancy was lost, she took another of her cubs and made him a young
lion. 
Ezek
19:6  ‘And he went about among the lions,
and became a young lion. And he learned to tear the prey, he devoured men. 
Ezek
19:7  ‘And he knew their widows, and laid
waste their cities. And the land and all who filled it was stunned by the noise
of his roaring. 
Ezek
19:8  ‘Then nations set against him from
the provinces on every side, and spread their net over him, he was caught in
their pit. 
Ezek
19:9  ‘And they put him in a cage in
chains, and brought him to the sovereign of Baḇel. They brought him in
nets, so his roar was no longer heard on the mountains of Yisra’ĕl. 
Ezek
19:10  ‘Your mother was like a vine in
your vineyard, planted by the waters, a bearer of fruit and branching, because
of many waters. 
Ezek
19:11  ‘And she had strong rods for
sceptres of rulers. And her stature was exalted among the thick branches, and
was seen in her height with the mass of its branches. 
Ezek
19:12  ‘But she was uprooted in wrath,
she was cast down to the ground, and the east wind dried her fruit. Her strong
rods were broken and withered, fire consumed them. 
Ezek
19:13  ‘And now she is planted in the
wilderness, in a dry and thirsty land. 
Ezek
19:14  ‘And fire went out from a rod of
her branches. It devoured her fruit, so that she has no strong rod, a sceptre
to rule.’ ” This is a lament, and it shall be a lament.
Ezek
20:1  And it came to be in the seventh
year, in the fifth month, on the tenth of the month, that certain of the elders
of Yisra’ĕl came to inquire of יהוה, and sat
before me. 
Ezek
20:2  And the word of יהוה
came to me, saying, 
Ezek
20:3  “Son of man, speak to the elders of
Yisra’ĕl, and say to them, ‘Thus said the Master יהוה,
“Have you come to inquire of Me? As I live, I am not being inquired of by you,”
declares the Master יהוה.’ 
Ezek
20:4  “Judge them, son of man, judge
them! Make known to them the abominations of their fathers. 
Ezek
20:5  “And you shall say to them, ‘Thus
said the Master יהוה, “On the day when I chose Yisra’ĕl
and lifted My hand in an oath to the seed of the house of Ya‛aqoḇ,
and made Myself known to them in the land of Mitsrayim, I lifted My hand in an
oath to them, saying, ‘I am יהוה your Elohim.’ 
Ezek
20:6  “On that day I lifted My hand in an
oath to them, to bring them out of the land of Mitsrayim into a land that I had
searched out for them, flowing with milk and honey, the splendour of all lands.

Ezek
20:7  “And I said to them, ‘Each one of
you, throw away the abominations which are before his eyes, and do not defile
yourselves with the idols of Mitsrayim! I am יהוה your
Elohim.’ 
Ezek
20:8  “But they rebelled against Me, and
would not obey Me. All of them did not throw away the abominations which were
before their eyes, nor did they forsake the idols of Mitsrayim. So I resolved
to pour out My wrath on them to complete My displeasure against them in the
midst of the land of Mitsrayim. 
Ezek
20:9  “But I acted for My Name’s sake,
that it should not be profaned before the eyes of the gentiles among whom they
were – before whose eyes I had made Myself known to them, to bring them out of
the land of Mitsrayim. 
Ezek
20:10  “So I took them out of the land of
Mitsrayim, and I brought them into the wilderness. 
Ezek
20:11  “And I gave them My laws and
showed them My right-rulings, ‘which, if a man does, he shall live by them.’ 
Ezek
20:12  “And I also gave them My Sabbaths,
to be a sign between them and Me, to know that I am יהוה
who sets them apart.
Ezek
20:13  “But the house of Yisra’ĕl
rebelled against Me in the wilderness. They did not walk in My laws, and they
rejected My right-rulings, which, if a man does, he shall live by them. And
they greatly profaned My Sabbaths. Then I said I would pour out My wrath on
them in the wilderness, to consume them. 
Ezek
20:14  “But I acted for My Name’s sake,
not to profane it before the gentiles, before whose eyes I had brought them
out. 
Ezek
20:15  “And I Myself also lifted My hand
in an oath to them in the wilderness, not to bring them into the land which I
had given them, flowing with milk and honey, the splendour of all lands, 
Ezek
20:16  because they rejected My
right-rulings and did not walk in My laws, and they profaned My Sabbaths. For
their heart went after their idols. 
Ezek
20:17  “And My eye pardoned them, from
destroying them. And I did not make an end of them in the wilderness. 
Ezek
20:18  “And I said to their children in
the wilderness, ‘Do not walk in the laws of your fathers, nor observe their
rulings, nor defile yourselves with their idols. 
Ezek
20:19  ‘I am יהוה
your Elohim. Walk in My laws, and guard My right-rulings, and do them.

they shall be a sign between Me and you, to know that I am יהוה
your Elohim.’ 
Ezek

Me. They did not walk in My laws, and My right-rulings they did not guard to do
them, which, if a man does, he shall live by them. They profaned My Sabbaths,
so I resolved to pour out My wrath on them to complete My displeasure against
them in the wilderness. 
Ezek
20:22  “But I held back My hand and acted
for My Name’s sake, not to profane it before the eyes of the gentiles, before
whose eyes I had brought them out. 
Ezek
20:23  “Also, I Myself lifted My hand in
an oath to those in the wilderness, to scatter them among the gentiles and
disperse them throughout the lands, 
Ezek
20:24  because they had not done My
right-rulings, and they rejected My laws, and they profaned My Sabbaths, and
their eyes were on their fathers’ idols. 
Ezek
20:25  “And I also gave them up to laws
that were not good, and right-rulings by which they would not live.
Ezek
20:26  “And I defiled them by their own
gifts, as they passed all their first-born through the fire, so that I might stun them, so that they know that I am יהוה.”

Ezek
20:27  “Therefore, son of man, speak to
the house of Yisra’ĕl, and you shall say to them, ‘Thus said the Master יהוה,
“In this your fathers have further reviled Me, by committing trespass against
Me. 
Ezek
20:28  “When I brought them into the land
for which I had lifted My hand in an oath to give them, and they saw all the
high hills and all the thick trees, they offered their slaughterings there and
provoked Me with their offerings there. And they sent up their sweet fragrance
there and poured out their drink offerings there. 
Ezek
20:29  “And I said to them, ‘What is this
high place to which you go?’ So its name is called High Place to this day.” ’ 
Ezek
20:30  “Therefore say to the house of
Yisra’ĕl, ‘Thus said the Master יהוה, “Are you
defiling yourselves in the way of your fathers? And do you whore after their
abominations? 
Ezek
20:31  “For when you lift up your gifts
and make your sons pass through the fire, you defile yourselves with all your
idols, even to this day. And shall I be inquired of by you, O house of Yisra’ĕl?
As I live,” declares the Master יהוה, “I am not being
inquired of by you. 
Ezek
20:32  “And what comes up in your spirit
shall never be, when you say, ‘Let us be like the gentiles, like the tribes in
other lands, serving wood and stone.’ 
Ezek
20:33  “As I live,” declares the Master יהוה,
“do not I, with a mighty hand, with an outstretched arm, and with wrath poured
out, reign over you? 
Ezek
20:34  “And I shall bring you out from
the peoples and gather you out of the lands where you are scattered, with a
mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with wrath poured out. 
Ezek
20:35  “And I shall bring you into the
wilderness of the peoples, and shall enter into judgment with you face to face
there. 
Ezek
20:36  “As I entered into judgment with
your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Mitsrayim, so I shall enter into
judgment with you,” declares the Master יהוה. 
Ezek
20:37  “And I shall make you pass under
the rod, and shall bring you into the bond of the covenant, 
Ezek
20:38  and purge the rebels from among
you, and those who transgress against Me. From the land where they sojourn I
bring them out, but they shall not come into the land of Yisra’ĕl. And you
shall know that I am יהוה. 
Ezek
20:39  “As for you, O house of Yisra’ĕl,”
thus said the Master יהוה, “Go, serve each of you his
idols, and afterwards, if you are not listening to Me. But do not profane My
set-apart Name any more with your gifts and your idols. 
Ezek
20:40  “For on My set-apart mountain, on
the mountain height of Yisra’ĕl,” declares the Master יהוה,
“there all the house of Yisra’ĕl, all of them in the land, shall serve Me.
There I shall accept them, and there I shall require your offerings and the
first-fruits of your offerings, together with all your set-apart gifts. 
Ezek
20:41  “As a sweet fragrance I shall
accept you when I bring you out from the peoples. And I shall gather you out of
the lands where you have been scattered. And I shall be set-apart in you before
the gentiles. 
Ezek
20:42  “And you shall know that I am יהוה,

lifted My hand in an oath to give to your fathers. 
Ezek
20:43  “And there you shall remember your
ways and all your deeds with which you were defiled. And you shall loathe yourselves
in your own sight because of all the evils that you did. 
Ezek
20:44  “And you shall know that I am יהוה,
when I have dealt with you for My Name’s sake, not according to your evil ways
nor according to your corrupt deeds, O house of Yisra’ĕl,” declares the
Master יהוה.’ ” 
Ezek
20:45  And the word of יהוה
came to me, saying, 
Ezek
20:46  “Son of man, set your face toward
the south, and drop word against the
south and prophesy against the forest land, the South. 
Ezek
20:47  “And you shall say to the forest
of the South, ‘Hear the word of יהוה ! Thus said the
Master יהוה, “See, I am kindling a fire in you, and it
shall devour every green tree and every dry tree in you – the blazing flame is
not quenched. And it shall burn all faces from the south to the north. 
Ezek
20:48  “And all flesh shall see that I, יהוה,
have kindled it, it is not quenched.” ’ ” 
Ezek
20:49  And I said, “Ah, Master יהוה
! They are saying of me, ‘Is he not speaking parables?’ ” 
Ezek
21:1  And the word of יהוה
came to me, saying, 
Ezek
21:2  “Son of man, set your face toward
Yerushalayim, and drop word against
the set-apart places, and prophesy against the land of Yisra’ĕl. 
Ezek
21:3  “And you shall say to the land of
Yisra’ĕl, ‘Thus said יהוה, “See, I am against you,
and I shall draw My sword out of its sheath and cut off from you the righteous
and the wrong. 
Ezek
21:4  “Because I shall cut off from you
the righteous and the wrong, therefore My sword shall go out of its sheath
against all flesh from south to north. 
Ezek
21:5  “And all flesh shall know that I, יהוה,
have drawn My sword out of its sheath, not to turn back again.” ’ 
Ezek
21:6  “And you, son of man, sigh with a
breaking of loins, and sigh with bitterness before their eyes. 
Ezek
21:7  “And it shall be when they say to
you, ‘Why are you sighing?’ that you shall say, ‘Because of the report that is
coming. And every heart shall melt, and all hands shall go limp, and every
spirit become faint, and all knees be weak as water. See, it is coming, and it
shall be,’ declares the Master יהוה.” 
Ezek
21:8  And the word of יהוה
came to me, saying, 
Ezek
21:9  “Son of man, prophesy, and you
shall say, ‘Thus said יהוה ! “Say, ‘A sword, a sword is
sharpened and also polished!
Ezek
21:10  ‘It is sharpened to make a
slaughter, it is polished to flash like lightning!’ Or shall we rejoice? My
son, you have despised the rod, every stick!
Ezek
21:11  “And He has given it to be
polished, to be taken by the hand. This sword is sharpened and polished, to be
given into the hand of the slayer. 
Ezek
21:12  “Cry and wail, son of man, for it
shall be on My people, on all the leaders of Yisra’ĕl. They shall be
delivered to the sword together with My people, therefore strike your thigh. 
Ezek
21:13  “For it is a trier, and what if it
even despises the rod? Shall it not be?” declares the Master יהוה.

Ezek
21:14  “And you, son of man, prophesy,
and strike your hands together. And let the sword come down twice, thrice, the
sword for the slain. It is the sword of the slain, the great one, which
surrounds them. 
Ezek
21:15  “I have set the point of the sword
against all their gates, to melt the heart and that the overthrown be many. Ah!
It is made like lightning, keen for slaughter. 
Ezek
21:16  “Sharpen yourself on the right,
set yourself on the left, wherever your edge is appointed! 
Ezek
21:17  “And I too, I shall strike My
hands together and cause My wrath to rest. I, יהוה,
have spoken.” 
Ezek
21:18  And the word of יהוה
came to me again, saying, 
Ezek
21:19  “And you, son of man, appoint for
yourself two ways for the sword of the sovereign of Baḇel to go, both of
them coming from one land. And place a signpost, put it at the head of the way
to the city. 
Ezek
21:20  “Appoint a way for the sword to go
to Rabbah of the Ammonites, and to Yehuḏah, into the walled Yerushalayim.
Ezek
21:21  “For the sovereign of Baḇel
shall stand at the parting of the way, at the fork of the two ways, to practise
divination. He shall shake the arrows, he shall ask the household idols, he
shall look at the liver. 
Ezek
21:22  “In his right hand shall be the
divination for Yerushalayim: to set up battering rams, to call for a slaughter,
to lift the voice with shouting, to set battering rams against the gates, to
heap up a siege mound, to build a wall. 
Ezek
21:23  “And it shall be to them as a
false divination in the eyes of those who have sworn oaths to them. But he is
bringing their crookedness to remembrance, so that they are taken. 
Ezek
21:24  “Therefore thus said the Master יהוה,
‘Because you have made your crookedness to be remembered, in that your
transgressions are uncovered, so that your sins are seen in all your deeds.
Because you have been remembered, you are taken by hand. 
Ezek
21:25  ‘And to you, O profane, wrong one,
leader of Yisra’ĕl, whose day has come, in the time of the crookedness of
the end, 
Ezek
21:26  thus said the Master יהוה,
‘Remove the turban, and take off the crown! This shall not remain! Exalt the
humble, and humble the exalted. 
Ezek
21:27  ‘Overthrown, overthrown, I make it
overthrown! It shall be no longer, until He comes to whom it rightly belongs –
and I shall give it!’ 
Ezek
21:28  “And you, son of man, prophesy and
say, ‘Thus said the Master יהוה concerning the
Ammonites and concerning their reproach.’ And you shall say, ‘A sword, a sword,
drawn for slaughter, polished to the utmost like lightning – 
Ezek
21:29  while they see false visions for
you, while they divine a lie to you – to put you on the necks of the profaned
ones, the wrong ones whose day has come, in the time of the crookedness of the
end. 
Ezek
21:30  ‘Return it to its sheath. In the
place where you were created, in the land of your origin, I shall judge you. 
Ezek
21:31  ‘And I shall pour out My
displeasure on you, blow against you with the fire of My wrath, and shall give
you into the hands of beastly men, skilled to destroy. 
Ezek
21:32  ‘You are to be fuel for the fire,
your blood to be in the midst of the land. You are not to be remembered, for I יהוה
have spoken.’ ” 
Ezek
22:1  And the word of יהוה
came to me, saying, 
Ezek
22:2  “And now, son of man, judge, judge
the city of blood! And you shall show her all her abominations! 
Ezek
22:3  “And you shall say, ‘Thus said the
Master יהוה, “The city sheds blood in her midst, that
her time might come. And she has made idols within herself to become defiled. 
Ezek
22:4  “You have become guilty by the
blood which you have shed, and have defiled yourself with the idols which you
have made. Thus you have brought your days near, and have come to the end of
your years. Therefore I shall make you a reproach to the gentiles, and a
mockery to all lands. 
Ezek
22:5  “Those near and those far from you
mock you – defiled is your name and great the confusion! 
Ezek
22:6  “See the leaders of Yisra’ĕl:
each one has used his arm to shed blood in you. 
Ezek
22:7  “They have despised father and
mother within you. They have oppressed the stranger in your midst. They have
wronged the fatherless and the widow within you.
Ezek
22:8  “You have despised that which is
set-apart to Me, and you have profaned My Sabbaths. 
Ezek
22:9  “Slanderous men have been in you to
shed blood. And in you are those who eat on the mountains. They have done
wickedness in your midst. 
Ezek
22:10  “In you they have uncovered the
nakedness of a father. In you they have humbled women who are defiled during
their uncleanness. 
Ezek
22:11  “And the one has done abomination
with his neighbour’s wife. And another has wickedly defiled his
daughter-in-law. And another within you has humbled his sister, his father’s
daughter. 
Ezek
22:12  “In you they have taken a bribe to
shed blood. You have taken interest and increase. You have cut off your
neighbour by extortion. And you have forgotten Me,” declares the Master יהוה.

Ezek
22:13  “And see, I shall smite My hand
because of your greedy gain which you have made, and at the bloodshed which has
been in your midst. 
Ezek
22:14  “Would your heart stand, your
hands remain strong, in the days when I deal with you? I, יהוה,
have spoken, and shall do it. 
Ezek
22:15  “And I shall scatter you among the
gentiles, and shall disperse you throughout the lands, and shall consume your
filthiness out of you. 
Ezek
22:16  “And you shall profane yourself
before the eyes of the gentiles. And you shall know that I am יהוה.”
’ ” 
Ezek
22:17  And the word of יהוה
came to me, saying, 
Ezek
22:18  “Son of man, the house of Yisra’ĕl
has become dross to Me. All of them are bronze, and tin, and iron, and lead, in
the midst of a furnace – they have become the dross of silver. 
Ezek
22:19  “Therefore thus said the Master יהוה,
‘Because all of you have become dross, therefore see, I am gathering you into
the midst of Yerushalayim. 
Ezek
22:20  ‘As they gather silver, and
bronze, and iron, and lead, and tin into the midst of a furnace, to blow fire
on it, to melt it, so I gather you in My displeasure and in My wrath. And I
shall blow and melt you. 
Ezek
22:21  ‘And I shall gather you and blow
on you with the fire of My wrath, and you shall be melted in its midst. 
Ezek
22:22  ‘As silver is melted in the midst
of a furnace, so are you melted in its midst. And you shall know that I, יהוה,
have poured out My wrath on you.’ ” 
Ezek
22:23  And the word of יהוה
came to me, saying, 
Ezek
22:24  “Son of man, say to her, ‘You are
a land that is not cleansed or rained upon in the day of displeasure.’ 
Ezek
22:25  “There is a conspiracy of her
prophets in her midst, like a roaring lion tearing the prey. They have devoured
life, they have taken wealth and precious matters,
they have made many widows in her midst. 
Ezek
22:26  “Her priests have done violence to
My teaching and they profane My set-apart matters.
They have not distinguished between the set-apart and profane, nor have they
made known the difference between the
unclean and the clean. And they have hidden their eyes from My Sabbaths, and I
am profaned in their midst.
Ezek
22:27  “Her leaders in her midst are like
wolves tearing the prey, to shed blood, to destroy lives, and to get greedy
gain. 
Ezek
22:28  “And her prophets have coated them
with whitewash, seeing a false vision, and divining a lie for them, saying, ‘Thus
said the Master יהוה,’ when יהוה
had not spoken. 
Ezek
22:29  “The people of the land have
practised oppression, and committed robbery, and have wronged the poor and
needy. And they oppressed the stranger without right-ruling. 
Ezek
22:30  “And I sought for a man among them
who would make a wall, and stand in the breach before Me on behalf of the land,
that I should not destroy it – but I did not find one! 
Ezek
22:31  “Therefore I have poured out My
displeasure on them, I have consumed them with the fire of My wrath. And I have
put their way on their own head,” declares the Master יהוה.

Ezek
23:1  And the word of יהוה
came to me, saying, 
Ezek
23:2  “Son of man, there were two women,
daughters of one mother. 
Ezek
23:3  “And they whored in Mitsrayim, they
whored in their youth. There their breasts were handled, and there their maiden
nipples were squeezed. 
Ezek
23:4  “And their names were: Oholah the elder
and Oholiḇah her sister. And they were Mine, and they bore sons and
daughters. And their names: Shomeron is Oholah, and Yerushalayim is Oholiḇah.

Ezek
23:5  “And Oholah whored while she was
Mine. And she lusted for her lovers, the neighbouring Ashshurians, 
Ezek
23:6  dressed in purple, officers and
rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding on horses. 
Ezek
23:7  “So she gave her whorings on them,
all of them choice sons of Ashshur. And with all for whom she lusted, with all
their idols, she defiled herself. 
Ezek
23:8  “And she did not forsake her
whorings from Mitsrayim, for in her youth they had lain with her, and they
squeezed her maiden nipples, and poured out their whorings on her. 
Ezek
23:9  “Therefore I have given her into
the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Ashshurians, for whom she lusted. 
Ezek
23:10  “They uncovered her nakedness,
they took away her sons and daughters, and slew her with the sword. And she
became a byword among women, and they executed judgments on her. 
Ezek
23:11  “And her sister Oholiḇah saw
this, yet she became more corrupt in her lust than she, and in her whorings
more corrupt than her sister’s whorings. 
Ezek
23:12  “She lusted for the sons of
Ashshur, officers and rulers, the ones near, perfectly dressed, horsemen riding
on horses, all of them desirable young men.
Ezek
23:13  “And I saw that she was defiled,
they both took the same way. 
Ezek
23:14  “But she increased her whorings,
and she looked at men carved on the wall, images of Chaldeans portrayed in red,

Ezek
23:15  girded with belts around their
loins, flowing turbans on their heads, all of them looking like officers, like
the Baḇelians of Chaldea, the land of their birth. 
Ezek
23:16  “As soon as her eyes saw them, she
lusted for them and sent messengers to them in Chaldea. 
Ezek
23:17  “And the Baḇelians came to
her, into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their whorings. And she
was defiled by them, and her being turned from them in disgust. 
Ezek
23:18  “And she uncovered her whorings
and uncovered her nakedness. Then I turned My being from her in disgust, as My
being had turned from her sister in disgust. 
Ezek
23:19  “And she increased her whorings,
remembering the days of her youth, when she whored in the land of Mitsrayim. 
Ezek
23:20  “And she lusted after her lovers,
whose flesh is like the flesh of donkeys, and whose emission is like the
emission of horses. 
Ezek
23:21  “Thus you longed for the
wickedness of your youth, when the Mitsrites squeezed your nipples because of the
breasts of your youth. 
Ezek
23:22  “Therefore, Oholiḇah, thus
said the Master יהוה, ‘See, I am stirring up your
lovers against you, from whom your being turned in disgust, and shall bring
them against you from every side: 
Ezek
23:23  the Baḇelians, and all the
Chaldeans, Peqoḏ, and Showa, and Qowa, all the sons of Ashshur with them,
all of them desirable young men, governors and rulers, officers and men of
name, all of them riding on horses. 
Ezek
23:24  ‘And they shall come against you
with battle-axe, chariots, and vehicles, and with an assembly of peoples. They
shall set against you armour, and shield, and helmet all around. And I shall
commit the judgment to them, and they shall judge you according to their
rulings. 
Ezek
23:25  ‘And I shall set My jealousy
against you and they shall deal heatedly with you. They shall cut off your nose
and your ears, while the rest of you fall by the sword. Your sons and your
daughters they shall take away, while the rest of you shall be consumed by
fire. 
Ezek
23:26  ‘And they shall strip you of your
garments and shall take your pretty jewels. 
Ezek
23:27  ‘And I shall put an end to your
wickedness and to your whorings from the land of Mitsrayim, so that you do not
lift your eyes to them neither remember Mitsrayim any more.’ 
Ezek
23:28  “For thus said the Master יהוה,
‘See, I am giving you into the hand of those whom you hate, into the hand of
those from whom your being turned in disgust. 
Ezek
23:29  ‘And they shall deal with you in
hatred, and they shall take away all you have worked for, and they shall leave
you naked and bare. And the nakedness of your whorings shall be uncovered, and
the wickedness of your whorings. 
Ezek
23:30  ‘I do this to you because of your
whoring after the gentiles, because you have been defiled by their idols. 
Ezek
23:31  ‘You have walked in the way of
your sister, and I shall give her cup into your hand.’ 
Ezek
23:32  “Thus said the Master יהוה,
‘Drink of your sister’s cup, the deep and wide one – you being laughed at and
mocked at – for it holds much. 
Ezek
23:33  ‘Be filled with drunkenness and
sorrow, the cup of astonishment and ruin, the cup of your sister Shomeron. 
Ezek
23:34  ‘And you shall drink it and shall
drain it, and gnaw its shards, and tear at your own breasts. For I have spoken,’
declares the Master יהוה. 
Ezek
23:35  “Therefore thus said the Master יהוה,
‘Because you have forgotten Me and cast Me behind your back, therefore you
shall bear your wickedness and your whorings.’ ” 
Ezek
23:36  And יהוה
said to me, “Son of man, judge Oholah and Oholiḇah! And declare to them
their abominations. 
Ezek
23:37  “For they have committed adultery,
and blood is on their hands. And they have committed adultery with their idols,
and even offered their sons whom they bore to Me, passing them through the fire, to devour. 
Ezek
23:38  “They also did this to Me: They
have defiled My set-apart place on the same day, and they have profaned My
Sabbaths. 
Ezek
23:39  “For when they had slain their
children for their idols, on the same day they came into My set-apart place to
profane it. And see, that is what they did in the midst of My House. 
Ezek
23:40  “And they even sent for men to
come from afar, to whom a messenger was sent. And see, they came – for whom you
washed yourself, painted your eyes, and adorned yourself with ornaments. 
Ezek
23:41  “And you sat on a splendid couch,
with a table prepared before it, on which you had set My incense and My oil. 
Ezek
23:42  “And the sound of a crowd at ease
was with her, and drunkards were brought from the wilderness with men of the
commonest sort. And they put bracelets on their wrists and pretty crowns on
their heads. 
Ezek
23:43  “Then I said concerning the one
worn out in adulteries, ‘Now let them commit her whorings, even hers!’ 
Ezek
23:44  “And they went in to her, as men
go in to a woman who is a whore. Thus they went in to Oholah and Oholiḇah,
the wicked women. 
Ezek
23:45  “But let righteous men judge them
with the judgment of adulteresses, and the judgment of women who shed blood,
for they are adulteresses, and blood is on their hands. 
Ezek
23:46  “For thus said the Master יהוה,
‘Bring up an assembly against them, give them up to maltreatment and plunder. 
Ezek
23:47  ‘And the assembly shall stone them
with stones and cut them with their swords. They shall slay their sons and
their daughters, and burn their houses with fire. 
Ezek
23:48  ‘And I shall put an end to
wickedness in the land, and all the women shall be instructed not to commit
wickedness as you have done. 
Ezek
23:49  ‘And they shall put your
wickedness on you, and you shall bear the sins of your idols. And you shall
know that I am the Master יהוה.’ ” 
Ezek
24:1  And in the ninth year, in the tenth
month, on the tenth of the month, the word of יהוה came
to me, saying, 
Ezek
24:2  “Son of man, write down the name of
the day, for on this same day the sovereign of Baḇel has thrown himself
against Yerushalayim. 
Ezek
24:3  “And speak a parable to the
rebellious house, and you shall say to them, ‘Thus said the Master יהוה,
“Put on a pot, put it on, and also pour water into it. 
Ezek
24:4  “Gather pieces of meat in it, every
good piece, the thigh and the shoulder, fill it with choice bones. 
Ezek
24:5  “Take the choice of the flock, also
pile bones under it, cook it thoroughly, also let the bones cook in it.” 
Ezek
24:6  ‘Therefore thus said the Master יהוה,
“Woe to the city of blood, to the pot in which there is rust, and whose rust
has not gone out of it! Bring it out piece by piece, on which no lot has
fallen. 
Ezek
24:7  “For her blood is in her midst. She
has set it on a shining rock. She did not pour it on the ground, to cover it
with dust. 
Ezek
24:8  “To stir up wrath and take
vengeance, I have set her blood on a shining rock, so that it would not be
covered.” 
Ezek
24:9  ‘Therefore thus said the Master יהוה,
“Woe to the city of blood! Let Me also make the pile great. 
Ezek
24:10  “Heap on the wood, kindle the
fire, cook the meat well, mixing in the spices, and let the bones be burned up.

Ezek
24:11  “And set it on the coals, empty,
so that it gets hot, and its bronze glows. And its filthiness shall be melted
in it, and its rust be consumed. 
Ezek
24:12  “She has wearied herself with
sorrows, and her great rust has not gone from her. Into the fire with her rust!

Ezek
24:13  “In your filthiness is wickedness.
Because I have cleansed you, but you are not clean. You shall not be cleansed
of your filthiness any more, till I have caused My wrath to rest upon you. 
Ezek
24:14  “I, יהוה,
have spoken. It shall come, and I shall do it. I do not hold back, nor do I
pardon, nor do I relent. According to your ways and according to your deeds
they shall judge you,” declares the Master יהוה.’ ” 
Ezek
24:15  And the word of יהוה
came to me, saying, 
Ezek
24:16  “Son of man, see, I am taking away
from you the desire of your eyes with one stroke. But do not mourn, nor weep,
nor let your tears run down. 
Ezek
24:17  “Groan silently, make no mourning
for the dead. Bind your turban on your head, and put your sandals on your feet.
Do not cover your upper lip, and do not eat man’s bread of sorrow.” 
Ezek
24:18  And I spoke to the people in the
morning, and in the evening my wife died. And the next morning I did as I was
commanded. 
Ezek
24:19  And the people said to me, “Would you
not explain to us what these matters you are doing mean to us?” 
Ezek
24:20  And I said to them, “The word of יהוה
came to me, saying, 
Ezek
24:21  ‘Speak to the house of Yisra’ĕl,
“Thus said the Master יהוה, ‘See, I am profaning My
set-apart place – the pride of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and the
delight of your being. And your sons and daughters whom you left behind shall
fall by the sword. 
Ezek
24:22  ‘And you shall do as I have done,
do not cover your upper lip nor eat man’s bread of sorrow, 
Ezek
24:23  and let your turbans remain on
your heads and your sandals on your feet. Do not mourn, nor weep, but you shall
pine away in your crookednesses and groan with one another. 
Ezek
24:24  ‘And Yeḥezqĕl shall be
a sign to you. Do according to all that he has done. When this comes, you shall
know that I am the Master יהוה.’ ” 
Ezek
24:25  ‘And you, son of man, on the day
when I take from them their stronghold, the joy of their adorning, the desire
of their eyes, and the lifting up of their being, their sons and their
daughters, 
Ezek
24:26  on that day one that has escaped
shall come to you to let you hear it with your ears. 
Ezek
24:27  ‘On that day your mouth shall be
opened to him who has escaped, and you shall speak and no longer be silent. And
you shall be a sign to them. And they shall know that I am יהוה.’
” 
Ezek
25:1  And the word of יהוה
came to me, saying, 
Ezek
25:2  “Son of man, set your face against
the Ammonites, and prophesy against them. 
Ezek
25:3  “And you shall say to the Ammonites,
‘Hear the word of the Master יהוה ! Thus said the
Master יהוה, “Because you said, ‘Aha!’ against My
set-apart place when it was profaned, and against the land of Yisra’ĕl
when it was ruined, and against the house of Yehuḏah when they went into
exile, 
Ezek
25:4  therefore, see, I am giving you as
a possession to the men of the East, and they shall set their encampments among
you and make their dwellings among you – they shall eat your fruit, and they
shall drink your milk. 
Ezek
25:5  “And I shall make Rabbah a pasture
for camels and Ammon a resting place for flocks. And you shall know that I am יהוה.”

Ezek
25:6  ‘For this is what the Master יהוה
said, “Because you clapped your hands, and you stamped your feet, and rejoiced
with all the scorn of your being against the land of Yisra’ĕl, 
Ezek
25:7  therefore see, I Myself shall
stretch out My hand against you, and give you as plunder to the nations. And I
shall cut you off from the peoples, and make you perish from the lands. I shall
destroy you, and you shall know that I am יהוה.” 
Ezek
25:8  ‘This is what the Master יהוה
said, “Because Mo’aḇ and Sĕ‛ir say, ‘See, the house of Yehuḏah
is like all the gentiles,’ 
Ezek
25:9  therefore, see, I am opening the
flank of Mo’aḇ on the side of the cities, on the side of his cities on
its frontiers, the splendour of the land, Bĕyth Yeshimoth, Ba‛al Me‛on,
and Qiryathayim,
Ezek
25:10  and I shall give it, together with
the Ammonites, as a possession to the men of the East, so that the Ammonites
are no more remembered among the nations. 
Ezek
25:11  “Also on Mo’aḇ I execute
judgments, and they shall know that I am יהוה.” 
Ezek
25:12  ‘Thus said the Master יהוה,
“Because of what Eḏom has done against the house of Yehuḏah by
taking vengeance, so that they became very guilty, and they have taken
vengeance on them,” 
Ezek
25:13  therefore thus said the Master יהוה,
“I shall stretch out My hand against Eḏom, and I shall cut off man and
beast from it and lay it waste – from Tĕman even to Deḏan they shall
fall by the sword. 
Ezek
25:14  “And I shall lay My vengeance on Eḏom
by the hand of My people Yisra’ĕl. And they shall do in Eḏom
according to My displeasure and according to My wrath. So they shall know My
vengeance,” declares the Master יהוה. 
Ezek
25:15  ‘Thus said the Master יהוה,
“Because the Philistines have acted in vengeance, and took vengeance with scorn
in their being, to destroy with
lasting enmity,” 
Ezek
25:16  therefore thus said the Master יהוה,
“See, I am stretching out My hand against the Philistines, and I shall cut off
the Kerĕthites and destroy the remnant of the seacoast, 
Ezek
25:17  and execute great vengeance on
them with raging reproofs. And they shall know that I am יהוה,
when I lay My vengeance upon them.” ’ ”
