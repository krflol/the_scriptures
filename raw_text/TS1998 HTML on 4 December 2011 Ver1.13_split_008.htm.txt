six hundred and three thousand five hundred and fifty. 
Num
1:47  But the Lĕwites were not
registered among them by their fathers’ tribe, 
Num
1:48  because יהוה
had spoken to Mosheh, saying, 
Num
1:49  “Only the tribe of Lĕwi you do
not register, nor take a census of them among the children of Yisra’ĕl. 
Num
1:50  “Instead, appoint the Lĕwites
over the Dwelling Place of the Witness, over all its furnishings, and over all
that belongs to it. They bear the Dwelling Place and all its furnishings, and
they attend to it, and camp around the Dwelling Place. 
Num
1:51  “And when the Dwelling Place is to
go forward, the Lĕwites take it down. And when the Dwelling Place is to be
set up, the Lĕwites set it up. And the stranger who comes near is put to
death. 
Num
1:52  “And the children of Yisra’ĕl
shall pitch their tents, everyone by his own camp, everyone by his own banner,
according to their divisions, 
Num
1:53  but let the Lĕwites camp
around the Dwelling Place of the Witness, so that there be no wrath on the
congregation of the children of Yisra’ĕl. And the Lĕwites shall guard
the duty of the Dwelling Place of the Witness.” 
Num
1:54  And the children of Yisra’ĕl
did according to all that יהוה commanded Mosheh, so
they did. 
Num
2:1  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh and to Aharon, saying, 
Num
2:2  “The children of Yisra’ĕl are
to camp, each one by his own banner, beside the sign of his father’s house. Let
them camp around the Tent of Meeting at a distance.” 
Num
2:3  And on the east side, towards

thousand four hundred and fifty. And they are the second to depart. 
Num
2:17  And the Tent of Meeting, the camp

so they move out, everyone in his place, by their banners. 
Num
2:18  On the west side: the banner of the

2:19  And his army with their registered

of Dan: Aḥi‛ezer, son of Ammishaddai. 
Num
2:26  And his army with their registered

Num
2:27  And those who camp next to him: the

Num
2:28  And his army with their registered
ones: forty-one thousand five hundred.

Num
2:30  And his army with their registered
ones: fifty-three thousand four hundred. 
Num
2:31  All the registered ones of the camp
of Dan: one hundred and fifty-seven thousand six hundred. They depart last,
with their banners. 
Num
2:32  These were registered ones of the
children of Yisra’ĕl by their fathers’ houses. All who were registered
according to their divisions of the camps: six hundred and three thousand five
hundred and fifty. 
Num
2:33  But the Lĕwites were not
registered among the children of Yisra’ĕl, as יהוה
commanded Mosheh. 
Num
2:34  And the children of Yisra’ĕl
did according to all that יהוה commanded Mosheh. So
they camped by their banners and so they departed, each one by his clan,
according to their fathers’ houses. 
Num
3:1  And these are the generations of
Aharon and Mosheh when יהוה spoke with Mosheh on Mount
Sinai. 
Num
3:2  And these are the names of the sons
of Aharon: Naḏaḇ, the first-born, and Aḇihu, El‛azar,
and Ithamar. 
Num
3:3  These are the names of the sons of
Aharon, the anointed priests, whom he ordained to act as priests. 
Num
3:4  And Naḏaḇ and Aḇihu
had died before יהוה when they brought strange fire
before יהוה in the Wilderness of Sinai. And they had no
children. So El‛azar and Ithamar acted as priests in the presence of
Aharon their father. 
Num
3:5  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying, 
Num
3:6  “Bring the tribe of Lĕwi near,
and set them before Aharon the priest, and they shall serve him, 
Num
3:7  and shall guard his duty and the
duty of all the congregation before the Tent of Meeting, to do the service of
the Dwelling Place. 
Num
3:8  “And they shall guard all the furnishings
of the Tent of Meeting, and the duty of the children of Yisra’ĕl, to do
the service of the Dwelling Place. 
Num
3:9  “And you shall give the Lĕwites
to Aharon and his sons. They are the given ones, given to him from among the
children of Yisra’ĕl. 
Num
3:10  “And appoint Aharon and his sons,
and they shall guard their priesthood. And the stranger who comes near shall be
put to death.” 
Num
3:11  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying, 
Num
3:12  “Now look, I Myself have taken the
Lĕwites from among the children of Yisra’ĕl instead of every
first-born who opens the womb among the children of Yisra’ĕl. And the Lĕwites
shall be Mine, 
Num
3:13  because all the first-born are
Mine. On the day that I struck all the first-born in the land of Mitsrayim, I
set apart to Myself all the first-born in Yisra’ĕl, both man and beast.
They are Mine, I am יהוה.” 
Num
3:14  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh in the Wilderness of Sinai, saying, 
Num
3:15  “Register the children of Lĕwi
by their fathers’ houses, by their clans. Register every male from a month old
and above.” 
Num
3:16  So Mosheh registered them according
to the word of יהוה, as he had been commanded. 
Num
3:17  And these were the sons of Lĕwi
by their names: Gĕreshon, and Qehath, and Merari. 
Num
3:18  And these are the names of the sons
of Gĕreshon by their clans: Liḇni and Shim‛i. 
Num
3:19  And the sons of Qehath by their
clans: Amram and Yitshar, Ḥeḇron and Uzzi’ĕl. 
Num
3:20  And the sons of Merari by their
clans: Maḥli and Mushi. These are the clans of the Lĕwites by their
fathers’ houses. 
Num
3:21  From Gĕreshon came the clan of
the Liḇnites and the clan of the Shim‛ites. These were the clans of
the Gĕreshonites. 
Num
3:22  Their registered ones, according to
the number of all the males from a month old and above, their registered ones
were seven thousand five hundred. 
Num
3:23  The clans of the Gĕreshonites
were to camp westward, behind the Dwelling Place,
Num
3:24  and the leader of the fathers’
house of the Gĕreshonites: Elyasaph, son of La’ĕl. 
Num
3:25  And the duty of the children of Gĕreshon
in the Tent of Meeting was the Dwelling Place, and the tent with its covering,
and the covering of the door of the Tent of Meeting, 
Num
3:26  and the screens of the courtyard
and the covering of the door of the courtyard, which is around the Dwelling
Place and the altar, and their cords, according to all its service. 
Num
3:27  And from Qehath came the clan of
the Amramites, and the clan of the Yitsharites, and the clan of the Ḥeḇronites,
and the clan of the Uzzi’ĕlites. These were the clans of the Qehathites. 
Num
3:28  In number, all the males, from a
month old and above, were eight thousand six hundred, guarding the duty of the
set-apart place. 
Num
3:29  The clans of the children of Qehath
were to camp on the south side of the Dwelling Place. 
Num
3:30  And the leader of the fathers’
house of the clans of the Qehathites was Elitsaphan, son of Uzzi’ĕl. 
Num
3:31  And their duty was the ark, and the
table, and the lampstand, and the altars, and the utensils of the set-apart
place used in the service, and the covering, and all its service. 
Num
3:32  And El‛azar, son of Aharon
the priest, was to be chief over the leaders of the Lĕwites, with
oversight of those who guard the duty of the set-apart place. 
Num
3:33  From Merari came the clan of the
Maḥlites and the clan of the Mushites. These were the clans of Merari. 
Num
3:34  And the number of their registered
ones, all the males from a month old and above, were six thousand two hundred. 
Num
3:35  And the leader of the fathers’
house of the clans of Merari was Tsuri’ĕl, son of Aḇiḥayil.
These were to camp on the north side of the Dwelling Place. 
Num
3:36  And the appointed duty of the
children of Merari was the boards of the Dwelling Place, and its bars, and its
columns, and its sockets, and its utensils, and all its service, 
Num
3:37  and the columns of the courtyard
all around, with their sockets, and their pegs, and their cords. 
Num
3:38  And those who were to camp before
the Dwelling Place on the east, before the Tent of Meeting, were Mosheh and
Aharon, and his sons, guarding the duty of the set-apart place, and the duty of
the children of Yisra’ĕl. But the stranger who came near was to be put to
death. 
Num
3:39  All the registered ones of the Lĕwites,
whom Mosheh and Aharon registered at the command of יהוה,
by their clans, all the males from a month old and above, were twenty-two
thousand. 
Num
3:40  And יהוה
said to Mosheh, “Register all the first-born males of the children of Yisra’ĕl
from a month old and above, and take the number of their names. 
Num
3:41  “And you shall take the Lĕwites
for Me – I am יהוה – instead of all the first-born
among the children of Yisra’ĕl, and the livestock of the Lĕwites
instead of all the first-born among the livestock of the children of Yisra’ĕl.”
Num
3:42  And Mosheh registered all the
first-born among the children of Yisra’ĕl as יהוה
had commanded him. 
Num
3:43  And all the first-born males, by
the number of names, from one month old and above of their registered ones,
were twenty-two thousand two hundred and seventy-three. 
Num
3:44  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying, 
Num
3:45  “Take the Lĕwites instead of
all the first-born among the children of Yisra’ĕl, and the livestock of
the Lĕwites instead of their livestock. And the Lĕwites shall be
Mine, I am יהוה. 
Num
3:46  “And for the ransom of the two
hundred and seventy-three of the first-born of the children of Yisra’ĕl,
who are more than the number of the Lĕwites, 
Num
3:47  you shall take five sheqels for
each one, head by head – take it by the sheqel of the set-apart place, the
sheqel of twenty gĕrahs. 
Num
3:48  “And you shall give the silver, the
ransom of those who are in excess among them, to Aharon and his sons.” 
Num
3:49  And Mosheh took the ransom silver
from those who were over and above those who were ransomed by the Lĕwites.

Num
3:50  From the first-born of the children
of Yisra’ĕl he took the silver, one thousand three hundred and sixty-five
pieces, according to the sheqel of the set-apart place. 
Num
3:51  And Mosheh gave their ransom silver
to Aharon, and to his sons, according to the word of יהוה,
as יהוה had commanded Mosheh.
Num
4:1  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, and to Aharon, saying, 
Num
4:2  “Take a census of the sons of Qehath
from among the children of Lĕwi, by their clans, by their fathers’ house, 
Num
4:3  from thirty years old and above,
even to fifty years old, all who enter the service to do the work in the Tent
of Meeting. 
Num
4:4  “This is the service of the sons of
Qehath in the Tent of Meeting, the most set-apart matters: 
Num
4:5  “At the breaking of camp, Aharon and
his sons shall come, and they shall take down the covering veil and cover the
ark of the Witness with it, 
Num
4:6  and shall put on it a covering of
fine leather, and spread over that an all-blue wrapper, and shall insert its
poles. 
Num
4:7  “And on the table of showbread they
shall spread a blue wrapper, and shall put on it the dishes, and the ladles,
and the bowls, and the jars for pouring, and the showbread on it. 
Num
4:8  “And they shall spread over them a
scarlet wrapper, and cover the same with a covering of fine leather, and shall
insert its poles, 
Num
4:9  and shall take a blue wrapper and
cover the lampstand of the light, with its lamps, and its snuffers, and its
trays, and all its oil vessels, by which they serve it. 
Num
4:10  “And they shall put it with all its
utensils in a covering of fine leather, and put it on a bar. 
Num
4:11  “And over the golden altar they
shall spread a blue wrapper, and cover it with a covering of fine leather, and
shall insert its poles, 
Num
4:12  and shall take all the utensils of
service with which they serve in the set-apart place, and shall put them in a
blue wrapper, cover them with a covering of fine leather, and put them on a
bar, 
Num
4:13  and shall remove the ashes from the
altar, and spread a purple wrapper over it, 
Num
4:14  and shall put on it all its
utensils by which they serve there: the fire holders, the forks, and the
shovels, and the basins, and all the utensils of the altar, and shall spread on
it a covering of fine leather, and insert its poles. 
Num
4:15  “And when Aharon and his sons have
finished covering the set-apart objects
and all the furnishings of the Set-apart Place at the breaking of camp, then
the sons of Qehath shall come to lift them, but let them not touch that which
is set-apart, lest they die. These matters
are the burden of the sons of Qehath in the Tent of Meeting. 
Num
4:16  “And the oversight of El‛azar,
son of Aharon the priest, is the oil for the light, and the sweet incense, and
the daily grain offering, and the anointing oil, and the oversight of all the
Dwelling Place and all that is in it, with the set-apart place and its
furnishings.” 
Num
4:17  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, and to Aharon, saying, 
Num
4:18  “Do not cut off the tribe of the
clans of the Qehathites from among the Lĕwites, 
Num
4:19  but do this to them, and they shall
live and not die when they approach the most set-apart objects: Aharon and his sons shall go in and appoint each of them
to his service and his burden. 
Num
4:20  “They are not, however, to go in to
watch while the set-apart objects are
being covered, lest they die.” 
Num
4:21  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying, 
Num
4:22  “Take a census also of the sons of
Gĕreshon, by their fathers’ house, by their clans. 
Num
4:23  “Register them, from thirty years
old and above, even to fifty years old, all who enter to perform the service,
to do the service in the Tent of Meeting. 
Num
4:24  “This is the service of the clans
of the Gĕreshonites, in serving and in bearing burdens: 
Num
4:25  “And they shall bear the curtains
of the Dwelling Place and the Tent of Meeting with its covering, the covering
of fine leather that is on it, the covering for the door of the Tent of
Meeting, 
Num
4:26  and the screens of the courtyard
and the covering for the door of the gate of the courtyard, which is around the
Dwelling Place and altar, and their cords, all the equipment for their service
and all that is made for them – so shall they serve.
Num
4:27  “Aharon and his sons are to command
all the service of the sons of the Gĕreshonites, all their burden and all
their service. And you shall appoint to them all the duty of all their burden. 
Num
4:28  “This is the service of the clans
of the sons of Gĕreshon in the Tent of Meeting. And let their duties be
under the hand of Ithamar, son of Aharon the priest. 
Num
4:29  “As for the sons of Merari,
register them by their clans and by their fathers’ house. 
Num
4:30  “Register them, from thirty years
old and above, even to fifty years old, all who enter the service to do the
work of the Tent of Meeting. 
Num
4:31  “And this is the duty of their
burden, according to all their service for the Tent of Meeting: the boards of
the Dwelling Place, and its bars, and its columns, and its sockets,
Num
4:32  and the columns around the
courtyard with their sockets, and their pegs, and their cords, with all their
equipment and all their service. And assign to
each by name the equipment of the duty of their burden. 
Num
4:33  “This is the service of the clans
of the sons of Merari, as all their service for the Tent of Meeting, under the
hand of Ithamar, son of Aharon the priest.” 
Num
4:34  So Mosheh and Aharon and the
leaders of the congregation registered the sons of the Qehathites by their
clans and by their fathers’ house, 
Num
4:35  from thirty years old and above,
even to fifty years old, all who entered the service for work in the Tent of
Meeting. 
Num
4:36  And their registered ones, by their
clans, were two thousand seven hundred and fifty. 
Num
4:37  These were the registered ones of
the clans of the Qehathites, all those serving in the Tent of Meeting, whom
Mosheh and Aharon registered according to the command of יהוה
by the hand of Mosheh. 
Num
4:38  And those registered ones of the
sons of Gĕreshon, by their clans and by their fathers’ house, 
Num
4:39  from thirty years old and above,
even to fifty years old, all who entered the service for work in the Tent of
Meeting, 
Num
4:40  the registered ones, by their
clans, by their fathers’ house, were two thousand six hundred and thirty. 
Num
4:41  These were the registered ones of
the clans of the sons of Gĕreshon, of all who serve in the Tent of
Meeting, whom Mosheh and Aharon registered according to the command of יהוה.

Num
4:42  And those of the clans of the sons
of Merari who were registered, by their clans, by their fathers’ house, 
Num
4:43  from thirty years old and above,
even to fifty years old, all who entered the service for work in the Tent of

Num
4:44  the registered ones, by their clans

Num
4:45  These were the registered ones of

Num
4:46  All the registered ones of the Lĕwites,
whom Mosheh and Aharon and the leaders of Yisra’ĕl registered, by their

Num
4:47  from thirty years old and above,
even to fifty years old, all who came to do the work of service and the work of
bearing burdens in the Tent of Meeting, 
Num
4:48  their registered ones were eight
thousand five hundred and eighty. 
Num
4:49  According to the command of יהוה
they were registered by the hand of Mosheh, each according to his service and
according to his burden, thus were they registered by him, as יהוה
commanded Mosheh. 
Num
5:1  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying, 
Num
5:2  “Command the children of Yisra’ĕl
to send out of the camp every leper, and everyone who has a discharge, and
whoever becomes defiled for a being.
Num
5:3  “Send out both male and female, send
them outside the camp, so that they do not defile their camps in the midst of
which I dwell.” 
Num
5:4  And the children of Yisra’ĕl
did so, to send them outside the camp. As יהוה had
spoken to Mosheh, so the children of Yisra’ĕl did. 
Num
5:5  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying, 
Num
5:6  “Speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl,
‘When a man or woman commits any sin that men commit in trespass against יהוה,
and that being is guilty, 
Num
5:7  then they shall confess their sin
which they have done. And he shall restore his guilt in its principal, plus
one-fifth of it, and give it to whom he has been guilty. 
Num
5:8  ‘But if the man has no relative to
restore the guilt to, the guilt which is restored goes to יהוה,
for the priest, in addition to the ram of the atonement with which atonement is
made for him. 
Num
5:9  ‘And every contribution of all the
set-apart gifts of the children of
Yisra’ĕl, which they bring to the priest, becomes his. 
Num
5:10  ‘And every man’s set-apart gifts becomes his, whatever any man
gives the priest becomes his.’ ” 
Num
5:11  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying, 
Num
5:12  “Speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl,
and say to them, ‘When any man’s wife turns aside and has committed a trespass
against him, 
Num
5:13  and a man has intercourse with her,
and it is hidden from the eyes of her husband, and it is concealed that she has
defiled herself, and there was no witness against her, nor was she caught, 
Num
5:14  and a spirit of jealousy comes upon
him and he becomes jealous of his wife who has defiled herself, or a spirit of
jealousy comes upon him and he becomes jealous of his wife although she has not
defiled herself, 
Num
5:15  then the man shall bring his wife
to the priest. And he shall bring the offering for her, one-tenth of an ĕphah
of barley flour. He is not to pour oil on it or put frankincense on it, because
it is a grain offering of jealousy, an offering for remembering, for bringing
crookedness to remembrance. 
Num
5:16  ‘And the priest shall bring her
near, and shall make her stand before יהוה. 
Num
5:17  ‘And the priest shall take set-apart
water in an earthen vessel, and take some of the dust that is on the floor of
the Dwelling Place and put it into the water. 
Num
5:18  ‘And the priest shall make the
woman stand before יהוה, and shall uncover the woman’s
head, and put the offering for remembering in her hands, which is the grain
offering of jealousy, while the priest holds in his hand the bitter water that
brings a curse. 
Num
5:19  ‘And the priest shall make her
swear, and say to the woman, “If no man has lain with you, and if you have not
turned aside to uncleanness under your husband’s authority, be free from this bitter water that brings a curse. 
Num
5:20  “But if you have turned aside under
your husband’s authority, and if you
have defiled yourself and some man other than your husband has lain with you” –

Num
5:21  then the priest shall make the
woman swear with the oath of the curse, and he shall say to the woman – “ יהוה
make you a curse and an oath among your people, when יהוה
makes your thigh waste away and your belly swell, 
Num
5:22  and this water that causes the
curse shall go into your inward parts, and make your belly swell and your thigh
waste away.” And the woman shall say, “Amĕn, amĕn.” 
Num
5:23  ‘And the priest shall write these
curses in a book, and shall wipe them off into the bitter water, 
Num
5:24  and shall make the woman drink the
bitter water that brings the curse, and the water that brings the curse shall
enter her to become bitter. 
Num
5:25  ‘And the priest shall take the
grain offering of jealousy from the woman’s hand, and shall wave the offering
before יהוה, and bring it to the altar. 
Num
5:26  ‘And the priest shall take a hand
filled with the offering, as its remembrance offering, and burn it on the
altar, and afterward make the woman drink the water. 
Num
5:27  ‘And when he has made her drink the
water, then it shall be, if she has defiled herself and has committed a
trespass against her husband, that the water that brings the curse shall enter
her and become bitter, and her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall waste
away, and the woman shall become a curse among her people. 
Num
5:28  ‘But if the woman has not defiled
herself, and is clean, then she shall be clear and shall conceive children. 
Num
5:29  ‘This is the Torah of jealousy,
when a wife turns aside under her husband’s authority
and defiles herself, 
Num
5:30  or when a spirit of jealousy comes
upon a man, and he becomes jealous of his wife. Then he shall make the woman
stand before יהוה, and the priest shall do to her all
this Torah. 
Num
5:31  ‘And the man shall be clear from
crookedness, but the woman bear her crookedness.’ ” 
Num
6:1  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying,
Num
6:2  “Speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl,
and say to them, ‘When a man or woman does separate, by making a vow of a
Nazirite, to be separate to יהוה, 
Num
6:3  he separates himself from wine and strong drink – he drinks neither vinegar of
wine nor vinegar of strong drink, neither does he drink any grape juice, nor
eat grapes or raisins. 
Num
6:4  ‘All the days of his separation he
does not eat whatever is made of the grapevine, from seed to skin. 
Num
6:5  ‘All the days of the vow of his
separation a razor does not come upon his head. Until the days are completed
for which he does separate himself to יהוה, he is
set-apart. He shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow long. 
Num
6:6  ‘All the days of his separation to יהוה
he does not go near a dead body. 
Num
6:7  ‘He does not make himself unclean
for his father, or for his mother, for his brother or his sister, when they
die, because his separation to Elohim is on his head. 
Num
6:8  ‘All the days of his separation he
is set-apart to יהוה. 
Num
6:9  ‘And when anyone dies beside him in
an instant, suddenly, and he has defiled the head of his separation, then he
shall shave his head on the day of his cleansing – on the seventh day he shaves
it. 
Num
6:10  ‘And on the eighth day he brings
two turtledoves or two young pigeons to the priest, to the door of the Tent of
Meeting, 
Num
6:11  and the priest shall prepare one as
a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering, and shall make atonement for
him, because he sinned by reason of the dead body. And he shall set apart his
head on that day, 
Num
6:12  and shall separate to יהוה
the days of his separation, and shall bring a male lamb a year old, as a guilt
offering. But the former days are not counted, because his separation was
defiled. 
Num
6:13  ‘And this is the Torah of the
Nazirite: When the days of his separation are completed, he is brought to the
door of the Tent of Meeting, 
Num
6:14  and he shall bring his offering to יהוה
: one male lamb a year old, a perfect one, as a burnt offering, and one ewe
lamb a year old, a perfect one, as a sin offering, and one ram, a perfect one,
as a peace offering, 
Num
6:15  and a basket of unleavened bread,
cakes of fine flour mixed with oil, and unleavened thin cakes anointed with
oil, and their grain offering with their drink offerings. 
Num
6:16  ‘And the priest shall bring them
before יהוה and prepare his sin offering and his burnt
offering. 
Num
6:17  ‘And he shall prepare the ram as a
peace offering to יהוה, together with the basket of
unleavened bread. And the priest shall prepare its grain offering and its drink
offering. 
Num
6:18  ‘And the Nazirite shall shave the
head of his separation at the door of the Tent of Meeting, and shall take the
hair from the head of his separation and shall put it on the fire which is
under the slaughtering of the peace offering. 
Num
6:19  ‘And the priest shall take the
boiled shoulder of the ram, and one unleavened cake from the basket, and one
unleavened thin cake, and put them upon the hands of the Nazirite after he has
shaved his hair of separation. 
Num
6:20  ‘Then the priest shall wave them, a
wave offering before יהוה. It is set-apart for the
priest, besides the breast of the wave offering and besides the thigh of the
contribution. And afterwards the Nazirite shall drink wine.’ 
Num
6:21  “This is the Torah of the Nazirite
who vows to יהוה the offering for his separation, and
besides that, whatever else his hand is able to provide. According to the vow
which he takes, so he shall do according to the Torah of his separation.” 
Num
6:22  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying, 
Num
6:23  “Speak to Aharon and his sons, saying,
‘This is how you bless the children of Yisra’ĕl. Say to them: 
Num
6:24  “ יהוה
bless you and guard you; 
Num
6:25  יהוה make
His face shine upon you, and show favour to you; 
Num
6:26  יהוה lift
up His face upon you, and give you peace.” ’
Num
6:27  “Thus they shall put My Name on the
children of Yisra’ĕl, and I Myself shall bless them.” 
Num
7:1  And it came to be, when Mosheh
finished setting up the Dwelling Place, that he anointed it and set it apart
and all its furnishings, as well as the altar and all its utensils. Thus he
anointed them and set them apart. 
Num
7:2  And the leaders of Yisra’ĕl,
heads of their fathers’ houses who were the leaders of the tribes and over the
ones registered, drew near, 
Num
7:3  and they brought their offering
before יהוה : six covered wagons and twelve cattle, a
wagon for every two of the leaders, and for each one a bull. And they brought
them near before the Dwelling Place. 
Num
7:4  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying, 
Num
7:5  “Accept these from them, and they shall be used in doing the service of the
Tent of Meeting. And you shall give them to the Lĕwites, each one
according to his service.” 
Num
7:6  And Mosheh took the wagons and the
cattle, and gave them to the Lĕwites. 
Num
7:7  He gave two wagons and four cattle
to the sons of Gĕreshon, according to their service. 
Num
7:8  And he gave four wagons and eight
cattle to the sons of Merari, according to their service, under the hand of
Ithamar, son of Aharon the priest. 
Num
7:9  But to the sons of Qehath he gave none,
because theirs was the service of the set-apart objects, which they bore on their shoulders. 
Num
7:10  And the leaders brought the
dedication offering of the altar in
the day it was anointed. So the leaders brought their offering before the
altar. 
Num
7:11  And יהוה
said to Mosheh, “Let them bring their offering, one leader each day, for the
dedication of the altar.” 
Num
7:12  And the one who brought his
offering on the first day was Naḥshon, son of Amminaḏaḇ, from

Num
8:13  “And you shall have the Lĕwites
stand before Aharon and his sons, and then wave them, a wave offering to יהוה.

Num

shall go in to do service in the Tent of Meeting, when you have cleansed them
and waved them as a wave offering. 
Num
8:16  “For they are given ones, given to
Me from among the children of Yisra’ĕl. I have taken them for Myself
instead of all who open the womb, the first-born of all the children of Yisra’ĕl.

Num
8:17  “For all the first-born among the
children of Yisra’ĕl are Mine, both man and beast. On the day that I smote
all the first-born in the land of Mitsrayim I set them apart unto Myself. 
Num
8:18  “And I have taken the Lĕwites
instead of all the first-born of the children of Yisra’ĕl. 
Num
8:19  “And I have given the Lĕwites
as a gift to Aharon and his sons from among the children of Yisra’ĕl, to
do the service of the children of Yisra’ĕl in the Tent of Meeting, and to
make atonement for the children of Yisra’ĕl, that there be no plague among
the children of Yisra’ĕl when the children of Yisra’ĕl come near the
set-apart place.” 
Num
8:20  Thus Mosheh and Aharon and all the
congregation of the children of Yisra’ĕl did to the Lĕwites according
to all that יהוה commanded Mosheh concerning the Lĕwites,
so the children of Yisra’ĕl did to them. 
Num
8:21  And the Lĕwites cleansed
themselves and washed their garments, and Aharon waved them, a wave offering
before יהוה, and Aharon made atonement for them to
cleanse them. 
Num
8:22  Then after that the Lĕwites
went in to do their service in the Tent of Meeting before Aharon and his sons
as יהוה commanded Mosheh concerning the Lĕwites,
so they did to them. 
Num
8:23  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying, 
Num
8:24  “This applies to the Lĕwites:
From twenty-five years old and above let him come into active service in the
service of the Tent of Meeting, 
Num
8:25  and at the age of fifty years they
retire from active service of the service, and serve no more, 
Num
8:26  but they shall attend with their
brothers in the Tent of Meeting, to guard the duty, but shall do no service.
Thus you shall do to the Lĕwites regarding their duties.” 
Num
9:1  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh in the Wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second
year after they had come out of the land of Mitsrayim, saying, 
Num
9:2  “Now, let the children of Yisra’ĕl
perform the Passover at its appointed time. 
Num
9:3  “On the fourteenth day of this
month, between the evenings, perform it at its appointed time. According to all
its laws and right-rulings you perform it.” 
Num
9:4  And Mosheh spoke to the children of
Yisra’ĕl to perform the Passover. 
Num
9:5  So they performed the Passover on
the fourteenth day of the first month, between the evenings, in the Wilderness
of Sinai. According to all that יהוה commanded Mosheh,
so the children of Yisra’ĕl did. 
Num
9:6  But there were men who were defiled
for a being of a man, so that they were not able to perform the Passover on
that day. So they came before Mosheh and Aharon that day, 
Num
9:7  and those men said to him, “We are
defiled for the being of a man. Why are we withheld from bringing near the
offering of יהוה at its appointed time among the
children of Yisra’ĕl?” 
Num
9:8  And Mosheh said to them, “Wait, let
me hear what יהוה commands concerning you.” 
Num
9:9  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying, 
Num
9:10  “Speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl,
saying, ‘When any male of you or your generations is unclean for a being, or is
far away on a journey, he shall still perform the Passover of יהוה.
Num
9:11  ‘On the fourteenth day of the
second month, between the evenings, they perform it – with unleavened bread and
bitter herbs they eat it. 
Num
9:12  ‘They do not leave of it until
morning, and they do not break a bone of it. According to all the laws of the
Passover they perform it. 
Num
9:13  ‘But the man who is clean and is
not on a journey, and has failed to perform the Passover, that same being shall
be cut off from among his people, because he did not bring the offering of יהוה
at its appointed time – that man bears his sin. 
Num
9:14  ‘And when a stranger sojourns among
you, then he shall perform the Passover of יהוה. He
shall do so according to the law of the Passover and according to its
right-ruling. You have one law, both for the stranger and the native of the
land.’ ” 
Num
9:15  And on the day that the Dwelling
Place was raised up, the cloud covered the Dwelling Place, the Tent of the
Witness. From evening until morning it was above the Dwelling Place like the
appearance of fire. 
Num
9:16  Thus it was continually: the cloud
covered it by day, and the appearance of fire by night. 
Num
9:17  And whenever the cloud was taken up
from above the Tent, after that the children of Yisra’ĕl would depart. And
in the place where the cloud dwelt, there the children of Yisra’ĕl would
camp. 
Num
9:18  At the command of יהוה
the children of Yisra’ĕl departed, and at the command of יהוה
they camped. They remained camped as long as the cloud dwelt above the Dwelling
Place. 
Num
9:19  Even when the cloud lingered many
days above the Dwelling Place, the children of Yisra’ĕl guarded the Charge
of יהוה, and did not depart. 
Num
9:20  And so it was, when the cloud was
above the Dwelling Place a few days: according to the command of יהוה
they camped, and according to the command of יהוה they
would depart. 
Num
9:21  And so it was, when the cloud dwelt
only from evening until morning: when the cloud was taken up in the morning,
then they departed. Whether by day or by night, whenever the cloud was taken
up, they departed. 
Num
9:22  Whether two days, or a month, or a
year that the cloud lingered above the Dwelling Place to dwell upon it, the
children of Yisra’ĕl camped, and did not depart. But when it was taken up,
they departed. 
Num
9:23  At the command of יהוה
they camped, and at the command of יהוה they departed.
They guarded the Charge of יהוה, at the command of יהוה
by the hand of Mosheh. 
Num
10:1  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying,
Num
10:2  “Make two silver trumpets for
yourself, make them of beaten work. And you shall use them for calling the
congregation and for breaking camp. 
Num
10:3  “And when they blow both of them,
all the congregation shall meet before you at the door of the Tent of Meeting. 
Num
10:4  “And if they blow one, then the
leaders, the heads of the thousands of Yisra’ĕl, shall gather to you. 
Num
10:5  “And when you blow a shout, the
camps that lie on the east side shall depart. 
Num
10:6  “And when you blow a shout the
second time, then the camps that lie on the south side shall depart – they blow
a shout for them to depart. 
Num
10:7  “And when the assembly is to be
assembled, you blow, but do not shout. 
Num
10:8  “And the sons of Aharon, the
priests, blow with the trumpets. And it shall be to you for a law forever
throughout your generations. 
Num
10:9  “And when you go into battle in
your land against the enemy that distresses you, then you shall shout with the
trumpets, and you shall be remembered before יהוה your
Elohim, and you shall be saved from your enemies. 
Num
10:10  “And in the day of your gladness,
and in your appointed times, and at the beginning of your months, you shall
blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings and over your peace offerings. And
they shall be a remembrance for you before your Elohim. I am יהוה
your Elohim.” 
Num
10:11  And it came to be on the twentieth
day of the second month, in the second year, that the cloud was taken up from
above the Dwelling Place of the Witness. 
Num
10:12  And the children of Yisra’ĕl
departed, setting out from the Wilderness of Sinai. And the cloud dwelt on it in the Wilderness of Paran. 
Num
10:13  Thus they departed the first time,
according to the command of יהוה by the hand of Mosheh.

Num
10:14  And the banner of the camp of the
children of Yehuḏah departed first according to their divisions. And over
their army was Naḥshon, son of Amminaḏaḇ. 
Num
10:15  And over the army of the tribe of
the children of Yissasḵar was Nethanĕ’l, son of Tsu‛ar. 
Num
10:16  And over the army of the tribe of
the children of Zeḇulun was Eliyaḇ, son of Ḥĕlon. 
Num
10:17  And the Dwelling Place was taken
down. And the sons of Gĕreshon and the sons of Merari departed, bearing
the Dwelling Place. 
Num
10:18  And the banner of the camp of Re’uḇĕn
departed according to their divisions. And over their army was Elitsur, son of
Sheḏĕy’ur. 
Num
10:19  And over the army of the tribe of
the children of Shim‛on was Shelumi’ĕl, son of Tsurishaddai. 
Num
10:20  And over the army of the tribe of
the children of Gaḏ was Elyasaph, the son of Deu’ĕl. 
Num
10:21  And the Qehathites departed,
bearing the set-apart objects, while
the Dwelling Place was set up before they came. 
Num
10:22  And the banner of the camp of the
children of Ephrayim departed according to their divisions. And over their army
was Elishama, son of Ammihuḏ. 
Num
10:23  And over the army of the tribe of
the children of Menashsheh was Gamli’ĕl, son of Peḏahtsur. 
Num
10:24  And over the army of the tribe of
the children of Binyamin was Aḇiḏan, son of Giḏ‛oni. 
Num
10:25  Then the banner of the camp of the
children of Dan, which formed the rear guard of all the camps, departed
according to their divisions. And over their army was Aḥi‛ezer, son
of Ammishaddai. 
Num
10:26  And over the army of the tribe of
the children of Ashĕr was Paḡ‛i’ĕl, the son of Oḵran.

Num
10:27  And over the army of the tribe of
the children of Naphtali was Aḥira, the son of Ĕnan. 
Num
10:28  Such was the order of setting out
of the children of Yisra’ĕl, according to their divisions, when they
departed. 
Num
10:29  And Mosheh said to Ḥoḇaḇ,
the son of Re‛uw’ĕl the Miḏyanite, Mosheh’s father-in-law, “We
are setting out for the place of which יהוה said, ‘I
give it to you.’ Come with us, and we shall do good to you, for יהוה
has spoken good concerning Yisra’ĕl.” 
Num
10:30  And he replied to him, “I am not
going, but I am going to my own land and to my relatives.” 
Num
10:31  Then he said, “Please do not leave
us, because you know how we are to camp in the wilderness, and you shall be our
eyes. 
Num
10:32  “And it shall be, when you go with
us, then it shall be that whatever good יהוה does to
us, the same we shall do to you.” 
Num
10:33  So they set out from the mountain
of יהוה on a journey of three days. And the ark of the
covenant of יהוה went before them for the three days’
journey, to seek out a resting place for them. 
Num
10:34  And the cloud of יהוה
was above them by day when they went out from the camp. 
Num
10:35  And it came to be, whenever the
ark set out, that Mosheh said, “Rise up, O יהוה ! And
let Your enemies be scattered, and let those who hate You flee before You.” 
Num
10:36  And when it rested, he said, “Return,
O יהוה, to the countless thousands of Yisra’ĕl.”
Num
11:1  And it came to be, when the people
were as complainers, it was evil in the ears of יהוה.
And יהוה heard it, and His displeasure burned. And the
fire of יהוה burned among them, and consumed those in
the outskirts of the camp. 
Num
11:2  And the people cried out to Mosheh,
and Mosheh prayed to יהוה, and the fire died down. 
Num
11:3  Then he called the name of the
place Taḇ‛ĕrah, because the fire of יהוה
had burned among them. 
Num
11:4  And the mixed multitude who were in
their midst lusted greatly, so the children of Yisra’ĕl also wept again
and said, “Who is giving us meat to eat? 
Num
11:5  “We remember the fish which we ate
without cost in Mitsrayim, the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and
the onions, and the garlic, 
Num
11:6  but now our throat is dried up.
There is naught to look at but this manna!” 
Num
11:7  Now the manna was like coriander
seed, and its appearance like the appearance of bdellium. 
Num
11:8  The people went about and gathered
it, ground it on millstones or beat it in the mortar, and cooked it in a pot,
and made cakes of it. And its taste was as the taste of cakes baked with oil. 
Num
11:9  And when the dew fell on the camp
at night, the manna fell on it. 
Num
11:10  And Mosheh heard the people
weeping throughout their clans, each man at the door of his tent. And the
displeasure of יהוה burned exceedingly. And in the eyes
of Mosheh it was evil, 
Num
11:11  so Mosheh said to יהוה,
“Why have You done evil to Your servant? And why have I not found favour in
Your eyes, to put the burden of all these people on me? 
Num
11:12  “Was it I who conceived all these
people? Was it I who brought them forth, that You should say to me, ‘Carry them
in your bosom, as the foster father carries a nursing child,’ to the land which
You swore to their fathers? 
Num
11:13  “Where am I to get meat to give to
all these people? For they weep before me, saying, ‘Give us meat to eat.’ 
Num
11:14  “I am unable to bear all these
people alone, because the burden is too heavy for me. 
Num
11:15  “And if You are doing this to me,
please slay me altogether, if I have found favour in Your eyes, and let me not
see my evil!” 
Num
11:16  Then יהוה
said to Mosheh, “Gather to Me seventy men of the elders of Yisra’ĕl, whom
you know to be the elders of the people and officers over them. And bring them
to the Tent of Meeting, and let them stand there with you. 
Num
11:17  “And I shall come down and speak
with you there, and shall take of the Spirit that is on you, and put on them.
And they shall bear the burden of the people with you, so that you do not bear
it yourself alone. 
Num
11:18  “And say to the people, ‘Set
yourselves apart for tomorrow, and you shall eat meat, because you have wept in
the hearing of יהוה, saying, “Who is giving us meat to
eat? For it was well with us in Mitsrayim.” And יהוה
shall give you meat, and you shall eat. 
Num
11:19  ‘You are going to eat, not one
day, nor two days, nor five days, nor ten days, nor twenty days, 
Num
11:20  but for a month of days, until it
comes out of your nostrils and becomes an abomination to you, because you have
rejected יהוה who is among you, and have wept before
Him, saying, “Why did we come up out of Mitsrayim?” ’ ” 
Num
11:21  And Mosheh said, “The people in
whose midst I am are six hundred thousand men on foot, and You, You have said, ‘I
give them meat to eat for a month of days.’ 
Num
11:22  “Could flocks and herds be
slaughtered for them, to be sufficient for them? Or could all the fish of the
sea be gathered together for them, to be sufficient for them?” 
Num
11:23  And יהוה
said to Mosheh, “Is the arm of יהוה too short? Now see
whether My word meets you or not!” 
Num
11:24  And Mosheh went out and spoke to
the people the words of יהוה, and he gathered the
seventy men of the elders of the people and placed them around the Tent. 
Num
11:25  And יהוה
came down in the cloud, and spoke to him, and took of the Spirit that was upon
him, and placed the same upon the seventy elders. And it came to be, when the
Spirit rested upon them, that they prophesied, but did not continue. 
Num
11:26  However, two men had remained in
the camp. The name of one was Eldaḏ, and the name of the other Mĕyḏaḏ.
And the Spirit rested upon them. Now they were among those listed, but did not
go out to the Tent. And they prophesied in the camp. 
Num
11:27  And a young man ran and informed
Mosheh, and said, “Eldaḏ and Mĕyḏaḏ are prophesying in
the camp.” 
Num
11:28  And Yehoshua son of Nun, Mosheh’s
assistant from his youth, answered and said, “Mosheh my master, forbid them!” 
Num
11:29  Then Mosheh said to him, “Are you
jealous for my sake? Oh, that all the people of יהוה
were prophets, that יהוה would put His Spirit upon
them!” 
Num
11:30  And Mosheh returned to the camp,
both he and the elders of Yisra’ĕl. 
Num
11:31  And a wind went forth from יהוה,
and it brought quail from the sea and let them fall beside the camp, about a
day’s journey on this side and about a day’s journey on the other side, all
around the camp, and about two cubits above the surface of the ground. 
Num
11:32  And the people were up all that
day, and all that night, and all the next day, and gathered the quail. He who
has least gathered ten ḥomers. And they spread them out for themselves
all around the camp. 
Num
11:33  The meat was still between their
teeth, before it was chewed, and the wrath of יהוה
burned against the people, and יהוה smote the people
with an exceeding great plague. 
Num
11:34  Then he called the name of that
place Qiḇroth Hatta’awah, because there they buried the people who had
lusted. 
Num
11:35  From Qiḇroth Hatta’awah the
people set out for Ḥatsĕroth – and they were at Ḥatsĕroth.

Num
12:1  Now Miryam and Aharon spoke against
Mosheh because of the Kushite woman whom he had taken, for he had taken a
Kushite woman. 
Num
12:2  And they said, “Has יהוה
spoken only through Mosheh? Has He not also spoken through us?” And יהוה
heard it. 
Num
12:3  And the man Mosheh was very humble,
more than all men who were on the face of the earth. 
Num
12:4  And suddenly יהוה
said to Mosheh, and Aharon, and Miryam, “You three, come out to the Tent of
Meeting!” So the three came out. 
Num
12:5  And יהוה
came down in the column of cloud and stood in the door of the Tent, and called
Aharon and Miryam. And they both went forward. 
Num
12:6  And He said, “Hear now My words: If
your prophet is of יהוה, I make Myself known to him in
a vision, and I speak to him in a dream. 
Num
12:7  “Not so with My servant Mosheh, he
is trustworthy in all My house. 
Num
12:8  “I speak with him mouth to mouth,
and plainly, and not in riddles. And he sees the form of יהוה.
So why were you not afraid to speak against My servant Mosheh?” 
Num
12:9  And the displeasure of יהוה
burned against them, and He left. 
Num
12:10  And the cloud turned away from
above the Tent, and look: Miryam was leprous, as white as snow! And Aharon
turned toward Miryam, and look: a leper! 
Num
12:11  And Aharon said to Mosheh, “Oh, my
master! Please do not hold against us the sin in which we have done foolishly
and in which we have sinned. 
Num
12:12  “Please do not let her be as one
dead when coming out of its mother’s womb, with our flesh half consumed!” 
Num
12:13  And Mosheh cried out to יהוה,
saying, “O Ĕl, please heal her, please!” 
Num
12:14  And יהוה
said to Mosheh, “If her father had but spit in her face, would she not be
ashamed seven days? Let her be shut out of the camp seven days, and after that
let her be readmitted.” 
Num
12:15  And Miryam was shut out of the
camp seven days, and the people did not set out until Miryam was readmitted. 
Num
12:16  And afterward the people departed
from Ḥatsĕroth, and they camped in the Wilderness of Paran. 
Num
13:1  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying,
Num
13:2  “Send men to spy out the land of
Kena‛an, which I am giving to the children of Yisra’ĕl. Send one man
from each tribe of their fathers, every one a leader among them.” 
Num
13:3  And by the command of יהוה
Mosheh sent them from the Wilderness of Paran, all of them men who were heads
of the children of Yisra’ĕl. 
Num
13:4  And these were their names. From
the tribe of Re’uḇĕn: Shammua, son of Zakkur. 
Num
13:5  From the tribe of Shim‛on:
Shaphat, son of Ḥori. 
Num
13:6  From the tribe of Yehuḏah:
Kalĕḇ, son of Yephunneh. 
Num
13:7  From the tribe of Yissasḵar:
Yiḡ’al, son of Yosĕph. 
Num
13:8  From the tribe of Ephrayim: Hoshĕa,
son of Nun. 
Num
13:9  From the tribe of Binyamin: Palti,
son of Raphu. 
Num
13:10  From the tribe of Zeḇulun:
Gaddi’ĕl, son of Soḏi. 
Num
13:11  From the tribe of Yosĕph,
from the tribe of Menashsheh: Gaddi, son of Susi. 
Num
13:12  From the tribe of Dan: Ammi’ĕl,
son of Gemalli. 
Num
13:13  From the tribe of Ashĕr: Shĕthur,
son of Miḵa’ĕl. 
Num
13:14  From the tribe of Naphtali:
Naḥbi, son of Wophsi. 
Num
13:15  From the tribe of Gaḏ: Geu’ĕl,
son of Maḵi. 
Num
13:16  These are the names of the men
whom Mosheh sent to spy out the land. And Mosheh called Hoshĕa the son of
Nun, Yehoshua. 
Num
13:17  And Mosheh sent them to spy out
the land of Kena‛an, and said to them, “Go up here into the South, and go
up to the mountains,
Num
13:18  and see what the land is like, and
the people who dwell in it, whether strong or weak, whether few or many, 
Num
13:19  and whether the land they dwell in
is good or evil, whether the cities they inhabit are in camps or strongholds, 
Num
13:20  and whether the land is rich or
poor, and whether there are forests there or not. And you shall be strong, and
bring some of the fruit of the land.” Now the time was the season of the
first-fruits of grapes. 
Num
13:21  So they went up and spied out the
land from the Wilderness of Tsin as far as Reḥoḇ, near the entrance
of Ḥamath. 
Num
13:22  And they went up through the South
and came to Ḥeḇron. And Aḥiman, Shĕshai, and Talmai, the
descendants of Anaq, were there. Now Ḥeḇron had been built seven
years before Tso‛an in Mitsrayim. 
Num
13:23  And they came to the wadi Eshkol,
and cut down from there a branch with one cluster of grapes. And they bore it
between two of them on a pole, also of the pomegranates and of the figs. 
Num
13:24  That place was called the wadi
Eshkol, because of the cluster which the men of Yisra’ĕl cut down from
there. 
Num
13:25  And they returned from spying out
the land after forty days. 
Num
13:26  And they went and came to Mosheh
and Aharon and all the congregation of the children of Yisra’ĕl in the
Wilderness of Paran, at Qaḏĕsh. And they brought back word to them
and to all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land. 
Num
13:27  And they reported to him, and
said, “We went to the land where you sent us. And truly, it flows with milk and
honey, and this is its fruit. 
Num
13:28  “But the people who dwell in the
land are strong, and the cities are walled, very great. And we saw the
descendants of Anaq there too. 
Num
13:29  “The Amalĕqites dwell in the
land of the South, while the Ḥittites and the Yeḇusites and the
Amorites dwell in the mountains. And the Kena‛anites dwell by the sea and
along the banks of the Yardĕn.” 
Num
13:30  And Kalĕḇ silenced the
people before Mosheh, and said, “Let us go up at once and take possession, for
we are certainly able to overcome it.” 
Num
13:31  But the men who had gone up with
him said, “We are not able to go up against the people, for they are stronger
than we.” 
Num
13:32  And they gave the children of
Yisra’ĕl an evil report of the land which they had spied out, saying, “The
land through which we have gone as spies is a land eating up its inhabitants,
and all the people whom we saw in it are men of great size. 
Num
13:33  “And we saw there the Nephilim,
sons of Anaq, of the Nephilim. And we were like grasshoppers in our own eyes,
and so we were in their eyes.” 
Num
14:1  Then all the congregation lifted up
their voices and cried, and the people wept that night. 
Num
14:2  And all the children of Yisra’ĕl
grumbled against Mosheh and against Aharon, and all the congregation said to
them, “If only we had died in the land of Mitsrayim! Or if only we had died in
this wilderness! 
Num
14:3  “And why is יהוה
bringing us to this land to fall by the sword, that our wives and children
should become a prey? Would it not be better for us to turn back to Mitsrayim?”

Num
14:4  And they said to each other, “Let
us appoint a leader, and let us turn back to Mitsrayim.” 
Num
14:5  Then Mosheh and Aharon fell on
their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of
Yisra’ĕl. 
Num
14:6  And Yehoshua son of Nun, and Kalĕḇ
son of Yephunneh, who were among those who had spied out the land, tore their
garments, 
Num
14:7  and they spoke to all the
congregation of the children of Yisra’ĕl, saying, “The land we passed
through to spy out is an exceedingly good land. 
Num
14:8  “If יהוה
has delighted in us, then He shall bring us into this land and give it to us, ‘a
land which is flowing with milk and honey.’ 
Num
14:9  “Only, do not rebel against יהוה,
nor fear the people of the land, for they are our bread. Their defence has turned
away from them, and יהוה is with us. Do not fear them.”

Num
14:10  But all the congregation said to
stone them with stones. Then the esteem of יהוה
appeared in the Tent of Meeting before all the children of Yisra’ĕl. 
Num
14:11  And יהוה
said to Mosheh, “How long shall I be scorned by these people? And how long
shall I not be trusted by them, with all the signs which I have done in their
midst? 
Num
14:12  “Let Me smite them with the
pestilence and disinherit them, and make of you a nation greater and mightier
than they.” 
Num
14:13  And Mosheh said to יהוה,
“Then the Mitsrites shall hear it, for by Your power You brought these people
up from their midst, 
Num
14:14  and they shall say to the
inhabitants of this land they have heard that You, יהוה,
are in the midst of these people, that You, יהוה, are
seen eye to eye and that Your cloud stands above them, and You go before them
in a column of cloud by day and in a column of fire by night. 
Num
14:15  “Now if You shall kill these
people as one man, then the nations which have heard of Your report shall
speak, saying, 
Num
14:16  ‘Because יהוה
was not able to bring this people to the land which He swore to give them,
therefore He killed them in the wilderness.’ 
Num
14:17  “And now, I pray, let the power of
יהוה be great, as You have spoken, saying, 
Num
14:18  ‘ יהוה is
patient and of great kindness, forgiving crookedness and transgression, but by
no means leaving unpunished; visiting the crookedness of the fathers on the children
to the third and fourth generation.’
Num
14:19  “Please forgive the crookedness of
this people, according to the greatness of Your kindness, as You have forgiven
this people, from Mitsrayim even until now.” 
Num
14:20  And יהוה
said, “I shall forgive, according to your word, 
Num
14:21  but truly, as I live and all the
earth is filled with the esteem of יהוה, 
Num
14:22  for none of these men who have
seen My esteem and the signs which I did in Mitsrayim and in the wilderness,
and have tried Me now these ten times, and have disobeyed My voice, 
Num
14:23  shall see the land of which I
swore to their fathers, nor any of those who scorned Me see it. 
Num
14:24  “But My servant Kalĕḇ,
because he has a different spirit in him and has followed Me completely, I
shall bring into the land where he went, and his seed shall inherit it. 
Num
14:25  “Since the Amalĕqites and the
Kena‛anites are dwelling in the valley, turn back tomorrow and set out
into the wilderness by the Way of the Sea of Reeds.” 
Num
14:26  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, and to Aharon, saying, 
Num
14:27  “How long shall this evil
congregation have this grumbling against Me? I have heard the grumblings which
the children of Yisra’ĕl are grumbling against Me. 
Num
14:28  “Say to them, ‘As I live,’ declares
יהוה, ‘as you have spoken in My hearing, so I do to
you: 
Num
14:29  ‘The carcasses of you who have
grumbled against Me are going to fall in this wilderness, all of you who were
registered, according to your entire number, from twenty years old and above. 
Num
14:30  ‘None of you except Kalĕḇ
son of Yephunneh, and Yehoshua son of Nun, shall enter the land which I swore I
would make you dwell in. 
Num
14:31  ‘But your little ones, whom you
said would become a prey, I shall bring in, and they shall know the land which
you have rejected. 
Num
14:32  ‘But as for you, your carcasses
are going to fall in this wilderness. 
Num
14:33  ‘And your sons shall be wanderers
in the wilderness forty years, and shall bear your whorings, until your
carcasses are consumed in the wilderness. 
Num
14:34  ‘According to the number of the
days in which you spied out the land, forty days – a day for a year, a day for
a year – you are to bear your crookednesses forty years, and you shall know My
breaking off. 
Num
14:35  ‘I am יהוה,
I have spoken, I shall do this to all this evil congregation who are meeting
against Me: In this wilderness they are consumed, and there they die.’ ” 
Num
14:36  And the men whom Mosheh sent to
spy out the land, who returned and made all the congregation grumble against
him by bringing an evil report of the land, 
Num
14:37  even those men who brought the
evil report about the land, died by the plague before יהוה.

Num
14:38  Of those men who went to spy out
the land, only Yehoshua son of Nun, and Kalĕḇ son of Yephunneh
remained alive. 
Num
14:39  And when Mosheh spoke these words
to all the children of Yisra’ĕl, the people mourned greatly. 
Num
14:40  And they rose up early in the
morning and went up to the top of the mountain, saying, “See, we have indeed
sinned, but we shall go up to the place which יהוה had
spoken of!” 
Num
14:41  But Mosheh said, “Why do you now
transgress the command of יהוה, since it does not
prosper? 
Num
14:42  “Do not go up, lest you be smitten
by your enemies, for יהוה is not in your midst. 
Num
14:43  “Because the Amalĕqites and
the Kena‛anites are there before you, and you shall fall by the sword.
Because you have turned away from יהוה, יהוה
is not with you.” 
Num
14:44  But they presumed to go up to the
mountaintop, but neither the ark of the covenant of יהוה
nor Mosheh left the camp. 
Num
14:45  So the Amalĕqites and the
Kena‛anites who dwelt in that mountain came down and smote them, and beat
them down, even to Ḥormah. 
Num
15:1  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying,
Num
15:2  “Speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl,
and say to them, ‘When you have come into the land of your dwellings, which I
am giving you, 
Num
15:3  and you make an offering by fire to
יהוה, a burnt offering or a slaughtering, to accomplish
a vow or as a voluntary offering or in your appointed times, to make a sweet
fragrance to יהוה, from the herd or the flock, 
Num
15:4  then he who brings near his
offering to יהוה shall bring near a grain offering of
one-tenth of an ĕphah of fine
flour mixed with one-fourth of a hin of oil, 
Num
15:5  and one-fourth of a hin of wine as
a drink offering you prepare with the burnt offering or the slaughtering, for
each lamb. 
Num
15:6  ‘Or for a ram you prepare as a
grain offering two-tenths of an ĕphah
of fine flour mixed with one-third of a hin of oil, 
Num
15:7  and as a drink offering you bring
one-third of a hin of wine as a sweet fragrance to יהוה.

Num
15:8  ‘And when you prepare a young bull
as a burnt offering, or as a slaughtering to accomplish a vow, or as a peace
offering to יהוה, 
Num
15:9  then shall be brought with the
young bull a grain offering of three-tenths of
an ĕphah of fine flour mixed with half a hin of oil, 
Num
15:10  and bring as the drink offering
half a hin of wine as an offering made by fire, a sweet fragrance to יהוה.

Num
15:11  ‘This is what is done for each
young bull, for each ram, or for each lamb or young goat. 
Num
15:12  ‘According to the number that you
prepare, so you do for each one according to their number. 
Num
15:13  ‘Let all who are native do so with
them, in bringing near an offering made by fire, a sweet fragrance to יהוה.

Num
15:14  ‘And when a stranger sojourns with
you, or whoever is among you throughout your generations, and would make an
offering made by fire, a sweet fragrance to יהוה, as
you do, so he does. 
Num
15:15  ‘One law is for you of the
assembly and for the stranger who sojourns with you – a law forever throughout
your generations. As you are, so is the stranger before יהוה.

Num
15:16  ‘One Torah and one right-ruling is
for you and for the stranger who sojourns with you.’ ” 
Num
15:17  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying, 
Num
15:18  “Speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl,
and say to them, ‘When you come into the land to which I bring you, 
Num
15:19  then it shall be, when you eat of
the bread of the land, that you present a contribution to יהוה.

Num
15:20  ‘Present a cake of the first of
your dough as a contribution – as a contribution of the threshing-floor you
present it. 
Num
15:21  ‘Of the first of your dough you
are to give to יהוה a contribution throughout your
generations. 
Num
15:22  ‘And when you sin by mistake, and
do not do all these commands which יהוה has spoken to
Mosheh, 
Num
15:23  all that יהוה
has commanded you by the hand of Mosheh, from the day יהוה
gave command and onward throughout your generations, 
Num
15:24  then it shall be, if it is done by
mistake, without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation
shall prepare one young bull as a burnt offering, as a sweet fragrance to יהוה,
with its grain offering and its drink offering, according to the right-ruling,
and one male goat as a sin offering. 
Num
15:25  ‘Then the priest shall make
atonement for all the congregation of the children of Yisra’ĕl, and it
shall be forgiven them, for it was by mistake. And they shall bring their
offering, an offering made by fire to יהוה, and their
sin offering before יהוה, for their mistake. 
Num
15:26  ‘And it shall be forgiven all the
congregation of the children of Yisra’ĕl and the stranger who sojourns in
their midst, because all the people did it by mistake. 
Num
15:27  ‘And if a being sins by mistake,
then he shall bring a female goat a year old as a sin offering. 
Num
15:28  ‘And the priest shall make
atonement for the being who strays by mistake, when he sins by mistake before יהוה,
to make atonement for him, and it shall be forgiven him. 
Num
15:29  ‘For him who does whatever by mistake there is one Torah,
both for him who is native among the children of Yisra’ĕl and for the
stranger who sojourns in their midst. 
Num
15:30  ‘But the being who does whatever defiantly, whether he is native
or a stranger, he reviles יהוה, and that being shall be
cut off from among his people. 
Num
15:31  ‘Because he has despised the word
of יהוה, and has broken His command, that being shall
certainly be cut off, his crookedness is upon him.’ ” 
Num
15:32  And while the children of Yisra’ĕl
were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering sticks on the Sabbath day. 
Num
15:33  And those who found him gathering
sticks brought him to Mosheh and to Aharon, and to all the congregation. 
Num
15:34  And they put him in under guard,
because it had not been declared what should be done to him. 
Num
15:35  And יהוה
said to Mosheh, “The man shall certainly be put to death, all the congregation
stoning him with stones outside the camp.” 
Num
15:36  And all the congregation brought
him outside the camp and stoned him with stones, as יהוה
commanded Mosheh, and he died. 
Num
15:37  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying, 
Num
15:38  “Speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl,
and you shall say to them to make tzitziyot on the corners of their garments
throughout their generations, and to put a blue cord in the tzitzit of the
corners.
Num
15:39  “And it shall be to you for a
tzitzit, and you shall see it, and shall remember all the commands of יהוה
and shall do them, and not search after your own heart and your own eyes after
which you went whoring, 
Num
15:40  so that you remember, and shall do
all My commands, and be set-apart unto your Elohim. 
Num
15:41  “I am יהוה
your Elohim, who brought you out of the land of Mitsrayim, to be your Elohim. I
am יהוה your Elohim.” 
Num
16:1  And Qoraḥ, son of Yitshar,
son of Qehath, son of Lĕwi, took both Dathan and Aḇiram the sons of
Eliyaḇ, and On, son of Peleth, sons of Re’uḇĕn, 
Num
16:2  and they rose up before Mosheh with
some of the children of Yisra’ĕl, two hundred and fifty leaders of the
congregation, called ones of the meeting, men of name. 
Num
16:3  And they assembled against Mosheh
and against Aharon, and said to them, “Enough of you! For all the congregation
is set-apart, all of them, and יהוה is in their midst.
Why then do you lift up yourselves above the assembly of יהוה
?” 
Num
16:4  And when Mosheh heard, he fell on
his face, 
Num
16:5  and spoke to Qoraḥ and all
his company, saying, “Tomorrow morning יהוה shall make
known who is His and who is set-apart, and bring him near to Him. And let Him bring near to Him the one whom He
chooses. 
Num
16:6  “Do this: Take fire holders,
Qoraḥ and all your company, 
Num
16:7  and put fire in them and put
incense in them before יהוה tomorrow. And it shall be
that the one whom יהוה chooses is the set-apart one.
Enough of you, sons of Lĕwi!” 
Num
16:8  And Mosheh said to Qoraḥ, “Hear
now, you sons of Lĕwi: 
Num
16:9  “Is it little to you that the
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl has separated you from the congregation of Yisra’ĕl,
to bring you near to Himself, to perform the service of the Dwelling Place of יהוה,
and to stand before the congregation to serve them,
Num
16:10  and that He has brought you near
to Himself, you and all your brothers, the sons of Lĕwi, with you? Yet you
seek the priesthood as well? 
Num
16:11  “Therefore you and all your
company are set against יהוה. And Aharon, what is he
that you grumble against him?” 
Num
16:12  And Mosheh sent to call Dathan and
Aḇiram the sons of Eliyaḇ, but they said, “We are not coming up! 
Num
16:13  “Is it little that you have
brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the
wilderness, that you would also seize total rule over us? 
Num
16:14  “Also, you have not brought us
into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us inheritance of fields and
vineyards. Would you bore out the eyes of these men? We are not coming up!” 
Num
16:15  And Mosheh became very displeased,
and said to יהוה, “Do not respect their offering. I
have not taken one donkey from them, nor have I done harm to any of them.” 
Num
16:16  Then Mosheh said to Qoraḥ, “Tomorrow,
you and all your company shall be there before יהוה,
you and they and Aharon. 
Num
16:17  “And take each one his fire
holder, and you shall put incense in it. And let each one bring his fire holder
before יהוה, two hundred and fifty fire holders, and
you and Aharon, each one with his fire holder.” 
Num
16:18  So each one took his fire holder,
and put fire in it, and laid incense on it, and stood at the door of the Tent
of Meeting with Mosheh and Aharon. 
Num
16:19  And Qoraḥ assembled all the
congregation against them at the door of the Tent of Meeting. Then the esteem
of יהוה appeared to all the congregation. 
Num
16:20  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, and to Aharon, saying, 
Num
16:21  “Separate yourselves from the
midst of this congregation, and let Me consume them in a moment.” 
Num
16:22  But they fell on their faces, and
said, “O Ĕl, Elohim of the spirits of all flesh! When one man sins, are
You wroth with all the congregation?” 
Num
16:23  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying, 
Num
16:24  “Speak to the congregation,
saying, ‘Move away from around the tents of Qoraḥ, Dathan, and Aḇiram.’
” 
Num
16:25  So Mosheh rose up and went to
Dathan and Aḇiram, and the elders of Yisra’ĕl followed him. 
Num
16:26  And he spoke to the congregation,
saying, “Please turn away from the tents of these wrong men! Do not touch
whatever belongs to them, lest you be consumed in all their sins.” 
Num
16:27  Then they moved away from around
the tents of Qoraḥ, Dathan, and Aḇiram. And Dathan and Aḇiram
came out and stood at the door of their tents, with their wives, and their
sons, and their little children. 
Num
16:28  And Mosheh said, “By this you know
that יהוה has sent me to do all these works, that they are not from my own heart. 
Num
16:29  “If these die as all men do, or if
they are visited as all men are visited, then יהוה has
not sent me. 
Num
16:30  “But if יהוה
creates what is unheard of, and the earth opens its mouth and swallows them up
with all that belongs to them, and they go down alive into the grave, then you
shall know that these men have scorned יהוה.” 
Num
16:31  And it came to be, as he ended
speaking all these words, that the ground under them split apart, 
Num
16:32  and the earth opened its mouth and
swallowed them up, with their households and all the men with Qoraḥ, with
all their goods. 
Num
16:33  So they and all those with them
went down alive into the grave, and the earth closed over them, and they
perished from the midst of the assembly. 
Num
16:34  And all Yisra’ĕl who were
round about them fled at their cry, for they said, “Lest the earth swallow us
up!” 
Num
16:35  And a fire came out from יהוה
and consumed the two hundred and fifty men who were offering incense. 
Num
16:36  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying, 
Num
16:37  “Say to El‛azar, son of
Aharon the priest, to pick up the fire holders out of the blaze, for they are
set-apart, and scatter the fire some distance away. 
Num
16:38  “The fire holders of these men who
sinned against their own lives, let them be made into beaten plates as a
covering for the altar. Because they brought them before יהוה,
therefore they are set-apart. And let them become a sign to the children of
Yisra’ĕl.” 
Num
16:39  And El‛azar the priest took
the bronze fire holders, which those who were burned up had brought, and they
were beaten out as a covering on the altar – 
Num
16:40  a remembrance to the children of
Yisra’ĕl that no stranger who is not of the seed of Aharon, should come
near to offer incense before יהוה, and not be like
Qoraḥ and his company – as יהוה had said to him
through Mosheh. 
Num
16:41  But all the congregation of the
children of Yisra’ĕl grumbled against Mosheh and against Aharon on the
next day, saying, “You, you have killed the people of יהוה.”

Num
16:42  And it came to be, when the
congregation assembled against Mosheh and against Aharon, that they turned
toward the Tent of Meeting. And see, the cloud covered it, and the esteem of יהוה
appeared. 
Num
16:43  And Mosheh and Aharon came before
the Tent of Meeting. 
Num
16:44  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying, 
Num
16:45  “Arise from amidst this
congregation, and let Me consume them in a moment.” And they fell on their
faces. 
Num
16:46  So Mosheh said to Aharon, “Take
the fire holder and put fire in it from the altar, and lay incense on, and go,
hurry to the congregation and make atonement for them, for wrath has gone out
from יהוה, the plague has begun.” 
Num
16:47  And Aharon took it as Mosheh
commanded, and ran into the midst of the assembly, and saw that the plague had
begun among the people. And he laid on the incense and made atonement for the
people, 
Num
16:48  and stood between the dead and the
living. And the plague was stopped. 
Num
16:49  And those who died in the plague
were fourteen thousand seven hundred, besides those who died on account of
Qoraḥ. 
Num
16:50  Then Aharon returned to Mosheh at
the door of the Tent of Meeting, for the plague had stopped. 
Num
17:1  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying,
Num
17:2  “Speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl,
and take from them a rod from each father’s house, all their leaders according
to their fathers’ houses, twelve rods. Write each one’s name on his rod, 
Num
17:3  and write Aharon’s name on the rod
of Lĕwi, for there is one rod for the head of each father’s house. 
Num
17:4  “You shall then place them in the
Tent of Meeting before the Witness, where I meet with you.
