and the land was broad, undisturbed and safe, for some Ḥamites had dwelt
there formerly.
1Chron
4:41  And these written by name came in
the days of Ḥizqiyahu sovereign of Yehuḏah, and smote their tents,
and the homes that were found there, and put them under the ban, as it is to
this day, and dwelt in their place, because there was pasture for their flocks
there. 
1Chron
4:42  And some of them, five hundred men
of the sons of Shim‛on, went to Mount Sĕ‛ir, having as their
chiefs Pelatyah, and Ne‛aryah, and Rephayah, and Uzzi’ĕl, the sons
of Yishi. 
1Chron
4:43  And they smote the rest of the Amalĕqites
who had escaped, and dwelt there to this day. 
1Chron
5:1  As for the sons of Re’uḇĕn
the first-born of Yisra’ĕl – he was the first-born, but because he
profaned his father’s bed, his birthright was given to the sons of Yosĕph,
son of Yisra’ĕl, so that the genealogy is not listed according to the
birthright, 
1Chron
5:2  for Yehuḏah prevailed over his
brothers, and from him came a ruler, although the birthright was Yosĕph’s –

1Chron
5:3  the sons of Re’uḇĕn the
first-born of Yisra’ĕl: Ḥanoḵ and Pallu, Ḥetsron and
Karmi.

1Chron
5:8  and Bela son of Azaz, son of Shema,
son of Yo’ĕl, who dwelt in Aro‛ĕr, as far as Neḇo and Ba‛al
Me‛on. 
1Chron
5:9  And he dwelt eastward as far as the
entrance of the wilderness from the River Euphrates, because their livestock
had increased in the land of Gil‛aḏ. 
1Chron
5:10  And in the days of Sha’ul they
fought against the Haḡrites, who fell by their hand. And they dwelt in
their tents over all the eastern part of Gil‛aḏ. 
1Chron
5:11  And the children of Gaḏ dwelt
next to them in the land of Bashan as far as Salḵah: 
1Chron

son of Guni, was chief of their father’s house. 
1Chron
5:16  And they dwelt in Gil‛aḏ,
in Bashan and in its villages, and in all the open lands of Sharon within their
borders. 
1Chron
5:17  All these were registered by
genealogies in the days of Yotham sovereign of Yehuḏah, and in the days
of Yaroḇ‛am sovereign of Yisra’ĕl. 
1Chron
5:18  The sons of Re’uḇĕn, and
the Gaḏites, and half the tribe of Menashsheh had forty-four thousand
seven hundred and sixty brave men, men able to bear shield and sword, to shoot
with the bow, and skilled in battle, going out to the army. 
1Chron
5:19  And they fought against the Haḡrites,
and Yetur, and Naphish, and Noḏaḇ. 
1Chron
5:20  And they were helped against them,
and the Haḡrites were given into their hand, and all who were with them.
For they cried out to Elohim in the battle, and He answered their prayer,
because they put their trust in Him. 
1Chron
5:21  And they took away their livestock:
fifty thousand of their camels, and two hundred and fifty thousand of their
sheep, and two thousand of their donkeys, also one hundred thousand of their
men, 
1Chron
5:22  for many fell dead, because the
battle was of Elohim. And they dwelt in their place until the exile. 
1Chron
5:23  And the children of the half-tribe
of Menashsheh dwelt in the land. They increased from Bashan to Ba‛al Ḥermon,
that is, to Senir, or Mount Ḥermon. 
1Chron
5:24  And these were the heads of their
fathers’ houses: Ĕpher, and Yishi, and Eli’ĕl, and Azri’ĕl, and
Yirmeyah, Hoḏawyah, and Yaḥdi’ĕl – mighty brave men, men of
name, and heads of their fathers’ houses. 
1Chron
5:25  But they trespassed against the
Elohim of their fathers, and whored after the mighty ones of the peoples of the
land, whom Elohim had destroyed before them. 
1Chron
5:26  So the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl
stirred up the spirit of Pul sovereign of Ashshur, even the spirit of
Tiglath-Pileser sovereign of Ashshur. And he took the Re’uḇĕnites,
and the Gaḏites, and the half-tribe of Menashsheh into exile, and brought
them to Ḥalaḥ, and Ḥaḇor, and Hara, and the river of
Gozan, unto this day.

9:2  And the first inhabitants who were
in their possessions in their cities of Yisra’ĕl, were the priests, the Lĕwites,
and the Nethinim.

chief. 
1Chron
9:18  And up till then they were
gatekeepers for the camps of the children of Lĕwi at the Sovereign’s Gate
on the east. 
1Chron
9:19  And Shallum son of Qorĕ, son
of Eḇyasaph, son of Qoraḥ, and his brothers, from his father’s
house, the Qorḥites, were over the work of the service, guards of the
thresholds of the Tent. And their fathers had been guards of the entrance to
the camp of יהוה. 
1Chron
9:20  And Pineḥas son of El‛azar
was leader over them in time past. יהוה was with him. 
1Chron
9:21  Zeḵaryah son of Meshelemyah
was gatekeeper at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting. 
1Chron
9:22  All those chosen as gatekeepers at
the thresholds were two hundred and twelve. They were registered by genealogy,
in their villages. Dawiḏ and Shemu’ĕl the seer had appointed them to
their office of trust. 
1Chron
9:23  So they and their sons were over
the gates of the House of יהוה, the House of the Tent,
by watches. 
1Chron
9:24  The gatekeepers were on the four
sides: the east, west, north, and south. 
1Chron
9:25  And their brothers in their
villages had to come with them from time to time for seven days. 
1Chron
9:26  For the four chief gatekeepers were
in an office of trust. They were Lĕwites, and they were over the rooms and
treasuries of the House of Elohim. 
1Chron
9:27  And they spent the night all around
the House of Elohim because they had the duty, and they were to open it morning
by morning. 
1Chron
9:28  And some of them were over the
vessels of service, for they brought them in and took them out by count. 
1Chron
9:29  And some of them were appointed
over the vessels, even over all the vessels of the set-apart place, and over
the fine flour and the wine and the oil and the incense and the spices. 
1Chron
9:30  And some of the sons of the priests
blended the compound of spices. 
1Chron
9:31  And Mattithyah of the Lĕwites,
the first-born of Shallum the Qorḥite, was entrusted with the making of
the flat cakes. 
1Chron
9:32  And some of their brothers of the
sons of the Qehathites were over the showbread, to prepare every Sabbath. 
1Chron
9:33  And these were the singers, heads
of the fathers’ houses of the Lĕwites, in the rooms, and were exempted
from other duties, for they were employed in that work day and night. 
1Chron
9:34  These heads of the fathers’ houses
of the Lĕwites were heads throughout their generations. They dwelt at
Yerushalayim. 
1Chron
9:35  And Ye‛i’ĕl the father
of Giḇ‛on, whose wife’s name was Ma‛aḵah, dwelt at Giḇ‛on.

1Chron
9:36  And his first-born son was Aḇdon,
then Tsur, and Qish, and Ba‛al, and Nĕr, and Naḏaḇ, 
1Chron
9:37  and Geḏor, and Aḥyo,
and Zeḵaryah, and Miqloth. 
1Chron
9:38  And Miqloth brought forth Shim‛am.
And they too dwelt alongside their relatives in Yerushalayim, with their
brothers. 
1Chron
9:39  And Nĕr brought forth Qish,
and Qish brought forth Sha’ul, and Sha’ul brought forth Yehonathan, and
Malkishua, and Aḇinaḏaḇ, and Esh-Ba‛al. 
1Chron
9:40  And the son of Yehonathan was Meriḇ-Ba‛al,
and Meriḇ-Ba‛al brought forth Miḵah. 
1Chron
9:41  And the sons of Miḵah:
Pithon, and Meleḵ, and Taḥrĕa, 
1Chron
9:42  and Aḥaz, who brought forth
Yarah; and Yarah brought forth Alemeth, and Azmaweth, and Zimri. And Zimri
brought forth Motsa; 
1Chron
9:43  and Motsa brought forth Bin‛a,
and Rephayah was his son, El‛asah his son, Atsĕl his son. 
1Chron
9:44  And Atsĕl had six sons whose
names were these: Azriqam, Boḵeru, and Yishma‛ĕl, and She‛aryah,
and Oḇaḏyah, and Ḥanan. These were the sons of Atsĕl. 
1Chron
10:1  And the Philistines fought against
Yisra’ĕl. And the men of Yisra’ĕl fled from before the Philistines,
and fell slain on Mount Gilboa. 
1Chron
10:2  And the Philistines pursued Sha’ul
and his sons, and the Philistines smote Yonathan, and Aḇinaḏaḇ,
and Malkishua, sons of Sha’ul. 
1Chron
10:3  And the battle was heavy on Sha’ul.
And the archers hit him, and he was wounded by the archers. 
1Chron
10:4  And Sha’ul said to his
armour-bearer, “Draw your sword, and thrust me through with it, lest these
uncircumcised ones come and abuse me.” But his armour-bearer would not, for he
was much afraid, so Sha’ul took a sword and fell on it. 
1Chron
10:5  And when his armour-bearer saw that
Sha’ul was dead, he also fell on his sword and died. 
1Chron
10:6  Thus Sha’ul and his three sons
died, and all his house – they died together. 
1Chron
10:7  And when all the men of Yisra’ĕl
who were in the valley saw that they had fled and that Sha’ul and his sons were
dead, they forsook their cities and fled, and the Philistines came and dwelt in
them. 
1Chron
10:8  And the next day it came to be,
when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Sha’ul and his
sons fallen on Mount Gilboa. 
1Chron
10:9  And they stripped him and took his
head and his armour, and sent word throughout the land of the Philistines to
proclaim the news among their idols and among the people, 
1Chron
10:10  and put his armour in the house of
their mighty ones, and fastened his head in the house of Daḡon. 
1Chron
10:11  And all Yaḇĕsh Gil‛aḏ
heard of all that the Philistines had done to Sha’ul, 
1Chron
10:12  and all the brave men arose and
took the body of Sha’ul and the bodies of his sons. And they brought them to Yaḇĕsh,
and buried their bones under the tamarisk tree at Yaḇĕsh, and fasted
seven days. 
1Chron
10:13  Thus Sha’ul died for his trespass
which he had trespassed against יהוה, because he did
not guard the Word of יהוה, and also for asking a
medium for to make inquiry, 
1Chron
10:14  and did not inquire of יהוה.
So He put him to death, and turned the reign over to Dawiḏ son of Yishai.

1Chron
11:1  And all Yisra’ĕl came together
to Dawiḏ at Ḥeḇron, saying, “See, we are your bone and your
flesh. 
1Chron
11:2  “Also, in time past, even when Sha’ul
was sovereign, you were the one who led Yisra’ĕl out and brought them in.
And יהוה your Elohim said to you, ‘Shepherd My people
Yisra’ĕl, and be ruler over My people Yisra’ĕl.’ ” 
1Chron
11:3  So all the elders of Yisra’ĕl
came to the sovereign at Ḥeḇron, and Dawiḏ made a covenant
with them at Ḥeḇron before יהוה. And they
anointed Dawiḏ sovereign over Yisra’ĕl, according to the word of יהוה
by Shemu’ĕl. 
1Chron
11:4  And Dawiḏ and all Yisra’ĕl
went to Yerushalayim, which is Yeḇus, where the Yeḇusites were, the
inhabitants of the land. 
1Chron
11:5  And the inhabitants of Yeḇus
said to Dawiḏ, “You do not come in here.” But Dawiḏ captured the
stronghold of Tsiyon, the City of Dawiḏ. 
1Chron
11:6  And Dawiḏ said, “Whoever
smites the Yeḇusites first becomes chief and commander.” And Yo’aḇ
son of Tseruyah went up first, and became chief. 
1Chron
11:7  And Dawiḏ dwelt in the
stronghold, so they called it the City of Dawiḏ. 
1Chron
11:8  And he built the city around it,
from Millo round about, and Yo’aḇ revived the rest of the city. 
1Chron
11:9  And Dawiḏ went on and became
great, and יהוה of hosts was with him. 
1Chron
11:10  And these were the heads of the
mighty men whom Dawiḏ had, who strengthened themselves with him in his
reign, with all Yisra’ĕl, to set him up to reign over Yisraĕl,
according to the word of יהוה. 
1Chron
11:11  And this is the number of the
mighty men whom Dawiḏ had: Yashoḇ‛am son of a Ḥaḵmonite,
chief of the thirty. He had lifted up his spear against three hundred, slain at
one time. 
1Chron
11:12  And after him was El‛azar
son of Doḏo, the Aḥoḥite, who was one of the three mighty
men. 
1Chron
11:13  He was with Dawiḏ at
Pasdammim, and the Philistines were gathered there for battle, and a portion of
the field was filled with barley, and the people had fled before the
Philistines. 
1Chron
11:14  But they took their stand in the
midst of that field, and delivered it, and smote the Philistines. Thus יהוה
saved them by a great deliverance. 
1Chron
11:15  And three of the thirty chiefs
went down to the rock to Dawiḏ, into the cave of Aḏullam, while the
army of the Philistines encamped in the Valley of Repha’im. 
1Chron
11:16  And Dawiḏ was then in the
stronghold, and the watch-post of the Philistines was then in Bĕyth
Leḥem. 
1Chron
11:17  And Dawiḏ longed and said, “Oh,
that someone would give me a drink of water from the well of Bĕyth
Leḥem, which is by the gate!” 
1Chron
11:18  And the three broke through the
camp of the Philistines, and drew water from the well of Bĕyth Leḥem
that was by the gate, and took it and brought it to Dawiḏ. But Dawiḏ
would not drink it, but poured it out to יהוה. 
1Chron
11:19  And he said, “Far be it from me, O
my Elohim, that I should do this! Should I drink the blood of these men who
have risked their lives? For at the risk of their lives they brought it.” And
he would not drink it. This is what the three mighty men did. 
1Chron
11:20  And Aḇishai the brother of
Yo’aḇ was chief of another three. And he had lifted up his spear against
three hundred men, who were slain, and won a name among the three. 
1Chron
11:21  Of the three he was more esteemed
than the other two men, so he became their head. However he did not come to the
first three. 
1Chron
11:22  Benayah was the son of Yehoyaḏa,
the son of a brave man from Qaḇtse’ĕl, who had done many deeds. He
smote two lion-like Mo’aḇites. He also went down and smote a lion in the
midst of a pit on a snowy day. 
1Chron
11:23  And he smote a Mitsrian, a man of
great height, five cubits tall. And in the Mitsrian’s hand was a spear like a
weaver’s beam, and he went down to him with a staff and wrenched the spear out
of the Mitsrian’s hand, and slew him with his own spear. 
1Chron
11:24  This is what Benayahu son of
Yehoyaḏa did, and won a name among the three mighty men. 
1Chron
11:25  See, he was more esteemed than the
thirty, but he did not come to the first three. And Dawiḏ set him over
his court. 
1Chron
11:26  And the mighty men of the armies
were Asah’ĕl the brother of Yo’aḇ, Elḥanan son of Doḏo
of Bĕyth Leḥem, 
1Chron
11:27  Shammoth the Harorite, Ḥĕlets
the Pelonite, 
1Chron
11:28  Ira son of Iqqĕsh the

1Chron
11:34  the sons of Hashĕm the
Gizonite, Yonathan son of Shaḡĕ the Hararite, 
1Chron
11:35  Aḥyam son of Saḵar the
Hararite, Eliphal son of Ur, 
1Chron
11:36  Ḥĕpher the Mekĕrathite,
Aḥiyah the Pelonite, 
1Chron
11:37  Ḥetsro the Karmelite, Na‛arai
son of Ezbai, 
1Chron
11:38  Yo’ĕl the brother of Nathan,
Miḇḥar son of Haḡri, 
1Chron
11:39  Tseleq the Ammonite, Naḥarai
the Bĕrothite (the armour-bearer of Yo’aḇ son of Tseruyah), 
1Chron
11:40  Ira the Yithrite, Garĕḇ
the Yithrite, 
1Chron
11:41  Uriyah the Ḥittite, Zaḇaḏ
son of Aḥlai, 
1Chron
11:42  Aḏina son of Shiza the Re’uḇĕnite,
the head of the Re’uḇĕnites, and thirty with him, 
1Chron
11:43  Ḥanan son of Ma‛aḵah,
and Yoshaphat the Mithnite, 
1Chron
11:44  Uzziya the Ashterathite, Shama and
Ye‛i’ĕl the sons of Ḥotham the Aro‛ĕrite, 
1Chron
11:45  Yeḏiya’ĕl son of
Shimri, and Yoḥa his brother, the Titsite, 
1Chron
11:46  Eli’ĕl the Maḥawite,
and Yeriḇai and Yoshawyah the sons of Elna‛am, Yithmah the Mo’aḇite,

1Chron
11:47  Eli’ĕl, and Oḇĕḏ,
and Ya‛asi’ĕl of Metsoḇayah. 
1Chron
12:1  Now these are they who came to Dawiḏ
at Tsiqlaḡ while he was still in hiding from Sha’ul son of Qish. And they
were among the mighty men, helping the battle, 
1Chron
12:2  armed with bows, using both the
right hand and the left, with stones, and with arrows, with bows, of the
brothers of Sha’ul, of Binyamin. 
1Chron
12:3  The chief was Aḥi‛ezer
and Yo’ash, the sons of Shema‛ah the Giḇ‛athite; and Yezaw’ĕl
and Pelet, the sons of Azmaweth; and Beraḵah, and Yĕhu the
Anathothite; 
1Chron
12:4  and Yishmayah the Giḇ‛onite,
a mighty man among the thirty, and over the thirty; and Yirmeyah, and
Yaḥazi’ĕl, and Yoḥanan, and Yozaḇaḏ the Geḏĕrathite;

1Chron
12:5  Eluzai, and Yerimoth, and Be‛alyah,
and Shemaryahu, and Shephatyahu the Ḥaruphite; 
1Chron
12:6  Elqanah, and Yishshiyahu, and Azar’ĕl,
and Yow‛ezer, and Yashoḇ‛am the Qorḥites; 
1Chron
12:7  and Yo’ĕlah and Zeḇaḏyah,
the sons of Yeroḥam of Geḏor. 
1Chron
12:8  And some Gaḏites separated
themselves to Dawiḏ at the stronghold in the wilderness, mighty brave
men, men trained for battle, who could handle shield and spear, whose faces
were like the faces of lions, and were as swift as gazelles on the mountains: 
1Chron
12:9  Ĕzer the chief, Oḇaḏyah
the second, Eliyaḇ the third, 
1Chron
12:10  Mishmannah the fourth, Yirmeyah
the fifth, 
1Chron
12:11  Attai the sixth, Eli’ĕl the

1Chron
12:12  Yoḥanan the eighth, Elzaḇaḏ
the ninth, 
1Chron
12:13  Yirmeyahu the tenth, Maḵbannai
the eleventh. 
1Chron
12:14  These were from the sons of Gaḏ,
chiefs of the army. The least was over a hundred, and the greatest was over a
thousand. 
1Chron
12:15  These were the ones who passed
over the Yardĕn in the first month, when it was overflowing all its banks,
and put to flight all those in the valleys, to the east and to the west. 
1Chron
12:16  And some of the children of
Binyamin and Yehuḏah came to Dawiḏ at the stronghold. 
1Chron
12:17  And Dawiḏ went out to face
them, and answered and said to them, “If you have come peaceably to me to help
me, my heart shall be united with you; but if to betray me to my enemies –
there is no violence in my hands – let the Elohim of our fathers see and
reprove.” 
1Chron
12:18  Then the Spirit came upon Amasai,
chief of the officers, “Yours, O Dawiḏ! And with you, O son of Yishai!
Peace, peace to you, and peace to your helpers! For your Elohim shall help you.”
And Dawiḏ received them, and put them among the chiefs of the raiding
band. 
1Chron
12:19  And some from Menashsheh went over
to Dawiḏ when he was going with the Philistines to battle against Sha’ul.
But they did not help them, for the princes of the Philistines took advice and
sent him away, saying, “He might go over to his master Sha’ul with our heads!” 
1Chron
12:20  When he went to Tsiqlaḡ,
those of Menashsheh who went over to him were Aḏnah, and Yozaḇaḏ,
and Yeḏiya’ĕl, and Miḵa’ĕl, and Yozaḇaḏ, and
Elihu, and Tsillethai, chiefs of the thousands who were from Menashsheh. 
1Chron
12:21  And they helped Dawiḏ
against the raiding bands, for they were all mighty brave men, and they were
commanders in the army. 
1Chron
12:22  For at that time they came to Dawiḏ
day by day to help him, until it was a great army, like an army of Elohim. 
1Chron
12:23  And these were the numbers of the
chiefs of those that were armed for battle, and came to Dawiḏ at Ḥeḇron
to turn over the reign of Sha’ul to him, according to the word of יהוה
: 
1Chron
12:24  Of the children of Yehuḏah
bearing shield and spear, six thousand eight hundred armed for battle; 
1Chron
12:25  of the children of Shim‛on,
mighty brave men for the army, seven thousand one hundred; 
1Chron
12:26  of the children of Lĕwi four
thousand six hundred; 
1Chron
12:27  and Yehoyaḏa, the leader of
the Aharonites, and with him three thousand seven hundred; 
1Chron
12:28  and Tsaḏoq, a young man, a
mighty brave man, and from his father’s house twenty-two commanders; 
1Chron
12:29  and the children of Binyamin,
relatives of Sha’ul, three thousand – until then the greatest part of them
guarded the charge of the house of Sha’ul; 
1Chron
12:30  and the children of Ephrayim
twenty thousand eight hundred, mighty brave ones, men of name throughout their
father’s house; 
1Chron
12:31  and the half-tribe of Menashsheh
eighteen thousand, who were designated by name to come and set up Dawiḏ
to reign; 
1Chron
12:32  and the children of Yissasḵar
who had understanding of the times, to know what Yisra’ĕl should do, their
chiefs were two hundred. And all their brothers were at their command; 
1Chron
12:33  of Zeḇulun there were fifty
thousand going out to the army, arranging battle with all weapons of battle,
giving support with undivided heart; 
1Chron
12:34  and of Naphtali one thousand
commanders, and with them thirty-seven thousand with shield and spear; 
1Chron
12:35  and of the Danites, arranging
battle, twenty-eight thousand six hundred; 
1Chron
12:36  and of Ashĕr, going out to
the army, arranging battle, forty thousand; 
1Chron
12:37  and of the Re’uḇĕnites
and the Gaḏites and the half-tribe of Menashsheh, from beyond the Yardĕn,
one hundred and twenty thousand armed for battle with every kind of weapon of
battle. 
1Chron
12:38  All these men of battle, keeping
rank, came to Ḥeḇron with a perfect heart, to set up Dawiḏ to
reign over all Yisra’ĕl. And all the rest of Yisra’ĕl were of one
heart to set up Dawiḏ to reign. 
1Chron
12:39  And they were there with Dawiḏ
three days, eating and drinking, for their brothers had prepared for them. 
1Chron
12:40  And also those who were near to
them, from as far away as Yissasḵar and Zeḇulun and Naphtali, were
bringing food on donkeys and camels, on mules and cattle – food of flour and
cakes of figs and cakes of raisins, wine and oil and cattle and sheep in great
quantities, for there was joy in Yisra’ĕl. 
1Chron
13:1  And Dawiḏ consulted with the
commanders of thousands and hundreds, and with every leader. 
1Chron
13:2  And Dawiḏ said to all the
assembly of Yisra’ĕl, “If it seems good to you, and if it is of יהוה
our Elohim, let us send out to our brothers everywhere who are left in all the
land of Yisra’ĕl, and with them to the priests and Lĕwites who are in
their cities of their open lands, and let them be gathered to us; 
1Chron
13:3  and let us bring the ark of our
Elohim back to us, for we sought Him not since the days of Sha’ul.” 
1Chron
13:4  And all the assembly agreed to do
so, for the matter was right in the eyes of all the people. 
1Chron
13:5  So Dawiḏ assembled all Yisra’ĕl,
from Shiḥor in Mitsrayim to as far as the entrance of Ḥamath, to
bring the ark of Elohim from Qiryath Ye‛arim. 
1Chron
13:6  And Dawiḏ and all Yisra’ĕl
went up to Ba‛alah, to Qiryath Ye‛arim of Yehuḏah, to bring
up from there the ark of Elohim, יהוה, who dwells
between the keruḥim, where the Name is called on. 
1Chron
13:7  And they placed the ark of Elohim
on a new wagon from the house of Aḇinaḏaḇ, and Uzza and
Aḥyo were leading the wagon. 
1Chron
13:8  And Dawiḏ and all Yisra’ĕl
were playing before Elohim with all their might, and with songs, and with
lyres, and with harps, and with tambourines, and with cymbals, and with
trumpets. 
1Chron
13:9  And when they came to the
threshing-floor of Kiḏon, Uzza put out his hand to hold the ark, for the
oxen stumbled. 
1Chron
13:10  Then the wrath of יהוה
burned against Uzza, and He smote him because he put his hand to the ark. And
he died there before Elohim. 
1Chron
13:11  And Dawiḏ was displeased
because יהוה had broken out against Uzza, therefore
that place is called Perets Uzza, until this day. 
1Chron
13:12  And Dawiḏ was afraid of
Elohim that day, saying, “How shall I bring the ark of Elohim to me?” 
1Chron
13:13  So Dawiḏ did not take the
ark with him into the City of Dawiḏ, but took it aside into the house of
Oḇĕḏ-Eḏom the Gittite. 
1Chron
13:14  And the ark of Elohim remained
with the household of Oḇĕḏ-Eḏom in his house three
months. And יהוה blessed the house of Oḇĕḏ-Eḏom
and all that he had. 
1Chron
14:1  And Ḥiram sovereign of Tsor
sent messengers to Dawiḏ, and cedar trees, with stonemasons and
carpenters, to build him a house. 
1Chron
14:2  And Dawiḏ knew that יהוה
had established him as sovereign over Yisra’ĕl, for his reign was highly
exalted for the sake of His people Yisra’ĕl. 
1Chron
14:3  And Dawiḏ took more wives in
Yerushalayim, and Dawiḏ brought forth more sons and daughters. 
1Chron
14:4  And these are the names of his
children whom he had in Yerushalayim: Shammua and Shoḇaḇ, Nathan and
Shelomoh, 
1Chron
14:5  and Yiḇḥar, and
Elishua, and Elpelet, 
1Chron
14:6  and Noḡah, and Nepheḡ,
and Yaphiya, 
1Chron
14:7  and Elishama, and Be‛elyaḏa,
and Eliphelet. 
1Chron
14:8  And when the Philistines heard that
Dawiḏ had been anointed sovereign over all Yisra’ĕl, all the
Philistines went up to seek Dawiḏ. And Dawiḏ heard and went out
against them. 
1Chron
14:9  And the Philistines came and made a
raid on the Valley of Repha’im. 
1Chron
14:10  And Dawiḏ inquired of
Elohim, saying, “Do I go up against the Philistines? And shall You give them
into my hand?” And יהוה said to him, “Go up, and I
shall give them into your hand.” 
1Chron
14:11  And they went up to Ba‛al
Peratsim, and Dawiḏ smote them there. Then Dawiḏ said, “Elohim has broken
through my enemies by my hand like a breakthrough of water.” So they called the
name of that place Ba‛al Peratsim. 
1Chron
14:12  And they left their mighty ones
there, so Dawiḏ commanded, and they were burned with fire. 
1Chron
14:13  And the Philistines once again
made a raid on the valley. 
1Chron
14:14  And Dawiḏ again inquired of
Elohim, and Elohim said to him, “Do not go up after them. Go around them, and
come upon them in front of the mulberry trees. 
1Chron
14:15  “And it shall be, when you hear a
sound of stepping in the tops of the mulberry trees, then go out to battle, for
Elohim shall go out before you to smite the camp of the Philistines.” 
1Chron
14:16  And Dawiḏ did as Elohim
commanded him, and they drove back the army of the Philistines from Giḇ‛on
as far as Gezer. 
1Chron
14:17  And the name of Dawiḏ went
out into all lands, and יהוה put the dread of him upon
all nations. 
1Chron
15:1  And he built houses for himself in
the City of Dawiḏ. And he prepared a place for the ark of Elohim, and
pitched a tent for it. 
1Chron
15:2  Then Dawiḏ said, “No one is
to lift the ark of Elohim but the Lĕwites, for יהוה
has chosen them to lift the ark of Elohim and to serve Him forever.” 
1Chron
15:3  And Dawiḏ assembled all Yisra’ĕl
at Yerushalayim, to bring up the ark of יהוה to its
place, which he had prepared for it. 
1Chron
15:4  And Dawiḏ gathered the
children of Aharon and the Lĕwites; 
1Chron
15:5  of the sons of Qehath: Uri’ĕl
the chief, and one hundred and twenty of his brothers; 
1Chron
15:6  of the sons of Merari: Asayah the
chief, and two hundred and twenty of his brothers; 
1Chron
15:7  of the sons of Gĕreshom: Yo’ĕl
the chief, and one hundred and thirty of his brothers; 
1Chron
15:8  of the sons of Elitsaphan: Shemayah
the chief, and two hundred of his brothers; 
1Chron
15:9  of the sons of Ḥeḇron:
Eli’ĕl the chief, and eighty of his brothers; 
1Chron
15:10  of the sons of Uzzi’ĕl:
Amminaḏaḇ the chief, and one hundred and twelve of his brothers. 
1Chron
15:11  And Dawiḏ called for Tsaḏoq
and Eḇyathar the priests, and for the Lĕwites, for Uri’ĕl,
Asayah, and Yo’ĕl, Shemayah, and Eli’ĕl, and Amminaḏaḇ, 
1Chron
15:12  and said to them, “You are the
heads of the fathers’ houses of the Lĕwites.
Set yourselves apart, you and your brothers, then you shall bring up the ark of
יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl to the place I have
prepared for it. 
1Chron
15:13  “Because you did not do it the
first time, יהוה our Elohim broke out against us,
because we did not ask Him about the right-ruling.” 
1Chron
15:14  So the priests and the Lĕwites
set themselves apart, to bring up the ark of יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl. 
1Chron
15:15  And the children of the Lĕwites
bore the ark of Elohim on their shoulders, by its poles, as Mosheh had
commanded according to the word of יהוה. 
1Chron
15:16  And Dawiḏ spoke to the
leaders of the Lĕwites to appoint their brothers the singers with
instruments of song, harps, and lyres, and cymbals, to lift up the voice with
joy. 
1Chron
15:17  And the Lĕwites appointed Hĕman
son of Yo’ĕl, and of his brothers, Asaph son of Bereḵyahu; and of
their brothers, the sons of Merari, Ĕythan son of Qushayahu; 
1Chron
15:18  and with them their brothers of
the second rank: Zeḵaryahu, Bĕn, and Ya‛azi’ĕl, and
Shemiramoth, and Yeḥi’ĕl, and Unni, Eliyaḇ, and Benayahu, and
Ma‛asĕyahu, and Mattithyahu, and Eliphelĕhu, and Miqnĕyahu,
and Oḇĕḏ-Eḏom, and Ye‛i’ĕl, the gatekeepers; 
1Chron
15:19  and the singers Hĕman, Asaph,
and Ĕythan, were to sound the cymbals of bronze; 
1Chron
15:20  and Zeḵaryah, and Azi’ĕl,
and Shemiramoth, and Yeḥi’ĕl, and Unni, and Eliyaḇ, and Ma‛asĕyahu,
and Benayahu, with harps according to Alamoth; 
1Chron
15:21  and Mattithyahu, and Eliphelĕhu,
and Miqnĕyahu, and Oḇĕḏ-Eḏom, and Ye‛i’ĕl,
and Azazyahu, to lead with lyres on the Sheminith; 
1Chron
15:22  and Kenanyahu, leader of the Lĕwites,
in the song, because he was skilled; 
1Chron
15:23  and Bereḵyah and Elqanah
were doorkeepers for the ark; 
1Chron
15:24  and Sheḇanyahu, and
Yoshaphat, and Nethanĕ’l, and Amasai, and Zeḵaryahu, and Benayahu,
and Eli‛ezer, the priests, were to blow the trumpets before the ark of
Elohim. And Oḇĕḏ-Eḏom and Yeḥiyah, were
doorkeepers for the ark. 
1Chron
15:25  And it was Dawiḏ and the
elders of Yisra’ĕl, and the commanders over thousands, who went to bring
up the ark of the covenant of יהוה from the house of Oḇĕḏ-Eḏom
with joy. 
1Chron
15:26  And it came to be, when Elohim
helped the Lĕwites who bore the ark of the covenant of יהוה,
that they offered seven bulls and seven rams. 
1Chron
15:27  And Dawiḏ was dressed in a
robe of fine linen, as were all the Lĕwites who bore the ark, the singers,
and Kenanyah the leader of the service with the singers. And Dawiḏ wore a
linen shoulder garment. 
1Chron
15:28  So all Yisra’ĕl brought up
the ark of the covenant of יהוה with shouting and with
the sound of the horn, with trumpets and with cymbals, sounding with harps and
lyres. 
1Chron
15:29  And it came to be, as the ark of
the covenant of יהוה came to the City of Dawiḏ,
that Miḵal the daughter of Sha’ul, looking through a window, saw
Sovereign Dawiḏ dancing and playing. And she despised him in her heart. 
1Chron
16:1  And they brought the ark of Elohim,
and set it in the midst of the Tent that Dawiḏ had pitched for it. And
they brought burnt offerings and peace offerings before Elohim. 
1Chron
16:2  And when Dawiḏ had made an
end of offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the
people in the Name of יהוה, 
1Chron
16:3  and gave a portion to everyone of
Yisra’ĕl, both man and woman, to everyone a loaf of bread, a measure, and
a cake of raisins. 
1Chron
16:4  And he appointed some of the Lĕwites
to serve before the ark of יהוה, to bring to
remembrance, and to thank, and to praise יהוה Elohim of
Yisra’ĕl: 
1Chron
16:5  Asaph the chief, and his second Zeḵaryah,
Ye‛i’ĕl, and Shemiramoth, and Yeḥi’ĕl, and Mattithyah,
and Eliyaḇ, and Benayahu, and Oḇĕḏ-Eḏom, and Ye‛i’ĕl,
with harps and lyres, but Asaph was sounding with cymbals; 
1Chron
16:6  and Benayahu and Yaḥazi’ĕl
the priests continually blew the trumpets before the ark of the covenant of
Elohim. 
1Chron
16:7  And on that day Dawiḏ first
gave thanks to יהוה by the hand of Asaph and his
brothers: 
1Chron
16:8  Give thanks to יהוה,
call upon His Name, Make known His deeds among the peoples!
1Chron
16:9  Sing to Him, sing praise to Him,
Speak of all His wonders!
1Chron
16:10  Boast in His set-apart Name, Let
the hearts of those seeking יהוה rejoice!
1Chron
16:11  Seek יהוה
and His strength, Seek His face continually!
1Chron
16:12  Remember His wonders which He has
done, His signs and the right-rulings of His mouth,
1Chron
16:13  O seed of Yisra’ĕl, His
servant; O children of Ya‛aqoḇ, His chosen ones!
1Chron
16:14  He is יהוה
our Elohim, His right-rulings are in all the earth.
1Chron
16:15  Remember His covenant forever, The
Word He commanded for a thousand generations,
1Chron
16:16  Which He made with Aḇraham,
And His oath to Yitsḥaq,
1Chron
16:17  And He established it to Ya‛aqoḇ
for a law, To Yisra’ĕl as an everlasting covenant,
1Chron
16:18  Saying, “To you I give the land of
Kena‛an, The portion of your inheritance,”
1Chron
16:19  When you were but few in number,
Few indeed, and sojourners in it.
1Chron
16:20  And they went up and down, From
one nation to another, And from one reign to another people.
1Chron
16:21  He allowed no one to oppress them,
And He reproved sovereigns for their sakes, saying:
1Chron
16:22  “Do not touch My anointed ones,
And do My prophets no evil.”
1Chron
16:23  Sing to יהוה,
all the earth; Proclaim His deliverance from day to day.
1Chron
16:24  Declare His esteem among the
nations, His wonders among all peoples.
1Chron
16:25  For great is יהוה
and greatly to be praised; And He is to be feared above all mighty ones.
1Chron
16:26  For all the mighty ones of the
peoples are matters of naught, But יהוה made the
heavens.
1Chron
16:27  Excellency and splendour are
before Him, Strength and gladness are in His place.
1Chron
16:28  Ascribe to יהוה,
O clans of the peoples, Ascribe to יהוה esteem and
strength.
1Chron
16:29  Ascribe to יהוה
the esteem of His Name; Bring an offering, and come before Him; Bow yourself to
יהוה In the splendour of set-apartness!
1Chron
16:30  Tremble before Him, all the earth.
The world also is firmly established, immovable.
1Chron
16:31  Let the heavens rejoice, and let
the earth be glad; And let them say among the nations, “ יהוה
shall reign.”
1Chron
16:32  Let the sea roar, and all that
fills it; Let the field rejoice, and all that is in it.
1Chron
16:33  Let the trees of the forest then
sing before יהוה, For He shall come to judge the earth.
1Chron
16:34  Give thanks to יהוה,
for He is good, For His kindness is everlasting!
1Chron
16:35  And say, “Save us, O Elohim of our
deliverance; And gather us together, And deliver us from the gentiles, To give
thanks to Your set-apart Name, And boast in Your praise.”
1Chron
16:36  Blessed be יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl From everlasting to everlasting! And all the people
said, “Amĕn!” and praised יהוה.
1Chron
16:37  So he left Asaph and his brothers
there before the ark of the covenant of יהוה to perform
regular service before the ark, as each day required; 
1Chron
16:38  also, Oḇĕḏ-Eḏom
with his sixty-eight brothers, including Oḇĕḏ-Eḏom son
of Yeḏuthun, and Ḥosah, to be gatekeepers; 
1Chron
16:39  and Tsaḏoq the priest and
his brothers the priests, before the Dwelling Place of יהוה
at the high place that was at Giḇ‛on, 
1Chron
16:40  to offer burnt offerings to יהוה
on the altar of burnt offering regularly morning and evening, and to do
according to all that is written in the Torah of יהוה
which He commanded Yisra’ĕl; 
1Chron
16:41  and with them Hĕman and Yeḏuthun
and the rest who were chosen, who were designated by name, to give thanks to יהוה,
because His kindness is everlasting; 
1Chron
16:42  and with them Hĕman and Yeḏuthun,
to sound aloud with trumpets and cymbals and instruments for the songs of
Elohim, and the sons of Yeḏuthun for the gate. 
1Chron
16:43  And all the people went, each one
to his house, and Dawiḏ returned to bless his house. 
1Chron
17:1  And it came to be, when Dawiḏ
was dwelling in his house, that Dawiḏ said to Nathan the prophet, “See, I
am dwelling in a house of cedar, but the ark of the covenant of יהוה
is under curtains.” 
1Chron
17:2  And Nathan said to Dawiḏ, “Do
all that is in your heart, for Elohim is with you.” 
1Chron
17:3  And it came to be that night that
the word of Elohim came to Nathan, saying, 
1Chron
17:4  “Go, and you shall say to My
servant Dawiḏ, ‘Thus said יהוה, “You do not build
Me a house to dwell in. 
1Chron
17:5  “For I have not dwelt in a house
since the time that I brought up Yisra’ĕl, even to this day, but have gone
from tent to tent, and from one
Dwelling Place to another. 
1Chron
17:6  “Wherever I have moved about with
all Yisra’ĕl, have I ever spoken a word to any of the rulers of Yisra’ĕl,
whom I commanded to shepherd My people, saying, ‘Why have you not built Me a
house of cedar?’ ” ’ 
1Chron
17:7  “And now, say this to My servant
Dawiḏ, ‘Thus said יהוה of hosts, “I took you from
the sheepfold, from following the sheep, to be ruler over My people Yisra’ĕl.

1Chron
17:8  “And I have been with you wherever
you have gone, and have cut off all your enemies from before you, and have made
you a name like the name of the great men who are on the earth. 
1Chron
17:9  “And I shall prepare a place for My
people Yisra’ĕl and plant them, and they shall dwell in a place of their
own and move no more, nor shall the sons of wickedness oppress them any more,
as at the first,
1Chron
17:10  since the time that I commanded
rulers to be over My people Yisra’ĕl, and I have humbled all your enemies.
And I declared to you that יהוה does build you a house.

1Chron
17:11  “And it shall be, when your days
are filled to go to be with your fathers, that I shall raise up your seed after
you, who is of your sons. And I shall establish his reign. 
1Chron
17:12  “He does build Me a house, and I
shall establish his throne forever. 
1Chron
17:13  “I am to be his Father, and he is
to be My son. And My kindness I do not turn away from him, as I took it from
him who was before you. 
1Chron
17:14  “And I shall establish him in My
house and in My reign forever, and let his throne be established forever.” ’ ” 
1Chron
17:15  According to all these words and
according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak to Dawiḏ. 
1Chron
17:16  And Sovereign Dawiḏ came in
and sat before יהוה, and said, “Who am I, O יהוה
Elohim? And what is my house, that You have brought me this far? 
1Chron
17:17  “And this was a small matter in
Your eyes, O Elohim, but You have spoken of Your servant’s house for a great
while to come, and have looked upon me as though I were an exalted man , O יהוה
Elohim. 
1Chron
17:18  “What more could Dawiḏ add
to You for the esteem of Your servant? For You know Your servant. 
1Chron
17:19  “O יהוה,
for Your servant’s sake, and according to Your own heart, You have done all
this greatness, in making known all these great matters. 
1Chron
17:20  “O יהוה,
there is none like You, nor is there any Elohim besides You, according to all
that we have heard with our ears. 
1Chron
17:21  “And who is like Your people Yisra’ĕl,
the one nation on the earth whom Elohim went to redeem for Himself as a people;
to make for Yourself a great and awesome Name, by driving out nations from
before Your people whom You redeemed from Mitsrayim? 
1Chron
17:22  “For You appointed Your people
Yisra’ĕl to be Your own people forever. And You, יהוה,
have become their Elohim. 
1Chron
17:23  “And now, O יהוה,
the word which You have spoken concerning Your servant and concerning his
house, let it stand fast forever, and do as You have said. 
1Chron
17:24  “So let it stand fast, and Your
Name be great forever, saying, ‘ יהוה of hosts, Elohim
of Yisra’ĕl, is Elohim to Yisra’ĕl. And let the house of Your servant
Dawiḏ be established before You.’ 
1Chron
17:25  “For You, O my Elohim, have
revealed to Your servant to build a house for him. Therefore Your servant has
found courage to pray before You. 
1Chron
17:26  “And now, יהוה,
You are Elohim, and have promised this goodness to Your servant. 
1Chron
17:27  “And now, You have been pleased to
bless the house of Your servant to be before You forever. For You have blessed
it, O יהוה, and it is blessed forever.” 
1Chron
18:1  And after this it came to be that
Dawiḏ smote the Philistines, and humbled them, and took Gath and its
towns from the hand of the Philistines. 
1Chron
18:2  And he smote the Mo’aḇites,
and the Mo’aḇites became Dawiḏ’s servants, and brought presents. 
1Chron
18:3  And Dawiḏ smote Haḏaḏezer
sovereign of Tsoḇah as far as Ḥamath, as he went to establish his
power by the River Euphrates. 
1Chron
18:4  And Dawiḏ took from him one
thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand foot
soldiers. And Dawiḏ also hamstrung all the chariot horses, but left of them for one hundred chariots. 
1Chron
18:5  And when Aram of Darmeseq came to
help Haḏaḏezer sovereign of Tsoḇah, Dawiḏ smote
twenty-two thousand of Aram, 
1Chron
18:6  and Dawiḏ stationed men in Aram of Darmeseq, and the
Arameans became Dawiḏ’s servants, and brought presents. And יהוה
saved Dawiḏ wherever he went. 
1Chron
18:7  And Dawiḏ took the shields of
gold that were on the servants of Haḏaḏezer, and brought them to
Yerushalayim. 
1Chron
18:8  And from Tiḇḥath and
from Kun, cities of Haḏaḏezer, Dawiḏ brought a large amount
of bronze, with which Shelomoh made the bronze Sea, and the columns, and the
vessels of bronze. 
1Chron
18:9  And when To‛u sovereign of Ḥamath
heard that Dawiḏ had smitten all the army of Haḏaḏezer
sovereign of Tsoḇah, 
1Chron
18:10  he sent Haḏoram his son to
Sovereign Dawiḏ, to ask peace of him and bless him, because he had fought
against Haḏaḏezer and smote him – because Haḏaḏezer had
been fighting against To‛u – with all kinds of objects of gold, and
silver, and bronze. 
1Chron
18:11  Sovereign Dawiḏ also set
these apart to יהוה, along with the silver and gold
that he had brought from all these nations, from Eḏom, and from Mo’aḇ,
and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalĕq.

1Chron
18:12  And Aḇishai son of Tseruyah
smote eighteen thousand Eḏomites in the Valley of Salt, 
1Chron
18:13  and he put watch-posts in Eḏom,
and all the Eḏomites became Dawiḏ’s servants. And יהוה
saved Dawiḏ wherever he went. 
1Chron
18:14  So Dawiḏ reigned over all
Yisra’ĕl, and he was doing right-ruling and righteousness to all his
people. 
1Chron
18:15  And Yo’aḇ son of Tseruyah
was over the army, and Yehoshaphat son of Aḥiluḏ was recorder, 
1Chron
18:16  and Tsaḏoq son of
Aḥituḇ and Aḇimeleḵ son of Eḇyathar were the
priests, and Shawsha was the scribe, 
1Chron
18:17  and Benayahu son of Yehoyaḏa
was over the Kerĕthites and the Pelĕthites. And the sons of Dawiḏ
were chiefs at the sovereign’s side. 
1Chron
19:1  And after this it came to be that
Naḥash the sovereign of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned
in his place. 
1Chron
19:2  And Dawiḏ said, “Let me show
kindness to Ḥanun son of Naḥash, because his father showed kindness
to me.” So Dawiḏ sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father.
And the servants of Dawiḏ came to Ḥanun in the land of the children
of Ammon to comfort him. 
1Chron
19:3  And the chiefs of the children of
Ammon said to Ḥanun, “Is Dawiḏ esteeming your father, in your eyes,
because he has sent comforters to you? Have his servants not come to you to
search and to overthrow and to spy out the land?” 
1Chron
19:4  So Ḥanun took Dawiḏ’s
servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the middle, at their
buttocks, and sent them away. 
1Chron
19:5  And when some went and informed Dawiḏ about the men, he sent to meet
them, because the men were greatly ashamed. And the sovereign said, “Remain at
Yeriḥo until your beards have grown, then return.” 
1Chron
19:6  And when the children of Ammon saw
that they had made themselves a stench to Dawiḏ, Ḥanun and the
children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire chariots and
horsemen from Aram-Naharayim, and from Aram-Ma‛aḵah, and from Tsoḇah.

1Chron
19:7  So they hired for themselves
thirty-two thousand chariots, with the sovereign of Ma‛aḵah and his
people, who came and encamped before Mĕyḏeḇa. And the children
of Ammon had gathered from their cities, and came to battle. 
1Chron
19:8  And when Dawiḏ heard, he sent
Yo’aḇ and the entire army of the mighty men, 
1Chron
19:9  and the children of Ammon came out
and put themselves in battle array before the gate of the city, and the
sovereigns who had come were by themselves in the field. 
1Chron
19:10  And when Yo’aḇ saw that the
battle had been set against him before and behind, he chose some of the choice
ones of Yisra’ĕl, and put them in battle array to meet Aram. 
1Chron
19:11  And the rest of the people he put
under the command of Aḇishai his brother, and they set themselves in
battle array to meet the children of Ammon. 
1Chron
19:12  And he said, “If Aram is too
strong for me, then you shall help me; but if the children of Ammon are too
strong for you, then I shall help you. 
1Chron
19:13  “Be strong, and let us show
strength for our people and for the cities of our Elohim, and let יהוה
do what is good in His eyes.” 
1Chron
19:14  And Yo’aḇ drew near, and the
people with him, to battle against Aram, and they fled before him. 
1Chron
19:15  And when the children of Ammon saw
that the Arameans were fleeing, they also fled before Aḇishai his
brother, and went into the city. And Yo’aḇ came to Yerushalayim. 
1Chron
19:16  And when Aram saw that they had
been smitten before Yisra’ĕl, they sent messengers and brought the
Arameans who were beyond the River, and Shophaḵ the commander of Haḏaḏezer’s
army went before them. 
1Chron
19:17  And it was reported to Dawiḏ,
and he gathered all Yisra’ĕl, and passed over the Yardĕn and came
upon them, and set up in battle array against them. And Dawiḏ set up in
battle array against Aram, and they fought with him. 
1Chron
19:18  And Aram fled before Yisra’ĕl,
and Dawiḏ slew seven thousand charioteers and forty thousand foot
soldiers of the Arameans, and smote Shophaḵ the commander of the army. 
1Chron
19:19  And the servants of Haḏaḏezer
saw that they were smitten by Yisra’ĕl, and they made peace with Dawiḏ
and became his servants. And the Arameans would not help the children of Ammon
any more. 
1Chron
20:1  And it came to be at the turn of
the year, at the time sovereigns go out to
battle, that Yo’aḇ led out the power of the army and destroyed the
land of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But Dawiḏ
remained at Yerushalayim. And Yo’aḇ smote Rabbah and overthrew it. 
1Chron
20:2  And Dawiḏ took their
sovereign’s crown from his head, and found it weighed a talent of gold, and
there were precious stones in it. And it was set on Dawiḏ’s head. And he
also brought out the spoil of the city, a very great amount. 
1Chron
20:3  And he brought out the people who
were in it, and put them to work with saws, and with iron picks, and with axes.
And thus Dawiḏ did to all the cities of the children of Ammon. Then Dawiḏ
and all the people returned to Yerushalayim. 
1Chron
20:4  And afterward it came to be that
fighting broke out at Gezer with the Philistines. Then Sibbeḵai the Ḥushathite
smote Sippai of the sons of the giant, and they were humbled. 
1Chron
20:5  And there was fighting again with
the Philistines, and Elḥanan son of Ya’ir smote Laḥmi the brother
of Golyath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam. 
1Chron
20:6  And there was fighting again at
Gath, where there was a man of great size, with twenty-four fingers and toes,
six and six. And he too was born to the giant. 
1Chron
20:7  And he reproached Yisra’ĕl,
and Yehonathan son of Shim‛a, Dawiḏ’s brother, smote him. 
1Chron
20:8  These were born to the giant in
Gath, and they fell by the hand of Dawiḏ and by the hand of his servants.

1Chron
21:1  And Satan stood up against Yisra’ĕl,
and moved Dawiḏ to number Yisra’ĕl. 
1Chron
21:2  And Dawiḏ said to Yo’aḇ
and to the rulers of the people, “Go, number Yisra’ĕl from Be’ĕrsheḇa
to Dan, and bring the number of them to me so that I know it.” 
1Chron
21:3  And Yo’aḇ answered, “ יהוה
does add to His people a hundred times more than they are. But, my master the
sovereign, are they not all my master’s servants? Why does my master seek to do
this? Why should he be a cause of guilt in Yisra’ĕl?” 
1Chron
21:4  But the sovereign’s word prevailed
against Yo’aḇ. And Yo’aḇ left and went throughout all Yisra’ĕl
and came to Yerushalayim. 
1Chron
21:5  And Yo’aḇ gave the sum of the
number of the people to Dawiḏ. And all Yisra’ĕl had one million one
hundred thousand men who drew the sword, and Yehuḏah had four hundred and
seventy thousand men who drew the sword. 
1Chron
21:6  But he did not number Lĕwi and
Binyamin among them, for the sovereign’s word was loathsome to Yo’aḇ. 
1Chron
21:7  And it was evil in the eyes of Elohim,
concerning this matter, and He smote Yisra’ĕl. 
1Chron
21:8  Then Dawiḏ said to Elohim, “I
have sinned greatly, because I have done this matter. But now, I pray, take
away the crookedness of Your servant, for I have done very foolishly.” 
1Chron
21:9  And יהוה
spoke to Gaḏ, Dawiḏ’s seer, saying, 
1Chron
21:10  “Go, and you shall speak to Dawiḏ,
saying, ‘Thus said יהוה, “I hold three options before you – choose one of them
for yourself, and I do it to you.” ’ ” 
1Chron
21:11  So Gaḏ came to Dawiḏ
and said to him, “Thus said יהוה, ‘Choose for yourself 
1Chron
21:12  either three years of scarcity of
food, or three months to be defeated by your foes with the sword of your
enemies overtaking you, or else for three days the sword of יהוה,
even the plague in the land, with the messenger of יהוה
destroying throughout all the borders of Yisra’ĕl.’ And now consider what
answer I am to return to Him who sent me.” 
1Chron
21:13  And Dawiḏ said to Gaḏ,
“I am in great trouble. Please let me fall into the hand of יהוה,
for His compassion is very great, but do not let me fall into the hand of man.”

1Chron
21:14  And יהוה
sent a plague upon Yisra’ĕl, and seventy thousand men of Yisra’ĕl
fell. 
1Chron
21:15  And Elohim sent a messenger to
Yerushalayim to destroy it. And as he was destroying, יהוה
saw, and relented about the evil, and said to the messenger who was destroying,
“Enough! Now stop your hand.” And the messenger of יהוה
was standing by the threshing-floor of Ornan the Yeḇusite. 
1Chron
21:16  And Dawiḏ lifted his eyes
and saw the messenger of יהוה standing between earth
and the heavens, having in his hand a drawn sword stretched out over
Yerushalayim. And Dawiḏ and the elders, wrapped in sackcloth, fell on
their faces. 
1Chron
21:17  And Dawiḏ said to Elohim, “Was
it not I who commanded the people to be numbered? I am the one who has sinned
and done evil indeed. But these, the sheep, what have they done? Let Your hand,
I pray, O יהוה my Elohim, be against me and my father’s
house, but not against Your people, to be plagued.” 
1Chron
21:18  And the messenger of יהוה
commanded Gaḏ to say to Dawiḏ that Dawiḏ should go up to
raise an altar to יהוה on the threshing-floor of Ornan
the Yeḇusite. 
1Chron
21:19  So Dawiḏ went up at the word
of Gaḏ, which he had spoken in the Name of יהוה. 
1Chron
21:20  And Ornan turned and saw the
messenger. And his four sons with him hid themselves, and Ornan was threshing
wheat. 
1Chron
21:21  And Dawiḏ came to Ornan, and
Ornan looked and saw Dawiḏ, and he went out from the threshing-floor, and
bowed down to Dawiḏ with his face to the ground. 
1Chron
21:22  And Dawiḏ said to Ornan, “Give
me the site of the threshing-floor, so that I build an altar to יהוה
on it. Give it to me at the complete price, so that the plague is restrained
from the people.” 
1Chron
21:23  And Ornan said to Dawiḏ, “Take
it for yourself, and let my master the sovereign do what is good in his eyes.
See, I shall give you the cattle for burnt offerings, the threshing implements
for wood, and the wheat for the grain offering. I give it all.” 
1Chron
21:24  And Sovereign Dawiḏ said to
Ornan, “No, but I shall certainly buy it at the complete price, for I do not
take what is yours for יהוה, nor offer a burnt offering
without cost.” 
1Chron
21:25  And Dawiḏ gave Ornan six
hundred sheqels of gold by weight for the place. 
1Chron
21:26  And Dawiḏ built there an
altar to יהוה, and offered burnt offerings and peace
offerings, and called on יהוה. And He answered him from
the heavens by fire on the altar of burnt offering. 
1Chron
21:27  Then יהוה
commanded the messenger, and he returned his sword to its sheath. 
1Chron
21:28  At that time, when Dawiḏ saw
that יהוה had answered him on the threshing-floor of
Ornan the Yeḇusite, he slaughtered there, 
1Chron
21:29  for the Dwelling Place of יהוה
and the altar of the burnt offering, which Mosheh had made in the wilderness,
were at that time at the high place in Giḇ‛on. 
1Chron
21:30  But Dawiḏ was unable to go
before it to inquire of Elohim, for he was afraid of the sword of the messenger
of יהוה. 
1Chron
22:1  Dawiḏ then said, “This is the
House of יהוה Elohim, and this is the altar of burnt
offering for Yisra’ĕl.” 
1Chron
22:2  And Dawiḏ commanded to gather
the foreigners who were in the land of Yisra’ĕl. And he appointed
stonemasons to cut hewn stones to build the House of Elohim. 
1Chron
22:3  And Dawiḏ prepared large
quantities of iron for the nails of the doors of the gates and for the clamps,
and more bronze than could be weighed, 
1Chron
22:4  and cedar trees beyond number, for
the Tsiḏonians and those from Tsor brought much cedar wood to Dawiḏ.

1Chron
22:5  And Dawiḏ said, “Shelomoh my
son is young and tender, and the house that is to be built for יהוה
is to be exceedingly great, for a splendid Name, to all the lands. Please, let
me make preparation for it.” So Dawiḏ made extensive preparations before
his death. 
1Chron
22:6  He also called for his son
Shelomoh, and commanded him to build a house for יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl. 
1Chron
22:7  And Dawiḏ said to Shelomoh, “My
son, as for me, it has been in my heart to build a house to the Name of יהוה
my Elohim, 
1Chron
22:8  but the word of יהוה
came to me, saying, ‘You have shed much blood and have fought great battles.
You do not build a house for My Name, because you have shed much blood on the
earth in My presence. 
1Chron
22:9  ‘See, a son is to be born to you,
who is a man of rest. And I shall give him rest from all his enemies all
around, for Shelomoh is his name, and peace and rest I give to Yisra’ĕl in
his days. 
1Chron
22:10  ‘He does build a house for My
Name, and he is to be My son, and I am to be his Father. And I shall establish
the throne of his reign over Yisra’ĕl forever.’ 
1Chron
22:11  “Now, my son, יהוה
be with you, then you shall prosper and build the House of יהוה
your Elohim, as He has said to you. 
1Chron
22:12  “Only, let יהוה
give you wisdom and understanding, and command you concerning Yisra’ĕl, so
that you guard the Torah of יהוה your Elohim, 
1Chron
22:13  then you shall prosper, if you
guard to do the laws and right-rulings with which יהוה
commanded Mosheh concerning Yisra’ĕl. Be strong and brave, do not fear nor
be discouraged. 
1Chron
22:14  “See, in my affliction I have
prepared for the House of יהוה one hundred thousand
talents of gold and one million talents of silver, and bronze and iron beyond
measure, for it is plenty. And I have prepared timber and stone, and you shall
add to them. 
1Chron
22:15  “And with you there are many
workmen: hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all types of skilled men
for every kind of work. 
1Chron
22:16  “Of gold and silver and bronze and
iron there is no limit. Rise up and do, and יהוה is
with you.” 
1Chron
22:17  And Dawiḏ commanded all the
rulers of Yisra’ĕl to help Shelomoh his son, saying, 
1Chron
22:18  “Is not יהוה
your Elohim with you? And has He not given you rest all around? For He has
given the inhabitants of the land into my hand, and the land has been subdued
before יהוה and before His people. 
1Chron
22:19  “Now, give your heart and your being
to seek יהוה your Elohim. And rise up and build the
set-apart place of יהוה Elohim, to bring the ark of the
covenant of יהוה and the set-apart vessels of Elohim
into the house that is to be built for the Name of יהוה.”
1Chron
23:1  And Dawiḏ was old and
satisfied with days, and he made his son Shelomoh to reign over Yisra’ĕl, 
1Chron
23:2  and he gathered all the rulers of
Yisra’ĕl, with the priests and the Lĕwites. 
1Chron
23:3  And the Lĕwites were numbered
from the age of thirty years and above. And their number, head by head, was
thirty-eight thousand males. 
1Chron
23:4  Of these, twenty-four thousand were
to oversee the work of the House of יהוה, and six
thousand were officers and judges, 
1Chron
23:5  and four thousand were gatekeepers,
and four thousand to give praise to יהוה, “which I made
for giving praise.” 
1Chron
23:6  And Dawiḏ divided them into
divisions, of the sons of Lĕwi: of Gĕrshon, Qehath, and Merari. 
1Chron
23:7  Of the Gĕrshonites: La‛dan
and Shim‛i. 
1Chron
23:8  The sons of La‛dan:
Yeḥi’ĕl the head, then Zĕtham and Yo’ĕl, three. 
1Chron
23:9  The sons of Shim‛i:
Shelomith, and Ḥazi’ĕl, and Haran, three. These were the heads of
the fathers’ houses of La‛dan. 
1Chron
23:10  And the sons of Shim‛i:
Yaḥath, Zina, and Ye‛ush, and Beri‛ah. These were the four
sons of Shim‛i. 
1Chron
23:11  And Yaḥath was the head and
Zizah the second. But Ye‛ush and Beri‛ah did not have many sons, so
they were reckoned as one father’s house. 
1Chron
23:12  The sons of Qehath: Amram,
Yitshar, Ḥeḇron, and Uzzi’ĕl, four. 
1Chron
23:13  The sons of Amram: Aharon and
Mosheh. And Aharon was set apart, he and his sons forever, that he should set
apart the most set-apart, to burn incense before יהוה,
to serve Him, and to give the blessing in His Name forever. 
1Chron
23:14  Now Mosheh, the man of Elohim, his
sons were named after the tribe of Lĕwi. 
1Chron
23:15  The sons of Mosheh: Gĕreshom
and Eli‛ezer. 
1Chron
23:16  The sons of Gĕreshom: Sheḇu’ĕl
was the head. 
1Chron
23:17  And the sons of Eli‛ezer:
Reḥaḇyah was the head. And Eli‛ezer had no other sons, but
the sons of Reḥaḇyah were very many. 
1Chron
23:18  The sons of Yitshar: Shelomith was
the head. 
1Chron
23:19  The sons of Ḥeḇron:
Yeriyahu was the head, Amaryah the second, Yaḥazi’ĕl the third, and
Yeqam‛am the fourth. 
1Chron
23:20  The sons of Uzzi’ĕl: Miḵah
was the head and Yishshiyah the second. 
1Chron
23:21  The sons of Merari: Maḥli
and Mushi. The sons of Maḥli: El‛azar and Qish. 
1Chron
23:22  And El‛azar died, and had no
sons, but only daughters. And their brothers, the sons of Qish, took them. 
1Chron
23:23  The sons of Mushi: Maḥli, Ĕḏer,
and Yerĕmoth, three. 
1Chron
23:24  These were the sons of Lĕwi
by their fathers’ houses, the heads of the fathers’ houses as they were counted
head by head by the number of their names, who did the work for the service of
the House of יהוה, from the age of twenty years and
above. 
1Chron
23:25  For Dawiḏ said, “ יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl has given rest to His people, and He dwells in
Yerushalayim forever,” 
1Chron
23:26  and also of the Lĕwites, “They
shall no longer bear the Dwelling Place, or any of the vessels for its service.”

1Chron
23:27  For by the last words of Dawiḏ
the Lĕwites were numbered from twenty years old and above, 
1Chron
23:28  because their duty was to help the
sons of Aharon in the service of the House of יהוה, in
the courtyards and in the rooms, in the cleansing of all that was set-apart,
and the work of the service of the House of Elohim, 
1Chron
23:29  both with the showbread and the
fine flour for the grain offering, and with the unleavened cakes and what is
baked on the griddle, and with what is mixed and with all kinds of measures and
sizes; 
1Chron
23:30  and to stand every morning to thank
and praise יהוה, and so at evening; 
1Chron
23:31  and for all the burnt offerings to
יהוה on the Sabbaths and on the New Moons and on the
appointed times, by number according to the right-ruling upon them, continually
before יהוה ; 
1Chron
23:32  and that they should guard the
duty of the Tent of Meeting, the duty of the set-apart place, and the duty of
the sons of Aharon their brothers in the service of the House of יהוה.

1Chron
24:1  And the divisions of the sons of
Aharon: The sons of Aharon were Naḏaḇ and Aḇihu, El‛azar
and Ithamar. 
1Chron
24:2  But Naḏaḇ and Aḇihu
died before their father, and had no children, so El‛azar and Ithamar
served as priests. 
1Chron
24:3  And Dawiḏ, with Tsaḏoq
of the sons of El‛azar, and Aḥimeleḵ of the sons of Ithamar,
divided them according to their offices in their service. 
1Chron
24:4  And there were more leaders found
of the sons of El‛azar than of the sons of Ithamar. So they divided the
sons of El‛azar into sixteen heads of their fathers’ houses, and the sons
of Ithamar into eight heads of their fathers’ houses. 
1Chron
24:5  And they were divided by lot, one
group as another, for there were officials of the set-apart place and officials
of Elohim, from the sons of El‛azar and from the sons of Ithamar. 
1Chron
24:6  And the scribe, Shemayah son of
Nethanĕ’l, one of the Lĕwites, wrote them down before the sovereign,
and the rulers, and Tsaḏoq the priest, and Aḥimeleḵ son of Eḇyathar,
and the heads of the fathers’ houses of the priests and Lĕwites, one
father’s house taken for El‛azar and one for Ithamar. 
1Chron
24:7  And the first lot came forth to
Yehoyariḇ, the second to Yeḏayah, 
1Chron
24:8  the third to Ḥarim, the
fourth to Se‛orim, 
1Chron
24:9  the fifth to Malkiyah, the sixth to
Miyamin, 
1Chron
24:10  the seventh to Haqqots, the eighth
to Aḇiyah, 
1Chron
24:11  the ninth to Yĕshua, the
tenth to Sheḵanyahu, 
1Chron
24:12  the eleventh to Elyashiḇ,
the twelfth to Yaqim, 
1Chron
24:13  the thirteenth to Ḥuppah,
the fourteenth to Yesheḇ’aḇ, 
1Chron
24:14  the fifteenth to Bilgah, the
sixteenth to Immĕr, 
1Chron
24:15  the seventeenth to Ḥĕzir,
the eighteenth to Happitstsĕts, 
1Chron
24:16  the nineteenth to Pethaḥyah,
the twentieth to Yeḥezqĕl, 
1Chron
24:17  the twenty-first to Yaḵin, the
twenty-second to Gamul, 
1Chron
24:18  the twenty-third to Delayahu, the
twenty-fourth to Ma‛azyahu. 
1Chron
24:19  These were their offices in their
service for coming into the House of יהוה according to
their right-ruling by the hand of Aharon their father, as יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl had commanded him. 
1Chron
24:20  And the rest of the sons of Lĕwi:
of the sons of Amram, Shuḇa’ĕl; of the sons of Shuḇa’ĕl,
Yeḥdeyahu. 
1Chron
24:21  Concerning Reḥaḇyahu,
of the sons of Reḥaḇyahu, the head was Yishshiyah. 
1Chron
24:22  Of the Yitsharites, Shelomoth; of
the sons of Shelomoth, Yaḥath. 
1Chron
24:23  Of the sons of Ḥeḇron, Yeriyahu was
the head, Amaryahu the second, Yaḥazi’ĕl the third, and Yeqam‛am
the fourth. 
1Chron
24:24  Of the sons of Uzzi’ĕl, Miḵah;
of the sons of Miḵah, Shamir. 
1Chron
24:25  The brother of Miḵah,
Yishshiyah; of the sons of Yishshiyah, Zeḵaryahu. 
1Chron
24:26  The sons of Merari: Maḥli
and Mushi; the son of Ya‛aziyahu, Beno. 
1Chron
24:27  The sons of Merari by Ya‛aziyahu:
Beno, and Shoham, and Zakkur, and Iḇri. 
1Chron
24:28  Of Maḥli: El‛azar, who
had no sons. 
1Chron
24:29  Of Qish: the son of Qish,
Yeraḥme’ĕl. 
1Chron
24:30  And the sons of Mushi:
Maḥli, Ĕḏer, and Yerimoth. These were the sons of the Lĕwites
according to their fathers’ houses. 
1Chron
24:31  These also cast lots, they too, as
their brothers the sons of Aharon, in the presence of Sovereign Dawiḏ,
and Tsaḏoq, and Aḥimeleḵ, and the heads of the fathers’
houses of the priests and Lĕwites – the head of the fathers, as well as
his younger brothers. 
1Chron
25:1  And Dawiḏ and the commanders
of the army separated for the service some of the sons of Asaph, and of Hĕman,
and of Yeḏuthun, who should prophesy with lyres, with harps, and with
cymbals. And the number of the workmen according to their service was: 
1Chron
25:2  Of the sons of Asaph: Zakkur, and
Yosĕph, and Nethanyah, and Ashar’ĕlah, the sons of Asaph at the hands
of Asaph, who prophesied at the hands of the sovereign. 
1Chron
25:3  Of Yeḏuthun, the sons of Yeḏuthun:
Geḏalyahu, and Tseri, and Yeshayahu, Ḥashaḇyahu, and
Mattithyahu, six, under the hands of their father Yeḏuthun, who
prophesied with a lyre to give thanks and to praise יהוה.

1Chron
25:4  Of Hĕman, the sons of Hĕman:
Buqqiyahu, Mattanyahu, Uzzi’ĕl, Sheḇu’ĕl, and Yerimoth, Ḥananyah,
Ḥanani, Eliyathah, Giddalti, and Romamti-Ezer, Yoshbeqashah, Mallothi,
Hothir, Maḥaziyoth. 
1Chron
25:5  All these were the sons of Hĕman
the sovereign’s seer in the words of Elohim, to exalt his horn. For Elohim gave
Hĕman fourteen sons and three daughters. 
1Chron
25:6  All these were at the hands of
their father for song in the House of יהוה, with
cymbals, harps and lyres, for the service of the House of Elohim: Asaph, Yeḏuthun,

and in the service of the sovereign. 
1Chron
26:31  Of the Ḥeḇronites,

the fathers. In the fortieth year of the reign of Dawiḏ they were sought,
and there were found among them able men at Ya‛zĕr of Gil‛aḏ.

and matters of the sovereign.

Yeroḥam. These were the rulers of the tribes of Yisra’ĕl. 
1Chron
27:23  But Dawiḏ did not take the
number of those twenty years old and under, because יהוה
had said He would increase Yisra’ĕl like the stars of the heavens. 
1Chron
27:24  Yo’aḇ son of Tseruyah began
a census, but he did not finish, for wrath came upon Yisra’ĕl because of
this census; nor was the number recorded in the account of the annals of
Sovereign Dawiḏ. 
1Chron
27:25  And Azmaweth son of Aḏi’ĕl
was over the sovereign’s treasuries. And Yehonathan son of Uzziyahu was over

27:32  Also Yehonathan, Dawiḏ’s
uncle, was a counsellor, a wise man and a scribe. And Yeḥi’ĕl son of
Ḥaḵmoni was with the sovereign’s sons. 
1Chron
27:33  And Aḥithophel was the
sovereign’s counsellor, and Ḥushai the Arkite was the sovereign’s
companion. 
1Chron
27:34  And after Aḥithophel was
Yehoyaḏa son of Benayahu, then Eḇyathar. And the chief of the
sovereign’s army was Yo’aḇ. 
1Chron
28:1  And Dawiḏ assembled at
Yerushalayim all the rulers of Yisra’ĕl: the rulers of the tribes and the
commanders of the divisions who served the sovereign, the commanders over
thousands and commanders over hundreds, and the heads over all the property and
possessions of the sovereign and of his sons, with the officials, the mighty
men, and all the mighty brave men. 
1Chron
28:2  Then Sovereign Dawiḏ rose to
his feet and said, “Hear me, my brothers and my people: I had it in my heart to
build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of יהוה,
and for the footstool of our Elohim, and had made preparations to build it. 
1Chron
28:3  “But Elohim said to me, ‘You do not
build a house for My Name, because you have been a man of battle and have shed
blood.’ 
1Chron
28:4  “Yet יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl chose me above all the house of my father to be
sovereign over Yisra’ĕl forever, for He has chosen Yehuḏah to be the
ruler. And of the house of Yehuḏah, the house of my father, and among the
sons of my father, He was pleased with me to make me reign over all Yisra’ĕl.

1Chron
28:5  “And of all my sons – for יהוה
has given me many sons – He has chosen my son Shelomoh to sit on the throne of
the reign of יהוה over Yisra’ĕl, 
1Chron
28:6  and said to me, ‘Shelomoh your son
is the one to build My house and My courtyards, for I have chosen him to be My
son, and I Myself am a Father to him. 
1Chron
28:7  ‘And I shall establish his reign
forever, if he is strong to do My commands and My right-rulings, as it is this
day.’ 
1Chron
28:8  “And now, before the eyes of all
Yisra’ĕl, the assembly of יהוה, and in the hearing
of our Elohim, guard and seek all the commands of יהוה
your Elohim, so that you possess this good land, and leave it as an inheritance
for your children after you forever. 
1Chron
28:9  “As for you, my son Shelomoh, know
the Elohim of your father, and serve Him with a perfect heart and with a
pleasing life, for יהוה searches all hearts and
understands all the intent of the thoughts. If you do seek Him, He is found by
you; but if you forsake Him, He rejects you forever. 
1Chron
28:10  “See, now, for יהוה
has chosen you to build a house for the set-apart place. Be strong, and do it.”

1Chron
28:11  And Dawiḏ gave his son
Shelomoh the plans for the porch, and its houses, and its treasuries, and its
upper rooms, and its inner rooms, and the place of atonement; 
1Chron
28:12  and the plans for all that he had
by the Spirit, of the courtyards of the House of יהוה,
and of all the rooms all around, and of the treasuries of the House of Elohim,
and of the treasuries for the set-apart gifts;

1Chron
28:13  and for the divisions of the
priests and the Lĕwites, and for all the work of the service of the House
of יהוה, and for all the vessels of service in the
House of יהוה ; 
1Chron
28:14  even gold by weight for utensils of gold, for all utensils used
in every kind of service; for silver for all utensils of silver by weight, for
all utensils used in every kind of service; 
1Chron
28:15  and by weight for the lampstands
of gold, and their lamps of gold, by weight for each lampstand and its lamps;
and for the lampstands of silver by weight, for the lampstand and its lamps,
according to the use of each lampstand; 
1Chron
28:16  and by weight gold for the tables
of the showbread, for each table, and silver for the tables of silver; 
1Chron
28:17  and clean gold for the forks, and
the basins, and the jars of clean gold, and the golden bowls, by weight for
every bowl; and for the silver bowls, silver by weight for every bowl; 
1Chron
28:18  and refined gold by weight for the
altar of incense, and for the pattern of the chariot of the gold keruḥim,
spreading out their wings and covering over the ark of the covenant of יהוה.

1Chron
28:19  “ יהוה
made me understand all this in writing, by His hand upon me, all the works of
these plans.” 
1Chron
28:20  And Dawiḏ said to his son
Shelomoh, “Be strong and courageous, and do it. Do not fear nor be afraid, for יהוה
Elohim, my Elohim, is with you. He shall not leave you nor forsake you, until
you have completed all the work for the service of the House of יהוה.

1Chron
28:21  “And see, the divisions of the
priests and the Lĕwites for all the service of the House of Elohim, and
every volunteer of any skill is with you in all work, for every kind of
service. And the rulers and all the people are entirely at your command.” 
1Chron
29:1  And Dawiḏ the sovereign said
to all the assembly, “My son Shelomoh, the one whom Elohim has chosen, is young
and tender. And the work is great, because the palace is not for man but for יהוה
Elohim. 
1Chron
29:2  “And with all my power I have
prepared for the House of my Elohim: the gold for the gold, and the silver for
the silver, and the bronze for the bronze, the iron for the iron, and the wood
for the wood, shoham stones, and settings, and fair stones of various colours,
and all kinds of precious stones, and marble slabs – in large quantities. 
1Chron
29:3  “And also, because I delighted in
the House of my Elohim, I have treasure of gold and silver; I give for the
House of my Elohim even more than all that I have prepared for the Set-apart
House: 
1Chron
29:4  three thousand talents of gold, of
the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the
walls of the houses; 
1Chron
29:5  the gold for the gold and the
silver for the silver, and for all kinds of work to be done by the hands of
craftsmen. Who then is moved to fill his hand today for יהוה
?” 
1Chron
29:6  And the leaders of the fathers’ houses, and the leaders of the tribes of
Yisra’ĕl, and the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, with the heads
over the sovereign’s work, volunteered 
1Chron
29:7  and gave for the work of the House
of Elohim five thousand talents and ten thousand darics of gold, and ten
thousand talents of silver, and eighteen thousand talents of bronze, and one
hundred thousand talents of iron. 
1Chron
29:8  And those with whom were found
precious stones gave them to the
treasury of the House of יהוה, into the hand of
Yeḥi’ĕl the Gĕrshonite. 
1Chron
29:9  And the people rejoiced, for they
had given voluntarily, because with a perfect heart they had given voluntarily
to יהוה. And Dawiḏ the sovereign also rejoiced
greatly. 
1Chron
29:10  And Dawiḏ blessed יהוה
before all the assembly. And Dawiḏ said, “Blessed are You, יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, our Father, forever and ever. 
1Chron
29:11  “Yours, O יהוה,
is the greatness, the power and the comeliness, the pre-eminence and the
excellency, because of all that is in the heavens and in the earth. Yours is
the reign, O יהוה, and You are exalted as head above
all.
1Chron
29:12  “And the riches and the esteem
come from Your presence, and You rule over all. And in Your hand is power and
might, and in Your hand to make great and to give strength to all. 
1Chron
29:13  “And now, our Elohim, we thank You
and praise Your comely Name. 
1Chron
29:14  “But who am I, and who are my
people, that we should be able to give so voluntarily as this? For all comes
from You, and we have given to You out of Your hand. 
1Chron
29:15  “For we are sojourners and
pilgrims before You, as were all our fathers; our days on earth are as a
shadow, and without permanence. 
1Chron
29:16  “O יהוה
our Elohim, all this store that we have prepared to build You a house for Your
set-apart Name is from Your hand, and all is of You. 
1Chron
29:17  “And I know, my Elohim, that You
are trying the heart and desire uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of
my heart I have voluntarily given all these. And now with joy I have seen Your
people, who are present here to give voluntarily to You. 
1Chron
29:18  “O יהוה
Elohim of Aḇraham, Yitsḥaq, and Yisra’ĕl, our fathers, guard
this forever in the intent of the thoughts of the heart of Your people, and
prepare their heart toward You. 
1Chron
29:19  “And give my son Shelomoh a
perfect heart to guard Your commands and Your witnesses and Your laws, to do
all, and to build the palace for which I have prepared.”
1Chron
29:20  And Dawiḏ said to all the
assembly, “Now bless יהוה your Elohim.” And all the
assembly blessed יהוה Elohim of their fathers, and
bowed their heads and did obeisance to יהוה and the
sovereign. 
1Chron
29:21  And they made offerings to יהוה
and offered burnt offerings to יהוה on the next day: a
thousand bulls, a thousand rams, a thousand lambs, with their drink offerings,
and slaughterings in large numbers for all Yisra’ĕl. 
1Chron
29:22  And they ate and drank before יהוה
with great joy on that day. And they set up Shelomoh son of Dawiḏ to
reign the second time, and anointed him before יהוה to
be leader, and Tsaḏoq to be priest. 
1Chron
29:23  And Shelomoh sat on the throne of יהוה
as sovereign instead of Dawiḏ his father, and prospered; and all Yisra’ĕl
obeyed him. 
1Chron
29:24  And all the rulers and the mighty
men, and also all the sons of Sovereign Dawiḏ, submitted themselves to
Shelomoh the sovereign. 
1Chron
29:25  And יהוה
exalted Shelomoh exceedingly in the eyes of all Yisra’ĕl, and put upon him
such royal splendour as had not been on any sovereign before him in Yisra’ĕl.

1Chron
29:26  Thus Dawiḏ son of Yishai
reigned over all Yisra’ĕl. 
1Chron
29:27  And the days that he reigned over
Yisra’ĕl was forty years. He reigned seven years in Ḥeḇron,
and he reigned thirty-three years in Yerushalayim. 
1Chron
29:28  And he died in a good old age,
satisfied with days, riches and esteem. And Shelomoh his son reigned in his
place. 
1Chron
29:29  And the acts of Sovereign Dawiḏ,
first and last, see, they are written in the book of Shemu’ĕl the seer, in
the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gaḏ the seer, 
1Chron
29:30  with all his reign and his might,
and the times that passed over him, and over Yisra’ĕl, and over all the
reigns of the lands.
