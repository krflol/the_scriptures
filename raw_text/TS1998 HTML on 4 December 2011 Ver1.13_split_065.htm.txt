Timotiyos Aleph/1 Timothy
1Tim
1:1  Sha’ul, an emissary of יהושע
Messiah, according to a command of Elohim our Saviour, and of the Master יהושע
Messiah, our expectation, 
1Tim
1:2  to Timothy, a genuine child in the
belief: Favour, compassion, peace from Elohim our Father and יהושע
Messiah our Master. 
1Tim
1:3  As I appealed to you when I went
into Makedonia, to remain in Ephesos, in order to command some not to teach
differently, 
1Tim
1:4  nor to pay attention to fables and
endless genealogies, which cause disputes rather than an administration of
Elohim which is in belief. 
1Tim
1:5  Now the goal of this command is love
from a clean heart, from a good conscience and a sincere belief, 
1Tim
1:6  which some, having missed the goal, turned aside to senseless
talk, 
1Tim
1:7  wishing to be teachers of Torah,
understanding neither what they say nor concerning what they strongly affirm. 
1Tim
1:8  And we know that the Torah is good
if one uses it legitimately, 
1Tim
1:9  knowing this: that Torah is not laid
down for a righteous being, but for the lawless and unruly, for the wicked and
for sinners, for the wrong-doers and profane, for those who kill their fathers
or mothers, for murderers, 
1Tim
1:10  for those who whore, for sodomites,
for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and for whatever else that is
contrary to sound teaching, 
1Tim
1:11  according to the esteemed Good News
of the blessed Elohim which was entrusted to me. 
1Tim
1:12  And I thank Messiah יהושע
our Master who empowered me, because He counted me trustworthy, putting me into
service, 
1Tim
1:13  me, although I was formerly a
blasphemer, and a persecutor, and an insulter. But compassion was shown me
because being ignorant I did it in unbelief. 
1Tim
1:14  And the favour of our Master was
exceedingly increased, with belief and love which are in Messiah יהושע.

1Tim
1:15  Trustworthy is the word and worthy
of all acceptance, that Messiah יהושע came into
the world to save sinners, of whom I am foremost. 
1Tim
1:16  But because of this I received
compassion, so that in me first, יהושע Messiah
might display all patience, as an example to those who are going to believe on
Him for everlasting life. 
1Tim
1:17  Now to the Sovereign of the ages,
incorruptible, invisible, to Elohim who alone is wise, be respect and esteem
forever and ever. Amĕn. 
1Tim
1:18  This charge I entrust to you, son
Timothy, according to the prophecies previously made concerning you, that by
them you might wage the good campaign, 
1Tim
1:19  having belief and a good
conscience, which some have thrust aside and suffered shipwreck concerning
their belief. 
1Tim
1:20  Among these are Humenaios and
Alexander, whom I delivered to Satan, in order to be taught not to blaspheme. 
1Tim
2:1  First of all, then, I urge that
petitions, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgiving be made for all men, 
1Tim
2:2  for sovereigns and all those who are
in authority, in order that we lead a calm and peaceable life in all reverence
and seriousness. 
1Tim
2:3  For this is good and acceptable
before Elohim our Saviour, 
1Tim
2:4  who desires all men to be saved and
to come to the knowledge of the truth. 
1Tim
2:5  For there is one Elohim, and one
Mediator between Elohim and men, the Man Messiah יהושע,
1Tim
2:6  who gave Himself a ransom for all,
to be witnessed in its own seasons, 
1Tim
2:7  for which I was appointed a proclaimer
and an emissary – I am speaking the truth in Messiah and not lying – a teacher
of the gentiles in belief and truth. 
1Tim
2:8  So I resolve that the men pray
everywhere, lifting up hands that are set-apart, without wrath and disputing. 
1Tim
2:9  Likewise, that the women dress
themselves becomingly, with decency and sensibleness, not with braided hair or
gold or pearls or costly garments, 
1Tim
2:10  but with good works, which is
becoming for women undertaking worship of Elohim.
1Tim
2:11  Let a woman learn in silence, in
all subjection. 
1Tim
2:12  But I do not permit a woman to
teach or to have authority over a man, rather, to be in silence. 
1Tim
2:13  Because Aḏam was formed
first, then Ḥawwah. 
1Tim
2:14  And Aḏam was not deceived,
but the woman, having been deceived, fell into transgression. 
1Tim
2:15  But she shall be saved in
childbearing if they continue in belief, and love, and set-apartness, with
sensibleness. 
1Tim
3:1  Trustworthy is the word: If a man
longs for the position of an overseer, he desires a good work. 
1Tim
3:2  An overseer, then, should be
blameless, the husband of one wife, sober, sensible, orderly, kind to
strangers, able to teach, 
1Tim
3:3  not given to wine, no brawler, but
gentle, not quarrelsome, no lover of money, 
1Tim
3:4  one who rules his own house well,
having his children in subjection with all reverence, 
1Tim
3:5  for if a man does not know how to
rule his own house, how shall he look after the assembly of Elohim? 
1Tim
3:6  Not a new convert, lest he become
puffed up with pride and fall into the judgment of the devil. 
1Tim
3:7  And he should even have a good
witness from those who are outside, lest he fall into reproach and the snare of
the devil. 
1Tim
3:8  Likewise attendants are to be
reverent, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy for filthy
gain, 
1Tim
3:9  holding to the secret of the belief
with a clean conscience. 
1Tim
3:10  And let these also be proved first,
then let them serve, if they are unreprovable. 
1Tim
3:11  Wives in the same way: reverent,
not false accusers, sober, trustworthy in every way. 
1Tim
3:12  Let attendants be the husbands of only one wife, ruling children and their
own houses well. 
1Tim
3:13  For those who have served well as
attendants gain good standing for themselves, and much boldness in the belief
that is in Messiah יהושע. 
1Tim
3:14  I am writing you this, expecting to
come to you shortly, 
1Tim
3:15  but if I delay, that you might know
how you should behave in the House of Elohim, which is the assembly of the
living Elohim – a strong support and
foundation of the truth. 
1Tim
3:16  And, beyond all question, the
secret of reverence is great – who was revealed in the flesh, declared right in
Spirit, was seen by messengers, was proclaimed among nations, was believed on
in the world, was taken up in esteem. 
1Tim
4:1  But the Spirit distinctly says that
in latter times some shall fall away from the belief, paying attention to
misleading spirits, and teachings of demons, 
1Tim
4:2  speaking lies in hypocrisy, having
been branded on their own conscience, 
1Tim
4:3  forbidding to marry, saying to abstain from foods which
Elohim created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know
the truth. 
1Tim
4:4  Because every creature of Elohim is
good, and none is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving, 
1Tim
4:5  for it is set apart by the Word of
Elohim and prayer. 
1Tim
4:6  If you present these matters to the brothers, you shall be a
good servant of יהושע Messiah, being nourished in
the words of belief and of the good teaching which you have followed closely. 
1Tim
4:7  But refuse profane and old wives’
fables, and exercise yourself rather to reverence. 
1Tim
4:8  For bodily exercise is profitable
for a little, but reverence is profitable for all, having promise of the
present life, and of that which is to come. 
1Tim
4:9  Trustworthy is the word, and worthy
of all acceptance. 
1Tim
4:10  It is for this that we labour and
struggle, because we trust in the living Elohim, who is the Saviour of all men,
particularly of those who believe. 
1Tim
4:11  Command and teach these matters. 
1Tim
4:12  Let no one look down on your youth,
but be an example to the believers in word, in behaviour, in love, in spirit,
in belief, in cleanliness. 
1Tim
4:13  Until I come, give attention to
reading of Scripture, to
encouragement, to teaching. 
1Tim
4:14  Do not neglect the gift that is in
you, which was given to you by prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the
elderhood. 
1Tim
4:15  Practise these matters, be in them, so that your progress might be plain to all. 
1Tim
4:16  Pay attention to yourself and to
the teaching. Continue in them, for in doing this you shall save both yourself
and those who hear you. 
1Tim
5:1  Do not rebuke an older man, but
appeal to him as a father, younger ones as brothers, 
1Tim
5:2  elderly women as mothers, younger
ones as sisters, in all cleanliness. 
1Tim
5:3  Respect widows who are truly widows.

1Tim
5:4  But if any widow has children or
grandchildren, let them first learn to treat their own house reverently, and to
repay their parents. For this is good and acceptable before Elohim. 
1Tim
5:5  And she who is truly a widow, and
left alone, trusts in Elohim and continues in petitions and prayers night and
day. 
1Tim
5:6  But she who is living in luxury is
dead while she lives. 
1Tim
5:7  And command these matters, in order for them to be
blameless. 
1Tim
5:8  And if anyone does not provide for
his own, and especially for those of his household, he has denied the belief
and is worse than an unbeliever. 
1Tim
5:9  Do not enrol a widow unless she is
over sixty years of age, having been the wife of one man, 
1Tim
5:10  well reported for good works, if
she has brought up children, if she has lodged strangers, if she has washed the
feet of the set-apart ones, if she has assisted the afflicted, if she has
closely followed every good work. 
1Tim
5:11  But refuse the younger widows, for
when they become headstrong against the Messiah, they desire to marry, 
1Tim
5:12  having guilt because they set aside
their first belief. 
1Tim
5:13  Moreover, they learn to be idle,
going about from house to house, and not only idle but also gossips and
busybodies, speaking what is improper. 
1Tim
5:14  So I resolve that the younger
widows marry, bear children, manage the house, giving no occasion to the
adversary for reviling. 
1Tim
5:15  For already some have turned aside
after Satan. 
1Tim
5:16  If any believing man or woman has
widows, let such assist them, and do not let the assembly be burdened, in order
to assist those who are truly widows. 
1Tim
5:17  Let the elders who rule well be
counted worthy of double respect, especially those who labour in the word and
teaching. 
1Tim
5:18  For the Scripture says, “You shall
not muzzle an ox while it treads out the grain,” and, “The labourer is worthy
of his wages.” 
1Tim
5:19  Do not receive an accusation
against an elder except from two or three witnesses. 
1Tim
5:20  Reprove those who are sinning, in
the presence of all, so that the rest also might fear. 
1Tim
5:21  I earnestly witness before Elohim
and the Master יהושע Messiah, and the chosen
messengers, that you watch over these matters
without prejudice, doing none at all with partiality. 
1Tim
5:22  Do not lay hands on anyone hastily,
nor share in sins of others. Keep yourself clean. 
1Tim
5:23  No longer drink only water, but use
a little wine for your stomach’s sake and your frequent ailments. 
1Tim
5:24  The sins of some men are obvious,
leading on to judgment, but those of some men follow later. 
1Tim
5:25  In the same way, the good works are
obvious, while it is impossible to conceal those that are otherwise. 
1Tim
6:1  Let those who are servants under a
yoke regard their own masters worthy of all respect, lest the Name of Elohim
and His teaching be blasphemed. 
1Tim
6:2  And those who have believing
masters, let them not disregard them because they are brothers, but rather
serve them because they are believing and beloved ones, those receiving of the
good service in return. Teach and urge these matters. 
1Tim
6:3  If anyone teaches differently and
does not agree to the sound words, those of our Master יהושע
Messiah, and to the teaching which is according to reverence, 
1Tim
6:4  he is puffed up, understanding none
at all, but is sick about questionings and verbal battles from which come envy,
strife, slander, wicked suspicions, 
1Tim
6:5  worthless disputes of men of corrupt
minds and deprived of the truth, who think that reverence is a means of gain –
withdraw from such. 
1Tim
6:6  But reverence with contentment is
great gain. 
1Tim
6:7  For we brought naught into the
world, and it is impossible to take any out. 
1Tim
6:8  When we have food and covering, we
shall be satisfied with these. 
1Tim
6:9  But those wishing to be rich fall
into trial and a snare, and into many foolish and injurious lusts which plunge
men in ruin and destruction. 
1Tim
6:10  For the love of money is a root of
all kinds of evil, for which some, by longing for it, have strayed from the
belief, and pierced themselves through with many pains. 
1Tim
6:11  But you, O man of Elohim, flee from
all this, and pursue righteousness, reverence, belief, love, endurance,
meekness. 
1Tim
6:12  Fight the good fight of the belief,
lay hold on everlasting life, to which you were also called and have confessed
the good confession before many witnesses. 
1Tim
6:13  In the sight of Elohim who gives
life to all, and of Messiah יהושע who witnessed
the good confession before Pontius Pilate, I charge you: 
1Tim
6:14  that you guard the command
spotlessly, blamelessly, until the appearing of our Master יהושע
Messiah,
1Tim
6:15  which in His own seasons He shall
reveal – the blessed and only Ruler, the Sovereign of sovereigns and Master of
masters, 
1Tim
6:16  who alone has immortality, dwelling
in unapproachable light, whom no one has seen or is able to see, to whom be
respect and everlasting might. Amĕn. 
1Tim
6:17  Charge those who are rich in this
present age not to be high-minded, nor to trust in the uncertainty of riches,
but in the living Elohim, who gives us richly all for enjoyment, 
1Tim
6:18  to do good, to be rich in good
works, to be generous, ready to share,
1Tim
6:19  storing up for themselves a good
foundation for the time to come, so that they lay hold on everlasting life. 
1Tim
6:20  O Timothy! Watch over that which
has been entrusted to you, turning aside from the profane and empty babblings
and contradictions of the falsely called ‘knowledge,’ 
1Tim
6:21  which some, having professed it, have
missed the goal concerning the
belief. Favour be with you. Amĕn.
