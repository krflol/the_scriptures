Ruth
1:1  And it came to be, in the days when
the rulers ruled, that there was a scarcity of food in the land. And a man from
Bĕyth Leḥem, Yehuḏah, went to sojourn in the fields of Mo’aḇ,
he and his wife and his two sons. 
Ruth
1:2  And the name of the man was Elimeleḵ,
and the name of his wife was Na‛omi, and the names of his two sons were
Maḥlon and Kilyon – Ephrathites of Bĕyth Leḥem, Yehuḏah.
And they went to the fields of Mo’aḇ and came to be there. 
Ruth
1:3  And Elimeleḵ, husband of Na‛omi,
died. And she was left with her two sons. 
Ruth
1:4  And they took wives of the women of
Mo’aḇ, the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth. And
they dwelt there about ten years. 
Ruth
1:5  And Maḥlon and Kilyon also
died, both of them, so the woman was bereaved of her two sons and of her
husband. 
Ruth
1:6  And she rose up, with her
daughters-in-law, and returned from the fields of Mo’aḇ, for she had
heard in the fields of Mo’aḇ that יהוה had
visited His people in giving them bread. 
Ruth
1:7  And she left the place where she
was, and her two daughters-in-law with her. And they went on the way to return
to the land of Yehuḏah. 
Ruth
1:8  And Na‛omi said to her two
daughters-in-law, “Go, return each to her mother’s house. יהוה
show kindness to you, as you have shown to the dead and to me. 
Ruth
1:9  “ יהוה grant
that you find rest, each in the house of her husband.” Then she kissed them,
and they lifted up their voices and wept. 
Ruth
1:10  And they said to her, “No, we shall
go back with you to your people.” 
Ruth
1:11  But Na‛omi said, “Go back, my
daughters, why go with me? Have I still sons in my womb, that they should
become your husbands? 
Ruth
1:12  “Go back, my daughters, go your
way, for I am too old to have a husband. If I should say I have expectancy,
even if I should have a husband tonight and should also bear sons, 
Ruth
1:13  would you wait for them till they
were grown? Would you shut yourselves up, not to have a husband? No, my
daughters, for it is much more bitter for me than for you, because the hand of יהוה
has gone out against me!” 
Ruth
1:14  And they lifted up their voices and
wept again. And Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung to her. 
Ruth
1:15  And she said, “Look, your
sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her mighty ones. Go back,
follow your sister-in-law.” 
Ruth
1:16  But Ruth said, “Do not urge me to
leave you, or to go back from following after you. For wherever you go, I go;
and wherever you stop over, I stop over. Your people is my people, and your
Elohim is my Elohim.
Ruth
1:17  “Where you die, I die, and there I
shall be buried. יהוה do so to me, and more also – for
death itself parts you and me.” 
Ruth
1:18  And when she saw that she was
strengthening herself to go with her, she ceased to speak to her. 
Ruth
1:19  And both of them went until they
came to Bĕyth Leḥem. And it came to be, when they had come to Bĕyth
Leḥem, that all the city was moved because of them, and they said, “Is
this Na‛omi?” 
Ruth
1:20  And she said to them, “Do not call
me Na‛omi, call me Mara, for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with
me. 
Ruth
1:21  “I went out filled, and יהוה
has brought me back empty. Why do you call me Na‛omi, since יהוה
has witnessed against me, and the Almighty has done evil to me?” 
Ruth
1:22  Thus Na‛omi returned, and
Ruth the Mo’aḇitess her daughter-in-law with her, who returned from the
fields of Mo’aḇ, and they came to Bĕyth Leḥem at the beginning
of barley harvest. 
Ruth
2:1  And Na‛omi had a relative on
her husband’s side, a man of great wealth, of the clan of Elimeleḵ, and
his name was Bo‛az. 
Ruth
2:2  And Ruth, the Mo’aḇitess, said
to Na‛omi, “Please let me go to the field, and glean heads of grain after
him in whose eyes I find favour.” So she said to her, “Go, my daughter.” 
Ruth
2:3  And she left, and went and gleaned
in the field after the reapers. As it turned out, she came to the part of the
field belonging to Bo‛az, the near relative of Elimeleḵ. 
Ruth
2:4  And see, Bo‛az had come from Bĕyth
Leḥem, and said to the reapers, “ יהוה be with
you!” And they answered him, “ יהוה bless you!”
Ruth
2:5  And Bo‛az said to his servant
who was appointed over the reapers, “Whose young woman is this?” 
Ruth
2:6  So the servant who was appointed
over the reapers answered and said, “It is the young Mo’aḇite woman who
came back with Na‛omi from the fields of Mo’aḇ, 
Ruth
2:7  and she said, ‘Please let me glean,
and gather among the sheaves behind the reapers.’ And she came and has remained
from morning until now – she sat a little in the house.” 
Ruth
2:8  And Bo‛az said to Ruth, “You
have heard, have you not, my daughter? Do not go to glean in another field, nor
go from here, but stay close to my young women. 
Ruth
2:9  “Let your eyes be on the field which
they reap, and you shall go after them. Have I not commanded the young men not
to touch you? And when you are thirsty, go to the vessels and drink from what
the young men have drawn.” 
Ruth
2:10  And she fell on her face, bowed down
to the ground, and said to him, “Why have I found favour in your eyes, that you
should take notice of me, seeing I am a foreigner?” 
Ruth
2:11  And Bo‛az answered and said
to her, “I have been told all that you have done for your mother-in-law since
the death of your husband, and how you have left your father and your mother
and the land of your birth, and have come to a people whom you did not know
before. 
Ruth
2:12  “ יהוה
repay your work, and your reward is complete from יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, under whose wings you have come to seek refuge.” 
Ruth
2:13  And she said, “Let me find favour
in your eyes, my master, because you have comforted me, and have spoken to the
heart of your female servant, though I am not like one of your female servants.”

Ruth
2:14  And Bo‛az said to her, “Come
here at mealtime. Then you shall eat of the bread and dip your piece of bread
in the vinegar.” And she sat beside the reapers, and he passed roasted grain to
her. And she ate and was satisfied, and had left over. 
Ruth
2:15  And she rose up to glean, and Bo‛az
commanded his young men, saying, “Let her glean even among the sheaves, and do
not embarrass her. 
Ruth
2:16  “Rather, draw out from the bundles
for her, and leave it for her to glean, and do not restrain her.” 
Ruth
2:17  And she gleaned in the field until
evening, and beat out that which she had gleaned, and it was about an ĕphah
of barley. 
Ruth
2:18  And she took it up and went into
the city, and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned. And she brought out and
gave to her what she had left over after she was satisfied. 
Ruth
2:19  Then her mother-in-law asked her, “Where
have you gleaned today? And where did you work? Blessed be the one who took
notice of you.” And she told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked, and
said, “The name of the man I worked today with is Bo‛az.” 
Ruth
2:20  And Na‛omi said to her
daughter-in-law, “Blessed be he of יהוה, who has not
forsaken His kindness to the living and the dead!” And Na‛omi said to
her, “The man is a relative of ours, one of our redeemers.” 
Ruth
2:21  And Ruth the Mo’aḇitess said,
“He also said to me, ‘Stay close to my young people until they have completed
all my harvest.’ ” 
Ruth
2:22  And Na‛omi said to Ruth her
daughter-in-law, “It is good, my daughter, that you go out with his young
women, and that they do not meet you in any other field.” 
Ruth
2:23  And she stayed close by the young
women of Bo‛az to glean, till the completion of barley harvest and wheat
harvest, but she dwelt with her mother-in-law. 
Ruth
3:1  And Na‛omi her mother-in-law
said to her, “My daughter, should I not seek rest for you, so that it is well
with you? 
Ruth
3:2  “And now, is not Bo‛az, with
whose young women you have been, our relative? See, he is winnowing barley
tonight at the threshing-floor. 
Ruth
3:3  “And, you shall bathe and anoint
yourself, and put your garments on and go down to the threshing-floor. Do not
make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking. 
Ruth
3:4  “And it shall be, when he lies down,
that you shall notice the place where he lies, and shall go in and uncover his
feet, and lie down. And let him make known to you what you should do.” 
Ruth
3:5  And she said to her, “All that you
say to me, I do.” 
Ruth
3:6  And she went down to the threshing-floor
and did according to all that her mother-in-law instructed her. 
Ruth
3:7  And Bo‛az ate and drank, and
his heart was glad, and he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain.
And she came softly and uncovered his feet, and lay down. 
Ruth
3:8  And it came to be at midnight that
the man was startled, and turned himself, and saw a woman lying at his feet! 
Ruth
3:9  And he said, “Who are you?” And she
answered, “I am Ruth, your female servant. Now you shall spread your covering
over your female servant – for you are a redeemer.” 
Ruth
3:10  And he said, “Blessed are you of יהוה,
my daughter! For you have shown more kindness at the end than at the beginning,
not to go after young men, whether poor or rich. 
Ruth
3:11  “And now, my daughter, do not fear.
All that you say I do for you, for all the people of my town know that you are
a capable woman. 
Ruth
3:12  “And now, it is true that I am your
redeemer. However, there is a redeemer nearer than I. 
Ruth
3:13  “Stop over tonight, and in the morning
it shall be that if he does redeem you, good – let him do it. But if he is not
pleased to redeem you, then I shall redeem you, as יהוה
lives! Lie down until morning.” 
Ruth
3:14  And she lay at his feet until
morning, and she arose before one could recognise another. And he said, “Let it
not be known that the woman came to the threshing-floor.” 
Ruth
3:15  And he said, “Bring the shawl that
is on you and hold it.” So she held it and he measured six measures of barley, and laid it on her. And she went into the city.

Ruth
3:16  And when she came to her
mother-in-law, she said, “Is that you, my daughter?” And she explained to her
all that the man had done for her. 
Ruth
3:17  And she said, “He gave me these six
measures of barley, for he said to
me, ‘Do not go empty-handed to your mother-in-law.’ ” 
Ruth
3:18  And she said, “Wait, my daughter,
until you know how the matter falls, for the man is not going to rest until he
has completed the matter this day.” 
Ruth
4:1  And Bo‛az went up to the gate
and sat down there. And see, the redeemer of whom Bo‛az had spoken came
by. And Bo‛az said, “Turn aside, So-and-so, sit down here.” And he turned
aside and sat down. 
Ruth
4:2  And he took ten men of the elders of
the city, and said, “Sit down here.” So they sat down. 
Ruth
4:3  He then said to the redeemer, “Na‛omi,
who has come back from the fields of Mo’aḇ, sold the piece of land which
belonged to our brother Elimeleḵ. 
Ruth
4:4  “And I thought that I should
disclose it to you, saying, ‘Buy it back in the presence of the inhabitants and
the elders of my people. If you do redeem it, redeem it. But if you do not
redeem it, inform me, so that I know. For there is no one but you to redeem it,
and I am next after you.’ ” And he said, “I redeem it.” 
Ruth
4:5  And Bo‛az said, “On the day
you buy the field from the hand of Na‛omi, you shall also acquire Ruth
the Mo’aḇitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead on
his inheritance.” 
Ruth
4:6  And the redeemer said, “I am not
able to redeem it for myself, lest I ruin my own inheritance. Redeem my right
of redemption for yourself, for I am not able to redeem it.” 
Ruth
4:7  And this was formerly done in Yisra’ĕl
concerning redeeming and exchanging, to confirm every word: one man took off
his sandal and gave it to the other, and this was a witness in Yisra’ĕl. 
Ruth
4:8  So the redeemer said to Bo‛az,
“Buy it for yourself.” Then he took off his sandal. 
Ruth
4:9  And Bo‛az said to the elders
and to all the people, “You are witnesses this day that I have bought all that
was Elimeleḵ’s, and all that was Kilyon’s and Maḥlon’s, from the
hand of Na‛omi. 
Ruth
4:10  “And also, Ruth the Mo’aḇitess,
the wife of Maḥlon, I have acquired as my wife, to raise up the name of
the dead on his inheritance, so that the name of the dead should not be cut off
from among his brothers and from the gate of his place. You are witnesses
today.” 
Ruth
4:11  And all the people who were at the
gate, and the elders, said, “Witnesses! יהוה make the
woman who is coming to your house as Raḥĕl and as Lĕ’ah, the
two who built the house of Yisra’ĕl. And prove your worth in Ephrathah and
proclaim the Name in Bĕyth Leḥem. 
Ruth
4:12  “And let your house be like the
house of Perets, whom Tamar bore to Yehuḏah, of the seed which יהוה
does give you from this young woman.” 
Ruth
4:13  And Bo‛az took Ruth and she
became his wife. And he went in to her, and יהוה
granted her conception, and she bore a son. 
Ruth
4:14  And the women said to Na‛omi,
“Blessed be יהוה, who has not left you this day without
a redeemer. And let his Name be proclaimed in Yisra’ĕl! 
Ruth
4:15  “And he shall be to you a restorer
of life and a sustainer of your old age. For your daughter-in-law, who loves
you, who is better to you than seven sons, has borne him.” 
Ruth
4:16  And Na‛omi took the child and
laid him on her bosom, and became a nurse to him. 
Ruth
4:17  And the women, her neighbours, gave
him a name, saying, “There is a son born to Na‛omi.” And they called his
name Oḇĕḏ. He was the father of Yishai, the father of Dawiḏ.

Ruth
4:18  And this is the genealogy of
Perets: Perets brought forth Ḥetsron. 
Ruth
4:19  And Ḥetsron brought forth
Ram, and Ram brought forth Amminaḏaḇ. 
Ruth
4:20  And Amminaḏaḇ brought
forth Naḥshon, and Naḥshon brought forth Salmon. 
Ruth
4:21  And Salmon brought forth Bo‛az,
and Bo‛az brought forth Oḇĕḏ. 
Ruth
4:22  And Oḇĕḏ brought
forth Yishai, and Yishai brought forth Dawiḏ.
