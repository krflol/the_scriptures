Thessalonians
2Thes
1:1  Sha’ul, and Sila, and Timothy, to
the assembly of the Thessalonians in Elohim our Father and the Master יהושע
Messiah: 
2Thes
1:2  Favour to you and peace from Elohim
our Father and the Master יהושע Messiah. 
2Thes
1:3  We ought to give thanks to Elohim
always for you, brothers, as it is proper, because your belief grows
exceedingly, and the love every one of you has for each other is increasing, 
2Thes
1:4  so that we ourselves boast of you
among the assemblies of Elohim for your endurance and belief in all your
persecutions and afflictions which you are bearing, 
2Thes
1:5  clear evidence of the righteous
judgment of Elohim, in order for you to be counted worthy of the reign of
Elohim, for which you also suffer, 
2Thes
1:6  since Elohim shall rightly repay
with affliction those who afflict you, 
2Thes
1:7  and to give you who are afflicted
rest with us when the Master יהושע is revealed
from heaven with His mighty messengers, 
2Thes
1:8  in flaming fire taking vengeance on
those who do not know Elohim, and on those who do not obey the Good News of our
Master יהושע Messiah, 
2Thes
1:9  who shall be punished with
everlasting destruction from the presence of the Master and from the esteem of
His strength, 
2Thes
1:10  when He comes to be esteemed in His
set-apart ones and to be admired among all those who believe in that Day,
because our witness to you was believed. 
2Thes
1:11  To this end we always pray for you
that our Elohim would count you worthy of this calling, and complete all the
good pleasure of goodness, and the work of belief with power,
2Thes
1:12  so that the Name of our Master יהושע
Messiah is esteemed in you, and you in Him, according to the favour of our
Elohim and the Master יהושע Messiah. 
2Thes
2:1  As to the coming of our Master יהושע
Messiah and our gathering together to Him, we ask you, brothers, 
2Thes
2:2  not to become easily unsettled in
mind or troubled, either by spirit or by word or by letter, as if from us, as
if the day of יהוה has come. 
2Thes
2:3  Let no one deceive you in any way,
because the falling away is to come first, and the man of lawlessness is to be
revealed, the son of destruction,
2Thes
2:4  who opposes and exalts himself above
all that is called Elohim or that is worshipped, so that he sits as Elohim in
the Dwelling Place of Elohim, showing himself that he is Elohim. 
2Thes
2:5  Do you not remember that I told you
this while I was still with you? 
2Thes
2:6  And now you know what restrains, for
him to be revealed in his time. 
2Thes
2:7  For the secret of lawlessness is
already at work – only until he who now restrains comes out of the midst. 
2Thes
2:8  And then the lawless one shall be
revealed, whom the Master shall consume with the Spirit of His mouth and bring
to naught with the manifestation of His coming. 
2Thes
2:9  The coming of the lawless one is according to the working
of Satan, with all power and signs and wonders of falsehood, 
2Thes
2:10  and with all deceit of
unrighteousness in those perishing, because they did not receive the love of
the truth, in order for them to be saved. 
2Thes
2:11  And for this reason Elohim sends
them a working of delusion, for them to believe the falsehood,
2Thes
2:12  in order that all should be judged
who did not believe the truth, but have delighted in the unrighteousness. 
2Thes
2:13  But we ought to give thanks to
Elohim always for you, brothers, beloved by the Master, because Elohim from the
beginning chose you to be saved – in set-apartness of Spirit, and belief in the
truth –
2Thes
2:14  unto which He called you by our
Good News, for the obtaining of the esteem of our Master יהושע
Messiah. 
2Thes
2:15  So, then, brothers, stand fast and
hold the traditions which you were taught, whether by word or by our letter. 
2Thes
2:16  And our Master יהושע
Messiah Himself, and our Elohim and Father, who has loved us and given us
everlasting encouragement and good expectation, through favour, 
2Thes
2:17  encourage your hearts and establish
you in every good word and work. 
2Thes
3:1  For the rest, brothers, pray for us,
so that the Word of יהוה spreads rapidly and be
praised, as also with you, 
2Thes
3:2  and that we might be delivered from
unreasonable and wicked men, for not all have belief. 
2Thes
3:3  But the Master is trustworthy, who
shall establish you and guard you from the wicked one. 
2Thes
3:4  And we trust in the Master as to
you, both that you do and shall do what we command you. 
2Thes
3:5  And the Master direct your hearts
into the love of Elohim and into the endurance for Messiah. 
2Thes
3:6  But we command you, brothers, in the
Name of our Master יהושע Messiah, that you
withdraw from every brother who walks disorderly and not according to the
tradition which you received from us. 
2Thes
3:7  For you yourselves know how you
ought to imitate us, for we were not disorderly among you, 
2Thes
3:8  nor did we eat anyone’s bread
without paying for it, but worked with labour and toil night and day, in order
not to burden any of you, 
2Thes
3:9  not because we do not have
authority, but to make ourselves an example, for you to imitate us. 
2Thes
3:10  For even when we were with you, we
commanded you this: If anyone does not wish to work, neither let him eat. 
2Thes
3:11  For we hear of some among you
walking disorderly, not working at all, but are busybodies. 
2Thes
3:12  But we command and urge such,
through our Master יהושע Messiah, to settle down,
work and eat their own bread. 
2Thes
3:13  And you, brothers, do not grow
weary in doing good. 
2Thes
3:14  And if anyone does not obey our
word in this letter, note that one, and do not keep company with him, so that
he is put to shame. 
2Thes
3:15  However, do not regard him as an
enemy, but admonish him as a brother. 
2Thes
3:16  And the Master of peace Himself
give you peace always in every way. The Master be with you all. 
2Thes
3:17  The greeting of Sha’ul with my own
hand, which is a sign in every letter, thus I write. 
2Thes
3:18  The favour of our Master יהושע
Messiah be with you all. Amĕn.
