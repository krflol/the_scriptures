Iḇ`rim/Hebrews
Hebrew
1:1  Elohim, having of old spoken in many
portions and many ways to the fathers by the prophets, 
Hebrew
1:2  has in these last days spoken to us
by the Son, whom He has appointed heir of all, through whom also He made the
ages,
Hebrew
1:3  who being the brightness of the
esteem and the exact representation of His substance, and sustaining all by the
word of His power, having made a cleansing of our sins through Himself, sat
down at the right hand of the Greatness on high, 
Hebrew
1:4  having become so much better than
the messengers, as He has inherited a more excellent Name than them. 
Hebrew
1:5  For to which of the messengers did
He ever say, “You are My Son, today I have brought You forth”? And again, “I
shall be to Him a Father, and He shall be to Me a Son”?
Hebrew
1:6  And when He again brings the
first-born into the world, He says, “Let all the messengers of Elohim do
reverence to Him.”
Hebrew
1:7  And of the messengers indeed He
says, “... who is making His messengers spirits and His servants a flame of
fire.”
Hebrew
1:8  But to the Son He says, “Your throne, O Elohim, is forever and ever, a sceptre of
straightness is the sceptre of Your reign. 
Hebrew
1:9  “You have loved righteousness and
hated lawlessness.Because of this, Elohim, Your Elohim,has anointed You with
the oil of gladness more than Your companions.” 
Hebrew
1:10  And, “You, Master, did found the
earth in the beginning, and the heavens are the work of Your hands. 
Hebrew
1:11  “They shall perish, but You remain.
And they shall all grow old like a garment, 
Hebrew
1:12  and like a mantle You shall fold
them up, and they shall be changed. But You are the same, and Your years shall
not fail.” 
Hebrew
1:13  And to which of the messengers did
He ever say, “Sit at My right hand, until I make Your enemies a footstool for
Your feet”?
Hebrew
1:14  Are they not all serving spirits
sent out to attend those who are about to inherit deliverance? 
Hebrew
2:1  Because of this we have to pay more
attention to what we have heard, lest we drift away. 
Hebrew
2:2  For if the word spoken through
messengers proved to be firm, and every transgression and disobedience received
a right reward, 
Hebrew
2:3  how shall we escape if we neglect so
great a deliverance, which first began to be spoken by the Master, and was
confirmed to us by those that heard, 
Hebrew
2:4  Elohim also bearing witness both
with signs and wonders, with various miracles, and gifts of the Set-apart
Spirit, distributed according to His own desire? 
Hebrew
2:5  For it is not to messengers that He
has subjected the world to come, concerning which we speak. 
Hebrew
2:6  But somewhere one has witnessed,
saying, “What is man that You remember him, or the son of man that You look
after him? 
Hebrew
2:7  “You have made him a little lower
than the messengers. You have crowned him with esteem and respect, and set him
over the works of Your hands.
Hebrew
2:8  “You have put all in subjection
under his feet.” For in that He put all in subjection under him, He left none
that is not subjected to him. But now we do not yet see all subjected to him. 
Hebrew
2:9  But we do see Him who was made for a
little while lower than the messengers, יהושע,
because of the suffering of death crowned with esteem and respect, that by the
favour of Elohim He should taste death for everyone. 
Hebrew
2:10  For it was fitting for Him, because
of whom all are and through whom all are, in bringing many sons to esteem, to
make the Princely Leader of their deliverance perfect through sufferings. 
Hebrew
2:11  For both He who sets apart and
those who are being set apart are all of One, for which reason He is not
ashamed to call them brothers, 
Hebrew
2:12  saying, “I shall announce Your Name
to My brothers, in the midst of the congregation I shall sing praise to You.”
Hebrew
2:13  And again, “I shall put My trust in
Him.” And again, “See, I and the children whom Elohim gave Me.”
Hebrew
2:14  Therefore, since the children share
in flesh and blood, He Himself similarly shared in the same, so that by means
of His death He might destroy him having the power of death, that is, the
devil, 
Hebrew
2:15  and deliver those who throughout
life were held in slavery by fear of death. 
Hebrew
2:16  For, doubtless, He does not take
hold of messengers, but He does take hold of the seed of Aḇraham.
Hebrew
2:17  So in every way He had to be made
like His brothers, in order to become a compassionate and trustworthy High
Priest in matters related to Elohim, to make atonement for the sins of the
people. 
Hebrew
2:18  For in what He had suffered,
Himself being tried, He is able to help those who are tried. 
Hebrew
3:1  Therefore, set-apart brothers,
partakers of the heavenly calling, closely consider the Emissary and High
Priest of our confession, Messiah יהושע, 
Hebrew
3:2  who was trustworthy to Him who
appointed Him, as also Mosheh in all His house.
Hebrew
3:3  For this One has been deemed worthy
of more esteem than Mosheh, as much as He who built the house enjoys more
respect than the house. 
Hebrew
3:4  For every house is built by someone,
but He who built all is Elohim. 
Hebrew
3:5  And Mosheh indeed was trustworthy in
all His house as a servant, for a witness of what would be spoken later, 
Hebrew
3:6  but Messiah as a Son over His own
house, whose house we are if we hold fast the boldness and the boasting of the
expectation firm to the end. 
Hebrew
3:7  Therefore, as the Set-apart Spirit
says, “Today, if you hear His voice, 
Hebrew
3:8  do not harden your hearts as in the
rebellion, in the day of trial in the wilderness, 
Hebrew
3:9  where your fathers tried Me, proved
Me, and saw My works forty years. 
Hebrew
3:10  “Therefore I was grieved with that
generation, and said, ‘They always go astray in their heart, and they have not
known My ways.’ 
Hebrew
3:11  “As I swore in My wrath, ‘If they
shall enter into My rest...’ ”
Hebrew
3:12  Look out, brothers, lest there be
in any of you a wicked heart of unbelief in falling away from the living
Elohim, 
Hebrew
3:13  but encourage one another daily,
while it is called “Today,” lest any of you be hardened by the deceivableness
of sin. 
Hebrew
3:14  For we have become partakers of
Messiah if we hold fast the beginning of our trust firm to the end, 
Hebrew
3:15  while it is said, “Today, if you
hear His voice, do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion.”
Hebrew
3:16  For who, having heard, rebelled?
Was it not all who came out of Mitsrayim, led by Mosheh? 
Hebrew
3:17  And with whom was He grieved forty
years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose corpses fell in the wilderness? 
Hebrew
3:18  And to whom did He swear that they
would not enter into His rest, but to those who did not obey? 
Hebrew
3:19  So we see that they were unable to
enter in because of unbelief. 
Hebrew
4:1  Therefore, since a promise remains
of entering into His rest, let us fear lest any of you seem to have come short
of it. 
Hebrew
4:2  For indeed the Good News was brought
to us as well as to them, but the word which they heard did not profit them,
not having been mixed with belief in those who heard it. 
Hebrew
4:3  For we who have believed do enter
into that rest, as He has said, “As I swore in My wrath, if they shall enter
into My rest...” And yet His works have come into being from the foundation of
the world. 
Hebrew
4:4  For somewhere He has said thus about
the seventh day, “And Elohim rested on the seventh day from all His works,”
Hebrew
4:5  and in this again, “If they shall
enter into My rest...”
Hebrew
4:6  Since then it remains for some to
enter into it, and those who formerly received the Good News did not enter in
because of disobedience,
Hebrew
4:7  He again defines a certain day, “Today,”
saying through Dawiḏ so much later, as it has been said, “Today, if you
hear His voice, do not harden your hearts.” 
Hebrew
4:8  For if Yehoshua had given them rest,
He would not have spoken of another day after that. 
Hebrew
4:9  So there remains a Sabbath-keeping
for the people of Elohim. 
Hebrew
4:10  For the one, having entered into
His rest, has himself also rested from his works, as Elohim rested from His own. 
Hebrew
4:11  Let us therefore do our utmost to
enter into that rest, lest anyone fall after the same example of disobedience.
Hebrew
4:12  For the Word of Elohim is living,
and working, and sharper than any two-edged sword, cutting through even to the
dividing of being and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and able to judge the
thoughts and intentions of the heart. 
Hebrew
4:13  And there is no creature hidden
from His sight, but all are naked and laid bare before the eyes of Him with
whom is our account. 
Hebrew
4:14  Therefore, since we have a great
High Priest who has passed through the heavens, יהושע
the Son of Elohim, let us hold fast our confession. 
Hebrew
4:15  For we do not have a High Priest
unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but One who was tried in all respects
as we are, apart from sin. 
Hebrew
4:16  Therefore, let us come boldly to
the throne of favour, in order to receive compassion, and find favour for
timely help. 
Hebrew
5:1  For every priest taken from among
men is appointed on behalf of men in matters relating to Elohim, to offer both
gifts and offerings for sins, 
Hebrew
5:2  being able to have a measure of
feeling for those not knowing and being led astray, since he himself is also
surrounded by weakness. 
Hebrew
5:3  And on account of this he has to
offer for sins – as for the people, so also for himself. 
Hebrew
5:4  And no one obtains this esteem for
himself, but he who is called by Elohim, even as Aharon also was. 
Hebrew
5:5  So also the Messiah did not extol
Himself to become High Priest, but it was He who said to Him, “You are My Son,
today I have brought You forth.”
Hebrew
5:6  As He also says in another place, “You
are a priest forever according to the order of Malkitseḏeq,”
Hebrew
5:7  who, in the days of His flesh, when
He had offered up prayers and petitions with strong crying and tears to Him who
was able to save Him from death, and was heard because of His reverent fear, 
Hebrew
5:8  though being a Son, He learned
obedience by what He suffered. 
Hebrew
5:9  And having been perfected, He became
the Causer of everlasting deliverance to all those obeying Him, 
Hebrew
5:10  having been designated by Elohim a
High Priest “according to the order of Malkitseḏeq,” 
Hebrew
5:11  concerning whom we have much to
say, and hard to explain, since you have become dull of hearing. 
Hebrew
5:12  For indeed, although by this time
you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you again the first
elements of the Words of Elohim. And you have become such as need milk and not
solid food. 
Hebrew
5:13  For everyone partaking of milk is
inexperienced in the word of righteousness, for he is a babe. 
Hebrew
5:14  But solid food is for the mature
whose senses have been trained by practice to discern both good and evil. 
Hebrew
6:1  Therefore, having left the word of
the beginning of the Messiah, let us go on to perfection, not laying again the
foundation of repentance from dead works, and of belief toward Elohim,
Hebrew
6:2  of the teaching of immersions, and
of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of everlasting
judgment. 
Hebrew
6:3  And this we shall do, if Elohim
indeed permits. 
Hebrew
6:4  For it is impossible for those who
were once enlightened, and have tasted the heavenly gift, and have become
partakers of the Set-apart Spirit, 
Hebrew
6:5  and have tasted the good Word of
Elohim and the powers of the age to come, 
Hebrew
6:6  and fall away, to renew them again
to repentance – having impaled for themselves the Son of Elohim again, and put
Him to open shame.
Hebrew
6:7  For ground that is drinking the rain
often falling on it, and is bearing plants fit for those by whom it is tilled,
receives blessing from Elohim, 
Hebrew
6:8  but if it brings forth thorns and
thistles, it is rejected and near to being cursed, and ends up by being burned.

Hebrew
6:9  But although we speak in this way,
beloved, we are persuaded, concerning you, of better matters which possess
deliverance. 
Hebrew
6:10  For Elohim is not unrighteous to
forget your work and labour of love which you have shown toward His Name, in
that you have attended to the set-apart ones, and still attend. 
Hebrew
6:11  And we desire that each one of you
show the same eagerness, to the entire confirmation of expectation until the
end, 
Hebrew
6:12  in order that you do not become
sluggish, but imitate those who through belief and patience inherit the
promises. 
Hebrew
6:13  For Elohim, having promised Aḇraham,
since He could swear by no one greater, swore by Himself, 
Hebrew
6:14  saying, “Truly, blessing I shall
bless you, and increasing I shall increase you.”
Hebrew
6:15  And so, after being patient, he
obtained the promise. 
Hebrew
6:16  For men do indeed swear by the one
greater, and an oath for confirmation is for them an end of all dispute. 
Hebrew
6:17  In this way Elohim, resolving to
show even more clearly to the heirs of promise the unchangeableness of His
purpose, confirmed it by an oath, 
Hebrew
6:18  so that by two unchangeable matters
in which it is impossible for Elohim to lie, we might have strong encouragement,
we who have fled for refuge to lay hold of the expectation set before us, 
Hebrew
6:19  which we have as an anchor of the
life, both safe and firm, and entering into that within the veil, 
Hebrew
6:20  where יהושע
has entered as a forerunner for us, having become High Priest forever according
to the order of Malkitseḏeq.
Hebrew
7:1  For this Malkitseḏeq,
sovereign of Shalĕm, priest of the Most High Elohim, who met Aḇraham
returning from the slaughter of the sovereigns and blessed him, 
Hebrew
7:2  to whom also Aḇraham gave a
tenth part of all, his name being
translated, indeed, first, ‘sovereign of righteousness,’ and then also
sovereign of Shalĕm, that is, ‘sovereign of peace,’ 
Hebrew
7:3  without father, without mother,
without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but having
been made like the Son of Elohim, remains a priest for all time. 
Hebrew
7:4  Now see how great this one was, to
whom even the ancestor Aḇraham gave a tenth of the choicest booty. 
Hebrew
7:5  And truly, those who are of the sons
of Lĕwi, who receive the priesthood, have a command to receive tithes from
the people according to the Torah, that is, from their brothers, though they
have come from the loins of Aḇraham, 
Hebrew
7:6  however, the one whose genealogy is
not derived from them received tithes from Aḇraham, and blessed the one
who held the promises. 
Hebrew
7:7  And it is beyond all dispute that
the lesser is blessed by the better. 
Hebrew
7:8  And here it is men who die that
receive tithes, but there it is someone of whom it is witnessed that he lives. 
Hebrew
7:9  And one might say that through Aḇraham
even Lĕwi, who received tithes, gave tithes, 
Hebrew
7:10  for he was still in the loins of
his father when Malkitseḏeq met him. 
Hebrew
7:11  Truly, then, if perfection were
through the Lĕwitical priesthood – for under it the people were given the
Torah – why was there still need for another priest to arise according to the
order of Malkitseḏeq, and not be called according to the order of Aharon?

Hebrew
7:12  For the priesthood being changed,
of necessity there takes place a change of law also.
Hebrew
7:13  For He of whom this is said belongs
to another tribe, from which no one had attended at the altar.
Hebrew
7:14  For it is perfectly clear that our
Master arose from Yehuḏah, a tribe about which Mosheh never spoke of
concerning priesthood, 
Hebrew
7:15  and this is clearer still, if
another priest arises in the likeness of Malkitseḏeq, 
Hebrew
7:16  who has become, not according to
the Torah of fleshly command, but according to the power of an endless life, 
Hebrew
7:17  for He does witness, “You are a
priest forever according to the order of Malkitseḏeq.”
Hebrew
7:18  For there is indeed a setting aside
of the former command because of its weakness and unprofitableness, 
Hebrew
7:19  for the Torah perfected naught, but
the bringing in of a better expectation, through which we draw near to Elohim. 
Hebrew
7:20  And it was not without an oath! 
Hebrew
7:21  For they indeed became priests
without an oath, but He became Priest
with an oath by Him who said to Him, “ יהוה has sworn
and shall not regret, ‘You are a priest forever according to the order of
Malkitseḏeq.’ ”
Hebrew
7:22  By as much as this יהושע
has become a guarantor of a better covenant. 
Hebrew
7:23  And indeed, those that became
priests were many, because they were prevented by death from continuing, 
Hebrew
7:24  but He, because He remains forever,
has an unchangeable priesthood. 
Hebrew
7:25  Therefore He is also able to save
completely those who draw near to Elohim through Him, ever living to make
intercession for them. 
Hebrew
7:26  For it was fitting that we should
have such a High Priest – kind, innocent, undefiled, having been separated from
sinners, and exalted above the heavens, 
Hebrew
7:27  who does not need, as those high
priests, to offer up slaughter offerings
day by day, first for His own sins and then for those of the people, for this
He did once for all when He offered up Himself. 
Hebrew
7:28  For the Torah appoints as high
priests men who have weakness, but the word of the oath which came after the
Torah, appoints the Son having been
perfected forever. 
Hebrew
8:1  Now the summary of what we are
saying is: We have such a High Priest, who is seated at the right hand of the
throne of the Greatness in the heavens, 
Hebrew
8:2  and who serves in the set-apart
place and of the true Tent, which יהוה set up, and not
man. 
Hebrew
8:3  For every high priest is appointed
to offer both gifts and slaughters. So it was also necessary for this One to
have somewhat to offer. 
Hebrew
8:4  For if indeed He were on earth, He
would not be a priest, since there are priests who offer the gifts according to
the Torah, 
Hebrew
8:5  who serve a copy and shadow of the
heavenly, as Mosheh was warned when he was about to make the Tent. For He said,
“See that you make all according to the pattern shown you on the mountain.” 
Hebrew
8:6  But now He has obtained a more
excellent service, inasmuch as He is also Mediatorof a better covenant, which
was constituted on better promises. 
Hebrew
8:7  For if that first covenant had been faultless, then no
place would have been sought for a second. 
Hebrew
8:8  For finding fault with them, He
says, “See, the days are coming,” says יהוה, “when I
shall conclude with the house of Yisra’ĕl and with the house of Yehuḏah
a renewed covenant, 
Hebrew
8:9  not according to the covenant that I
made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out
of the land of Mitsrayim, because they did not continue in My covenant, and I
disregarded them,” says יהוה. 
Hebrew
8:10  “Because this is the covenant that
I shall make with the house of Yisra’ĕl after those days, says יהוה,
giving My laws in their mind, and I shall write them on their hearts, and I
shall be their Elohim, and they shall be My people. 
Hebrew
8:11  “And they shall by no means teach
each one his neighbour, and each one his brother, saying, ‘Know יהוה,’
because they all shall know Me, from the least of them to the greatest of them.

Hebrew
8:12  “Because I shall forgive their
unrighteousness, and their sins and their lawlessnesses I shall no longer
remember.”
Hebrew
8:13  By saying, ‘renewed,’ He has made
the first old. Now what becomes old and growing aged is near disappearing. 
Hebrew
9:1  Now the first covenant indeed had regulations of worship and the earthly
set-apart place. 
Hebrew
9:2  For a Tent was prepared: the first
part, in which was the lampstand, and the table, and the showbread, which is
called the Set-apart Place. 
Hebrew
9:3  And after the second veil, the part
of the Tent which is called Most Set-apart, 
Hebrew
9:4  to which belonged the golden censer,
and the ark of the covenant overlaid on all sides with gold, in which were the
golden pot that held the manna, and the rod of Aharon that budded, and the
tablets of the covenant, 
Hebrew
9:5  and above it the keruḇim of
esteem were overshadowing the place of atonement – about which we do not now
speak in detail. 
Hebrew
9:6  And these having been prepared like
this, the priests always went into the first part of the Tent, accomplishing
the services. 
Hebrew
9:7  But into the second part the high
priest went alone once a year, not without blood, which he offered for himself
and for sins of ignorance of the people,
Hebrew
9:8  the Set-apart Spirit signifying
this, that the way into the Most Set-apart Place was not yet made manifest
while the first Tent has a standing, 
Hebrew
9:9  which was a parable for the present
time in which both gifts and slaughters are offered which are unable to perfect
the one serving, as to his conscience, 
Hebrew
9:10  only as to foods and drinks, and
different washings, and fleshly regulations imposed until a time of setting matters straight. 
Hebrew
9:11  But Messiah, having become a High
Priest of the coming good matters,
through the greater and more perfect Tent not made with hands, that is, not of
this creation, 
Hebrew
9:12  entered into the Most Set-apart
Place once for all, not with the blood of goats and calves, but with His own
blood, having obtained everlasting redemption. 
Hebrew
9:13  For if the blood of bulls and goats
and the ashes of a heifer, sprinkling the defiled, sets apart for the cleansing
of the flesh, 
Hebrew
9:14  how much more shall the blood of
the Messiah, who through the everlasting Spirit offered Himself unblemished to
Elohim, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living Elohim? 
Hebrew
9:15  And because of this He is the
Mediator of a renewed covenant, so that, death having taken place for
redemption of the transgressions under the first covenant, those who are called
might receive the promise of the everlasting inheritance. 
Hebrew
9:16  For where a covenant is, it is
necessary for the death of the covenanted one to be established. 
Hebrew
9:17  For a covenant over those dead is
firm, since it is never valid while the covenanted one is living. 
Hebrew
9:18  Therefore not even the first covenant was instituted without blood. 
Hebrew
9:19  For when, according to Torah, every
command had been spoken by Mosheh to all the people, he took the blood of
calves and goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both
the book itself and all the people, 
Hebrew
9:20  saying, “This is the blood of the
covenant which Elohim commanded you.”
Hebrew
9:21  And in the same way he sprinkled
with blood both the Tent and all the vessels of the service. 
Hebrew
9:22  And, according to the Torah, almost
all is cleansed with blood, and without shedding of blood there is no
forgiveness. 
Hebrew
9:23  It was necessary, then, that the
copies of the heavenly ones should be cleansed with these, but the heavenly
ones themselves with better slaughter offerings
than these. 
Hebrew
9:24  For Messiah has not entered into a
Set-apart Place made by hand – figures of the true – but into the heaven
itself, now to appear in the presence of Elohim on our behalf, 
Hebrew
9:25  not that He should offer Himself
often, as the high priest enters into the Set-apart Place year by year with
blood not his own. 
Hebrew
9:26  For if so, He would have had to
suffer often, since the foundation of the world. But now He has appeared once
for all at the end of the ages to put away sin by the offering of Himself. 
Hebrew
9:27  And as it awaits men to die once,
and after this the judgment, 
Hebrew
9:28  so also the Messiah, having been
offered once to bear the sins of many, shall appear a second time, apart from
sin, to those waiting for Him, unto deliverance. 
Hebrew
10:1  For the Torah, having a shadow of
the good matters to come, and not the
image itself of the matters, was never able to make perfect those who draw near
with the same slaughter offerings
which they offer continually year by year. 
Hebrew
10:2  Otherwise, would they not have
ceased to be offered? Because those who served, once cleansed, would have had
no more consciousness of sins. 
Hebrew
10:3  But in those offerings is a reminder of sins year by year. 
Hebrew
10:4  For it is impossible for blood of
bulls and goats to take away sins. 
Hebrew
10:5  Therefore, coming into the world,
He says, “Slaughtering and meal offering You did not desire, but a body You
have prepared for Me. 
Hebrew
10:6  “In burnt offerings and offerings for sin You did not delight.
Hebrew
10:7  “Then I said, ‘See, I come – in the
roll of the book it has been written concerning Me – to do Your desire, O
Elohim.’ ”
Hebrew
10:8  Saying above, “Slaughter and meal
offering, and burnt offerings, and offerings
for sin You did not desire, nor delighted in,” which are offered according to
the Torah, 
Hebrew
10:9  then He said, “See, I come to do
Your desire, O Elohim.” He takes away the first to establish the second. 
Hebrew
10:10  By that desire we have been set
apart through the offering of the body of יהושע
Messiah once for all. 
Hebrew
10:11  And indeed every priest stands day
by day doing service, and repeatedly offering the same slaughter offerings which are never able to take
away sins. 
Hebrew
10:12  But He, having offered one
slaughter offering for sins for all
time, sat down at the right hand of Elohim, 
Hebrew
10:13  waiting from that time onward
until His enemies are made a footstool for His feet.
Hebrew
10:14  For by one offering He has
perfected for all time those who are being set apart. 
Hebrew
10:15  And the Set-apart Spirit also
witnesses to us, for after having said before, 
Hebrew
10:16  “This is the covenant that I shall
make with them after those days, says יהוה, giving My
laws into their hearts, and in their minds I shall write them,”
Hebrew
10:17  and, “Their sins and their
lawlessnesses I shall remember no more.” 
Hebrew
10:18  Now where there is forgiveness of
these, there is no longer a slaughter offering
for sin. 
Hebrew
10:19  So, brothers, having boldness to
enter into the Set-apart Place by the blood of יהושע,

Hebrew
10:20  by a new and living way which He
instituted for us, through the veil, that is, His flesh, 
Hebrew
10:21  and having a High Priest over the House of Elohim, 
Hebrew
10:22  let us draw near with a true heart
in completeness of belief, having our hearts sprinkled from a wicked conscience
and our bodies washed with clean water. 
Hebrew
10:23  Let us hold fast the confession of
our expectation without yielding, for He who promised is trustworthy. 
Hebrew
10:24  And let us be concerned for one
another in order to stir up love and good works,
Hebrew
10:25  not forsaking the assembling of
ourselves together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging, and so much more
as you see the Day coming near. 
Hebrew
10:26  For if we sin purposely after we
have received the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a slaughter offering for sins,
Hebrew
10:27  but some fearsome anticipation of
judgment, and a fierce fire which is about to consume the opponents.
Hebrew
10:28  Anyone who has disregarded the
Torah of Mosheh dies without compassion on the witness of two or three
witnesses. 
Hebrew
10:29  How much worse punishment do you
think shall he deserve who has trampled the Son of Elohim underfoot, counted
the blood of the covenant by which he was set apart as common, and insulted the
Spirit of favour? 
Hebrew
10:30  For we know Him who has said, “Vengeance
is Mine, I shall repay, says יהוה.” And again, “ יהוה
shall judge His people.”
Hebrew
10:31  It is fearsome to fall into the
hands of the living Elohim. 
Hebrew
10:32  But remember the former days,
when, after you were enlightened, you endured a great struggle with sufferings.

Hebrew
10:33  On the one hand you were exposed
to reproaches and pressures, and on the other hand you became sharers with
those who were so treated, 
Hebrew
10:34  for you sympathised with me in my
chains, and you accepted with joy the seizure of your possessions, knowing that
you have a better and a lasting possession for yourselves in the heavens. 
Hebrew
10:35  Do not, then, lose your boldness,
which has great reward. 
Hebrew
10:36  For you have need of endurance, so
that when you have done the desire of Elohim, you receive the promise: 
Hebrew
10:37  “For yet a little while – He who
is coming shall come and shall not delay.” 
Hebrew
10:38  “But the righteous shall live by
belief, but if anyone draws back, my being has no pleasure in him.”
Hebrew
10:39  But we are not of those who draw
back to destruction, but of belief to the preservation of life. 
Hebrew
11:1  And belief is the substance of what
is expected, the proof of what is not seen. 
Hebrew
11:2  For by this the elders obtained
witness. 
Hebrew
11:3  By belief, we understand that the
ages were prepared by the word of Elohim, so that what is seen was not made of
what is visible. 
Hebrew
11:4  By belief, Heḇel offered to
Elohim a greater slaughter offering
than Qayin, through which he obtained witness that he was righteous, Elohim
witnessing of his gifts. And through it, having died, he still speaks. 
Hebrew
11:5  By belief, Ḥanoḵ was
translated so as not to see death, “and was not found because Elohim had
translated him.” For before his translation he obtained witness, that he
pleased Elohim. 
Hebrew
11:6  But without belief it is impossible
to please Him, for he who comes to Elohim has to believe that He is, and that
He is a rewarder of those who earnestly seek Him. 
Hebrew
11:7  By belief, Noaḥ, having been
warned of what was yet unseen, having feared, prepared an ark to save his
house, through which he condemned the world and became heir of the
righteousness which is according to belief. 
Hebrew
11:8  By belief, Aḇraham obeyed
when he was called to go out to the place which he was about to receive as an
inheritance. And he went out, not knowing where he was going. 
Hebrew
11:9  By belief, he sojourned in the land
of promise as a stranger, dwelling in tents with Yitsḥaq and Ya‛aqoḇ,
the heirs with him of the same promise, 
Hebrew
11:10  for he was looking for the city
having foundations, whose builder and maker is Elohim. 
Hebrew
11:11  By belief also, Sarah herself was
enabled to conceive seed, and she bore a child when she was past the normal
age, because she deemed Him trustworthy who had promised. 
Hebrew
11:12  And so from one, and him as good
as dead, were born as numerous as the stars of the heaven, as countless as the
sand which is by the seashore.
Hebrew
11:13  In belief all these died, not
having received the promises, but seeing them from a distance, welcomed and
embraced them, and confessed that they were aliens and strangers on the earth.
Hebrew
11:14  For those who speak this way make
it clear that they seek a fatherland. 
Hebrew
11:15  And yet, if they had indeed kept
remembering that place from which
they had come out, they would have had the chance to return. 
Hebrew
11:16  But now they long for a better place, that is, a heavenly. Therefore
Elohim is not ashamed to be called their Elohim, for He has prepared a city for
them. 
Hebrew
11:17  By belief, Aḇraham, when he
was tried, offered up Yitsḥaq, and he who had received the promises
offered up his only brought-forth son, 
Hebrew
11:18  of whom it was said, “In
Yitsḥaq your seed shall be called,”
Hebrew
11:19  reckoning that Elohim was able to
raise, even from the dead, from which he received him back, as a type. 
Hebrew
11:20  By belief, Yitsḥaq blessed
Ya‛aqoḇ and Ĕsaw concerning that which was to come. 
Hebrew
11:21  By belief, Ya‛aqoḇ,
when he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Yosĕph, and did reverence
on the top of his staff. 
Hebrew
11:22  By belief, Yosĕph, when he
was dying, made mention of the outgoing of the children of Yisra’ĕl, and
gave orders concerning his bones. 
Hebrew
11:23  By belief, Mosheh, having been
born, was hidden three months by his parents, because they saw he was a comely
child, and were not afraid of the sovereign’s command. 
Hebrew
11:24  By belief, Mosheh, having become
great, refused to be called the son of the daughter of Pharaoh, 
Hebrew
11:25  choosing rather to be afflicted
with the people of Elohim than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a time, 
Hebrew
11:26  deeming the reproach of Messiah
greater riches than the treasures in Mitsrayim, for he was looking to the
reward. 
Hebrew
11:27  By belief, he left Mitsrayim, not
fearing the wrath of the sovereign, for he was steadfast, as seeing Him who is
invisible. 
Hebrew
11:28  By belief, he performed the
Passover and the sprinkling of blood, lest he who destroyed the first-born
should touch them. 
Hebrew
11:29  By belief, they passed through the
Red Sea as by dry land, and when the Mitsrites tried it, they were drowned. 
Hebrew
11:30  By belief, the walls of
Yeriḥo fell, having been surrounded for seven days. 
Hebrew
11:31  By belief, Raḥaḇ the
whore did not perish with those who did not believe, having received the spies
with peace. 
Hebrew
11:32  And what more shall I say? For the
time would fail me to relate of Gid‛on and Baraq and Shimshon and
Yiphtaḥ, also of Dawiḏ and Shemu’ĕl and the prophets, 
Hebrew
11:33  who through belief, overcame
reigns, worked righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, 
Hebrew
11:34  quenched the power of fire,
escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, became mighty
in battle, put foreign armies to flight. 
Hebrew
11:35  Women received back their dead by resurrection. And
others were tortured, not accepting release, to obtain a better resurrection. 
Hebrew
11:36  And others had trial of mockings
and floggings and more, of chains and imprisonment. 
Hebrew
11:37  They were stoned, they were tried,
they were sawn in two, they were slain with the sword. They went about in
sheepskins, in goatskins, being in need, afflicted, mistreated, 
Hebrew
11:38  of whom the world was not worthy –
wandering in deserts and mountains and caves and holes of the earth. 
Hebrew
11:39  And having obtained witness
through the belief, all these did not receive the promise,
Hebrew
11:40  Elohim having provided what is
better for us, that they should not be made perfect apart from us. 
Hebrew
12:1  We too, then, having so great a
cloud of witnesses all around us, let us lay aside every weight and the sin
which so easily entangles us, and let us run with endurance the race set before
us, 
Hebrew
12:2  looking to the Princely Leader and
Perfecter of our belief, יהושע, who for the joy
that was set before Him endured the stake, having despised the shame, and sat
down at the right hand of the throne of Elohim. 
Hebrew
12:3  For consider Him who endured such opposition
from sinners against Himself, lest you become weary and faint in your lives. 
Hebrew
12:4  You have not yet resisted unto
blood, striving against sin. 
Hebrew
12:5  And you have forgotten the appeal
which speaks to you as to sons, “My son, do not despise the discipline of יהוה,
nor faint when you are reproved by Him, 
Hebrew
12:6  for whom יהוה
loves, He disciplines, and flogs every son whom He receives.”
Hebrew
12:7  If you endure discipline, Elohim is
treating you as sons. For what son is there whom a father does not discipline? 
Hebrew
12:8  But if you are without discipline,
of which all have become sharers, then you are illegitimate and not sons. 
Hebrew
12:9  Moreover, we indeed had fathers of
our flesh disciplining us, and we paid them respect. Shall we not much rather
be subject to the Father of spirits, and live? 
Hebrew
12:10  For they indeed disciplined us for
a few days as seemed best to them, but He does it for our profit, so that we
might share His apartness. 
Hebrew
12:11  And indeed, no discipline seems
pleasant at the time, but grievous, but afterward it yields the peaceable fruit
of righteousness to those who have been trained by it.
Hebrew
12:12  So, strengthen the hands which
hang down and the weak knees,
Hebrew
12:13  and make straight paths for your
feet, lest the lame be turned aside, but instead, to be healed. 
Hebrew
12:14  Pursue peace with all, and pursue
apartness without which no one shall see the Master. 
Hebrew
12:15  See to it that no one falls short
of the favour of Elohim, that no root of bitterness springing up causes
trouble, by which many become defiled, 
Hebrew
12:16  lest there be anyone who whores,
or profane one, like Ĕsaw, who for a single meal sold his birthright. 
Hebrew
12:17  For you know that afterward, when
he wished to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no place for
repentance, though he sought it with tears. 
Hebrew
12:18  For you have not drawn near to a
mountain touched and scorched with fire, and to blackness, and darkness and
storm, 
Hebrew
12:19  and a sound of a trumpet, and a
voice of words, so that those who heard it begged that no further Word should
be spoken to them,
Hebrew
12:20  for they could not bear what was
commanded, “If even a beast touches the mountain, it shall be stoned or shot
through with an arrow.” 
Hebrew
12:21  And so fearsome was the sight that
Mosheh said, “I exceedingly fear and tremble.”
Hebrew
12:22  But you have drawn near to Mount
Tsiyon and to the city of the living Elohim, to the heavenly Yerushalayim, to
myriads of messengers, 
Hebrew
12:23  to the entire gathering and
assembly of the first-born having been enrolled in heaven, and to Elohim the
Judge of all, and to the spirits of righteous men made perfect, 
Hebrew
12:24  and to יהושע
the Mediator of a new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling which speaks
better than the blood of Heḇel.
Hebrew
12:25  Take heed not to refuse the One
speaking. For if those did not escape who refused the warning on earth, much
less we who turn away from Him from heaven, 
Hebrew
12:26  whose voice shook the earth then,
but now He has promised, saying, “Yet once more I shake not only the earth, but
also the heaven.”
Hebrew
12:27  And this, “Yet once more,” makes
clear the removal of what is shaken – as having been made – so that the
unshaken matters might remain. 
Hebrew
12:28  Therefore, receiving an
unshakeable reign, let us hold the favour, through which we serve Elohim
pleasingly with reverence and awe, 
Hebrew
12:29  for indeed, our Elohim is a
consuming fire.
Hebrew
13:1  Let the brotherly love continue. 
Hebrew
13:2  Do not forget to receive strangers,
for by so doing some have unwittingly entertained messengers. 
Hebrew
13:3  Remember the prisoners as if
chained with them, and those being mistreated, since you yourselves also are in
the body. 
Hebrew
13:4  Let marriage be respected by all,
and the bed be undefiled. But Elohim shall judge those who whore, and
adulterers. 
Hebrew
13:5  Let
your way of life be without the love of money, and be satisfied with what
you have. For He Himself has said, “I shall never leave you nor forsake you,”
Hebrew
13:6  so that we boldly say, “ יהוה
is my helper, I shall not fear what man shall do to me.”
Hebrew
13:7  Remember those leading you, who
spoke the Word of Elohim to you. Consider the outcome of their way of life and
imitate their belief. 
Hebrew
13:8  יהושע
Messiah is the same yesterday, and today, and forever. 
Hebrew
13:9  Do not be borne about by various
and strange teachings. For it is good for the heart to be established by
favour, not with foods which have not profited those who have been occupied
with them.
Hebrew
13:10  We have an altar from which those
serving the Tent have no authority to eat. 
Hebrew
13:11  For the bodies of those beasts whose
blood is brought into the Set-apart Place by the high priest for sin, are
burned outside the camp. 
Hebrew
13:12  And so יהושע
also suffered outside the gate, to set apart the people with His own blood. 
Hebrew
13:13  Let us, then, go to Him outside the
camp, bearing His reproach. 
Hebrew
13:14  For we have no lasting city here,
but we seek the one coming. 
Hebrew
13:15  Through Him then, let us
continually offer up a slaughter offering
of praise to Elohim, that is, the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to His Name.
Hebrew
13:16  And do not forget to do good and
to share, for with such slaughter offerings
Elohim is well pleased. 
Hebrew
13:17  Obey those leading you, and be
subject to them, for they watch for
your lives, as having to give account. Let them do so with joy and not
groaning, for that would be of no advantage to you. 
Hebrew
13:18  Pray for us, for we trust that we
have a good conscience, desiring to behave well in every way. 
Hebrew
13:19  But I particularly encourage you
to do this, that I might be restored to you the sooner. 
Hebrew
13:20  And the Elohim of peace who
brought up our Master יהושע from the dead, that
great Shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant, 
Hebrew
13:21  make you perfect in every good work
to do His desire, working in you what is pleasing in His sight, through יהושע
Messiah, to whom be esteem forever and ever. Amĕn.
Hebrew
13:22  And I call upon you, brothers,
bear with the word of encouragement for I have written to you in few words. 
Hebrew
13:23  Know that brother Timothy has been
released, with whom I shall see you if he comes shortly. 
Hebrew
13:24  Greet all those leading you, and
all the set-apart ones. Those from Italy greet you. 
Hebrew
13:25  Favour be with you all. Amĕn.
