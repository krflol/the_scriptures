Mishlĕ/Proverbs
Prov
1:1  The proverbs of Shelomoh son of Dawiḏ,
sovereign of Yisra’ĕl:
Prov
1:2  For knowing wisdom and discipline,
For understanding the words of understanding,
Prov
1:3  For receiving the discipline of
wisdom, Righteousness, right-ruling, and straightness;
Prov
1:4  For giving insight to the simple,
Knowledge and discretion to the young.
Prov
1:5  The wise one hears and increases
learning, And the understanding one gets wise counsel,
Prov
1:6  For understanding a proverb and a
figure, The words of the wise and their riddles.
Prov
1:7  The fear of יהוה
is the beginning of knowledge; Fools despise wisdom and discipline.
Prov
1:8  My son, heed the discipline of your
father, And do not forsake the Torah of your mother;
Prov
1:9  For they are a fair wreath on your
head, And chains about your neck.
Prov
1:10  My son, if sinners entice you, do
not give in.
Prov
1:11  If they say, “Come with us, let us
lie in wait for blood, Let us ambush the innocent without cause.
Prov
1:12  “Let us swallow them alive like the
grave, And entirely, like those going down to the pit.
Prov
1:13  “Let us find all precious goods,
Let us fill our houses with spoil.
Prov
1:14  “Cast in your lot among us, Let us
all have one purse,”
Prov
1:15  My son, do not walk in the way with
them, Keep your foot from their path;
Prov
1:16  For their feet run to evil, And
they hurry to shed blood.
Prov
1:17  For in vain the net is spread In
the sight of any bird.
Prov
1:18  But they lie in wait for their own
blood, They ambush their own lives.
Prov
1:19  Such are the ways of everyone
greedy for gain; It takes away the life of its owners.
Prov
1:20  Wisdom calls aloud outside; She
raises her voice in the broad places.
Prov
1:21  At the head of the noisy streets
she cries out, At the openings of the gates, In the city she speaks her words:
Prov
1:22  “How long, you simple ones, Would
you love simplicity, And shall scoffers delight in their scoffing, And fools
hate knowledge?
Prov
1:23  “Turn at my reproof. See, I pour
out my spirit on you, I make my words known to you.
Prov
1:24  “Because I called and you refused,
I have stretched out my hand and no one inclined,
Prov
1:25  “And you spurned all my counsel,
And would not yield to my reproof,
Prov
1:26  “Let me also laugh at your
calamity, Mock when your dread comes,
Prov
1:27  “When your dread comes like a
storm, And your calamity comes like a whirlwind, When distress and anguish come
upon you.
Prov
1:28  “Let them then call on me, but I
answer not; Let them seek me, but not find me.
Prov
1:29  “Because they hated knowledge And
did not choose the fear of יהוה,
Prov
1:30  “They did not accept my counsel,
They despised all my reproof,
Prov
1:31  “Therefore let them eat the fruit
of their own way, And be filled with their own counsels.
Prov
1:32  “For the turning away of the simple
slays them, And the complacency of fools destroys them.
Prov
1:33  “But whoever listens to me dwells
safely, And is at ease from the dread of evil.”
Prov
2:1  My son, if you accept my words, And
treasure up my commands with you,
Prov
2:2  So that you make your ear attend to
wisdom, Incline your heart to understanding;
Prov
2:3  For if you cry for discernment, Lift
up your voice for understanding,
Prov
2:4  If you seek her as silver, And
search for her as hidden treasures,
Prov
2:5  Then you would understand the fear
of יהוה, And find the knowledge of Elohim.
Prov
2:6  For יהוה
gives wisdom; Out of His mouth come
knowledge and understanding.
Prov
2:7  And He treasures up stability for
the straight, A shield to those walking blamelessly,
Prov
2:8  To watch over the paths of
right-ruling, And the way of His kind ones He guards.
Prov
2:9  Then you would understand
righteousness And right-ruling, and straightness – Every good path.
Prov
2:10  For wisdom would enter your heart,
And knowledge be pleasant to your being,
Prov
2:11  Discretion would guard you;
Understanding would watch over you,
Prov
2:12  To deliver you from the evil way,
From the man who speaks perversities,
Prov
2:13  Those who leave the paths of
straightness To walk in the ways of darkness;
Prov
2:14  Who rejoice to do evil; They
delight in the perversities of evil;
Prov
2:15  Whose paths are crooked, And they
are perverted in their ways;
Prov
2:16  To deliver you from the strange
woman, From the foreigner who flatters with her words,
Prov
2:17  Who forsakes the companion of her
youth, And has forgotten the covenant of her Elohim.
Prov
2:18  For her house has sunk down to
death, And her paths to the dead;
Prov
2:19  None going in to her does return,
Nor do they reach the paths of life –
Prov
2:20  So walk in the way of goodness, And
guard the paths of righteousness.
Prov
2:21  For the straight shall dwell in the
earth, And the perfect be left in it;
Prov
2:22  But the wrong shall be cut off from
the earth, And the treacherous ones plucked out of it.
Prov
3:1  My son, do not forget my Torah, And
let your heart watch over my commands;
Prov
3:2  For length of days and long life And
peace they add to you.
Prov
3:3  Let not kindness and truth forsake
you – Bind them around your neck, Write them on the tablet of your heart,
Prov
3:4  Thus finding favour and good insight
In the eyes of Elohim and man.
Prov
3:5  Trust in יהוה
with all your heart, And lean not on your own understanding;
Prov
3:6  Know Him in all your ways, And He
makes all your paths straight.
Prov
3:7  Do not be wise in your own eyes;
Fear יהוה and turn away from evil.
Prov
3:8  It is healing to your navel, And
moistening to your bones.
Prov
3:9  Esteem יהוה
with your goods, And with the first-fruits of all your increase;
Prov
3:10  Then your storehouses shall be
filled with plenty, And your vats overflow with new wine.
Prov
3:11  My son, do not despise the
discipline of יהוה, And do not loathe His reproof;
Prov
3:12  For whom יהוה
loves He reproves, As a father the son whom he delights in.
Prov
3:13  Blessed is the man who has found
wisdom, And the man who gets understanding;
Prov
3:14  For the gain from it is better Than
gain from silver, And its increase than fine gold.
Prov
3:15  She is more precious than rubies,
And all your delights are not comparable to her.
Prov
3:16  Length of days is in her right
hand, Riches and esteem in her left hand.
Prov
3:17  Her ways are pleasant ways, And all
her paths are peace.
Prov
3:18  She is a tree of life to those
taking hold of her, And blessed are all who retain her.
Prov
3:19  יהוה
founded the earth by wisdom; He established the heavens by understanding;
Prov
3:20  By His knowledge the depths were
broken up, And clouds drop down dew.
Prov
3:21  My son, let them not depart from
your eyes; Watch over sound wisdom and discretion;
Prov
3:22  Then they become life to your being
And an adorning to your neck.
Prov
3:23  Then you would walk safely in your
way, And your foot would not stumble.
Prov
3:24  When you lie down, you need not be
afraid. And you shall lie down and your sleep shall be sweet.
Prov
3:25  Do not be afraid of sudden dread,
Nor of the ruin of the wrong when it comes;
Prov
3:26  For יהוה is
at your side, And He shall guard your foot from being caught.
Prov
3:27  Do not withhold good from those who
deserve it, When it is in the power of your hand to do so.
Prov
3:28  Do not say to your neighbour, “Go,
and come back, and tomorrow I give it,” When you have it with you.
Prov
3:29  Do not plan evil against your
neighbour, Seeing he dwells safely beside you.
Prov
3:30  Do not strive with a man without
cause, If he has done you no evil.
Prov
3:31  Do not envy a cruel man, And choose
none of his ways;
Prov
3:32  For the perverse one is an
abomination to יהוה, And His secret counsel is with the
straight.
Prov
3:33  The curse of יהוה
is on the house of the wrong, But He blesses the home of the righteous.
Prov
3:34  He certainly scoffs the scoffers,
But gives favour to the humble.
Prov
3:35  The wise do inherit esteem, But
fools are bearing away shame!
Prov
4:1  Children, listen to the discipline
of a father, And give attention to know understanding;
Prov
4:2  For I gave you good instruction: Do
not forsake my Torah.
Prov
4:3  For I was my father’s son, Tender
and the only one in the eyes of my mother,
Prov
4:4  Then he taught me and said to me, “Let
your heart hold fast my words; Guard my commands, and live.
Prov
4:5  “Get wisdom! Get understanding! Do
not forget, and do not turn away From the words of my mouth.
Prov
4:6  “Do not leave her, and let her guard
you; Love her, and let her watch over you.
Prov
4:7  “The beginning of wisdom is: Get
wisdom! And with all your getting, get understanding.
Prov
4:8  “Exalt her, and let her uplift you;
She brings you esteem when you embrace her.
Prov
4:9  “She gives your head a fair wreath,
She shields you with an adorning crown.”
Prov
4:10  Hear, my son, and accept my words,
And let the years of your life be many.
Prov
4:11  I have taught you in the way of
wisdom, I have led you in straight paths.
Prov
4:12  When you walk your steps shall not
be hindered, And if you run you shall not stumble.
Prov
4:13  Hold fast to discipline, do not let
go; Watch over her, for she is your life.
Prov
4:14  Do not enter the path of the wrong,
And do not walk in the way of evil-doers.
Prov
4:15  Avoid it, do not pass by it; Turn
away from it and pass on.
Prov
4:16  For they do not sleep unless they
have done evil. And their sleep is taken away unless they make someone fall.
Prov
4:17  For they have eaten the bread of
wrongdoing, And they drink the wine of violence.
Prov
4:18  But the path of the righteous is
like the light of dawn, That shines ever brighter unto the perfect day.
Prov
4:19  The way of the wrong is like
darkness; They do not know at what they stumble.
Prov
4:20  My son, listen to my words; Incline
your ear to my sayings.
Prov
4:21  Let them not depart from your eyes;
Guard them in the midst of your heart;
Prov
4:22  For they are life to those who find
them, And healing to all their flesh.
Prov
4:23  Watch over your heart with all
diligence, For out of it are the sources of life.
Prov
4:24  Turn away from you a crooked mouth,
And put perverse lips far from you.
Prov
4:25  Let your eyes look forward, And
your eyelids look straight before you.
Prov
4:26  Consider the path of your feet, And
all your ways are established.
Prov
4:27  Do not turn to the right or the
left; Turn your foot away from evil.
Prov
5:1  My son, listen to my wisdom; Incline
your ear to my understanding,
Prov
5:2  So as to watch over discretion, And
your lips guard knowledge.
Prov
5:3  For the lips of a strange woman drip
honey, And her mouth is smoother than oil;
Prov
5:4  But in the end she is bitter as
wormwood, Sharp as a two-edged sword.
Prov
5:5  Her feet go down to death, Her steps
lay hold of the grave.
Prov
5:6  She does not consider the path of
life; Her ways are unstable – you do not know it.
Prov
5:7  So now, listen to me, you children,
And do not turn away from the words of my mouth.
Prov
5:8  Keep your way far from her, And do
not come near the door of her house,
Prov
5:9  Lest you give your splendour to
others, And your years to one who is cruel;
Prov
5:10  Lest strangers be filled with your
strength, And your labours go to the house of a foreigner.
Prov
5:11  Then you shall howl in your latter
end, When your flesh and your body are consumed,
Prov
5:12  And shall say, “How I have hated
discipline, And my heart has despised reproof!
Prov
5:13  “And I have not heeded the voice of
my teachers, And I have not inclined my ear to those who instructed me!
Prov
5:14  “In a little while I was in all
evil, In the midst of an assembly and a congregation.”
Prov
5:15  Drink water from your own cistern,
And running water from your own well.
Prov
5:16  Should your springs be scattered
abroad, Rivers of water in the streets?
Prov
5:17  And not for strangers with you.
Prov
5:18  Let your fountain be blessed, And
rejoice with the wife of your youth –
Prov
5:19  A loving deer and a pleasant doe!
Let her breasts satisfy you at all times. And be captivated by her love always.
Prov
5:20  For why should you, my son, Be
captivated by a strange woman, And embrace the bosom of a foreigner?
Prov
5:21  For the ways of man Are before the
eyes of יהוה, And He considers all his paths.
Prov
5:22  The wrong one is entrapped In his
own crookednesses, And he is caught in the cords of his sin.
Prov
5:23  He dies for lack of discipline, And
in the greatness of his folly He goes astray.
Prov
6:1  My son, if you: Have become
guarantor for your friend, Have shaken hands in pledge for a stranger,
Prov
6:2  Have been snared by the words of
your own mouth, Have been caught by the words of your mouth –
Prov
6:3  Do this at once, my son, and deliver
yourself, For you have come into the hand of your friend: Go, humble yourself,
and urge your friend.
Prov
6:4  Give no sleep to your eyes, Nor
slumber to your eyelids.
Prov
6:5  Deliver yourself like a gazelle from
the hunter’s hand, And like a bird
from the hand of the trapper.
Prov
6:6  Go to the ant, you lazy one! See her
ways and be wise,
Prov
6:7  Which, having no commander, overseer
or ruler, 
Prov
6:8  Provides her supplies in the summer,
Gathers her food in the harvest.
Prov
6:9  How long would you lie down, O lazy
one? When do you arise from your sleep?
Prov
6:10  A little sleep, a little slumber, A
little folding of the hands to lie down;
Prov
6:11  And your poverty shall come like a
prowler, And your need as an armed man.
Prov
6:12  A man of Beliya‛al, a wicked
man, Walks with a perverse mouth,
Prov
6:13  Winks with his eyes, shuffles his
feet, Points with his fingers;
Prov
6:14  Perverseness is in his heart,
Plotting evil at all times, He sends out strife.
Prov
6:15  Therefore his calamity comes
suddenly; Instantly he is broken, And there is no healing.
Prov
6:16  These six matters יהוה hates, And seven are an
abomination to Him:
Prov
6:17  A proud look, A lying tongue, And
hands shedding innocent blood,
Prov
6:18  A heart devising wicked schemes,
Feet quick to run to evil,
Prov
6:19  A false witness breathing out lies,
And one who causes strife among brothers.
Prov
6:20  My son, watch over your father’s
command, And do not forsake the Torah of your mother.
Prov
6:21  Bind them on your heart always; Tie
them around your neck.
Prov
6:22  When you are walking about, it
leads you; When you lie down, it guards you. And when you have woken up, It
talks to you.
Prov
6:23  For the command is a lamp, And the
Torah a light, And reproofs of discipline a way of life,
Prov
6:24  To guard you against an evil woman,
From the flattering tongue of a strange woman.
Prov
6:25  Do not desire her prettiness in
your heart, Neither let her captivate you with her eyelids.
Prov
6:26  For because of a whore One is brought to a crust of bread. And
an adulteress hunts a precious life.
Prov
6:27  Would a man take fire to his bosom,
And his garments not be burned?
Prov
6:28  Would a man walk on hot coals, And
his feet not be scorched?
Prov
6:29  So is he who goes in to his
neighbour’s wife; None who touches her goes unpunished.
Prov
6:30  They do not despise a thief If he
steals to satisfy his appetite when he is starving.
Prov
6:31  Yet if he is caught he repays
sevenfold; He gives all the wealth of his house.
Prov
6:32  He who commits adultery with a
woman lacks heart; He who does it destroys his own life.
Prov
6:33  He finds smiting and shame, And his
reproach is not wiped away.
Prov
6:34  For jealousy enrages a man, And he
does not spare in the day of vengeance.
Prov
6:35  He does not regard any ransom, Nor
accept your bribe, however great!
Prov
7:1  My son, guard my words, And treasure
up my commands with you.
Prov
7:2  Guard my commands and live, And my
Torah as the apple of your eye.
Prov
7:3  Bind them on your fingers; Write
them on the tablet of your heart.
Prov
7:4  Say to wisdom, “You are my sister,”
And call understanding a close friend,
Prov
7:5  To guard you against the strange
woman, Against the foreigner who flatters with her words.
Prov
7:6  For at the window of my house I
looked through my lattice,
Prov
7:7  And I saw among the simple, I
perceived among the youths, A young man lacking heart,
Prov
7:8  Passing through the street near her
corner; And he went the way to her house
Prov
7:9  In the twilight, in the evening, In
the black and dark night.
Prov
7:10  And look, a woman met him, Dressed
like a whore, With a hidden heart.
Prov
7:11  She was boisterous and stubborn,
Her feet did not stay at her own house.
Prov
7:12  Now in the street, Now in the
square, And at every corner she lurks.
Prov
7:13  And she took hold of him and kissed
him; She hardened her face and said to him:
Prov
7:14  “Peace offerings are with me; Today
I have paid my vows.
Prov
7:15  “Therefore I came out to meet you,
To earnestly seek your face, and I found you.
Prov
7:16  “I have spread my bed with coverings,
Coloured linens of Mitsrayim.
Prov
7:17  “I have sprinkled my bed with
myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. 
Prov
7:18  “Come, let us take our fill of love
until morning; Let us delight ourselves with love.
Prov
7:19  “For my husband is not at home; He
has gone on a long journey;
Prov
7:20  “He took a bag of silver with him;
He comes home on the day of the new moon.”
Prov
7:21  With her many words she leads him
astray, With her smooth lips she seduces him.
Prov
7:22  He goes after her immediately, Like
an ox he goes to the slaughter, And as in chains, a fool to the punishment,
Prov
7:23  Till an arrow strikes through his
liver; Like a bird rushing into a snare, And did not know it would take his
life.
Prov
7:24  And now, listen to me, you
children; Pay attention to the words of my mouth:
Prov
7:25  Do not let your heart turn aside to
her ways, Do not go astray in her paths.
Prov
7:26  For many are the wounded she has
caused to fall, And numerous all her slain ones.
Prov
7:27  Her house is the way to the grave,
Going down to the rooms of death.
Prov
8:1  Does not wisdom call, And
understanding lift up her voice?
Prov
8:2  On the top of the heights along the
way, Between the paths she has taken her stand.
Prov
8:3  Beside the gates, leading to the
city, At the entrances, she shouts:
Prov
8:4  “O men, I call, to you, And my voice
is to the sons of men.
Prov
8:5  “You simple ones, understand
insight, And you fools, be of an understanding heart.
Prov
8:6  “Listen, for I speak noble words,
And the opening of my lips is about straightness;
Prov
8:7  “For my mouth speaks truth; And
wrongness is an abomination to my lips.
Prov
8:8  “All the words of my mouth are in
righteousness, None of them twisted or crooked,
Prov
8:9  “All of them plain to him who
understands, And straight to those who find knowledge.
Prov
8:10  “Accept my discipline, and not
silver, And knowledge rather than choice gold;
Prov
8:11  “For wisdom is better than rubies,
And all delights are not comparable to her.
Prov
8:12  “I, wisdom, have dwelt with
insight, And I find knowledge, foresight.
Prov
8:13  “The fear of יהוה
is to hate evil. I have hated pride and arrogance, And the evil way, And the
perverse mouth.
Prov
8:14  “Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom;
I am understanding, mightiness is mine.
Prov
8:15  “By me sovereigns reign, And rulers
make righteous decrees.
Prov
8:16  “By me princes rule, and nobles,
All the judges of the earth.
Prov
8:17  “I love those who love me, And
those who earnestly seek me do find me.
Prov
8:18  “Riches and esteem are with me,
Enduring wealth and righteousness.
Prov
8:19  “My fruit is better than gold and
fine gold, And my increase than choice silver.
Prov
8:20  “I walk in the way of
righteousness, In the midst of the paths of right- ruling,
Prov
8:21  “To bestow substance on those who
love me, And to fill their treasuries.
Prov
8:22  “ יהוה
possessed me, The beginning of His way, As the first of His works of old.
Prov
8:23  “I was set up ages ago, at the
first, Before the earth ever was.
Prov
8:24  “When there were no depths I was
brought forth, When there were no springs heavy with water.
Prov
8:25  “Before mountains were sunk, Before
the hills, I was brought forth,
Prov
8:26  “Before He had made the earth and
the fields, Or the first dust of the world.
Prov
8:27  “When He prepared the heavens, I
was there, When He decreed a vault on the face of the deep,
Prov
8:28  “When He set the clouds above, When
He made the fountains of the deep strong,
Prov
8:29  “When He gave to the sea its limit,
So that the waters would not transgress His command, When He decreed the
foundations of the earth,
Prov
8:30  “Then I was beside Him, a master
workman, And I was His delight, day
by day Rejoicing before Him all the time,
Prov
8:31  “Rejoicing in the world, His earth;
And my delights were with the sons of men.
Prov
8:32  “And now, listen to me, you
children, For blessed are they who guard my ways.
Prov
8:33  “Listen to discipline and become
wise, And do not refuse it.
Prov
8:34  “Blessed is the man who listens to
me, Watching daily at my gates, Waiting at the posts of my doors.
Prov
8:35  “For whoever finds me shall find
life, And obtain favour from יהוה,
Prov
8:36  “But he who sins against me injures
himself; All who hate me love death!”
Prov
9:1  Wisdom has built her house, She has
hewn out its seven columns,
Prov
9:2  She has slaughtered her meat, She
has mixed her wine, She has also prepared her table.
Prov
9:3  She has sent out her young women,
She cries out from the highest places of the city:
Prov
9:4  “Who is simple? Let him turn in
here!” As for him who lacks heart, she says to him,
Prov
9:5  “Come, eat of my bread and drink of
the wine I have mixed.” 
Prov
9:6  Leave the simple ones and live, And
walk in the way of understanding.
Prov
9:7  He who reproves a scoffer gets shame
for himself, And he who rebukes a wrong one gets himself a blemish.
Prov
9:8  Do not reprove a scoffer, lest he
hate you; Reprove a wise one, and he loves you.
Prov
9:9  Give instruction to a wise one, and he is wiser still; Teach a righteous
one, and he increases in learning.
Prov
9:10  The fear of יהוה
is the beginning of wisdom, And the knowledge of the Set-apart One is
understanding.
Prov
9:11  For by me your days become many,
And years of life are added to you.
Prov
9:12  If you have become wise, You have
become wise for yourself, And if you have scoffed, You alone bear it.
Prov
9:13  A foolish woman is loud, Simple,
and without knowledge.
Prov
9:14  For she has seated herself At the
door of her house, On a seat by the highest places of the city,
Prov
9:15  To call to those who pass by, Who
go straight on their way:
Prov
9:16  “Who is simple? Let him turn in
here.” And as for him who lacks heart, she says to him,
Prov
9:17  “Stolen waters are sweet, And bread
eaten in secret is pleasant.”
Prov
9:18  But he does not know that the dead
are there, Her guests are in the depths of the grave.
Prov
10:1  Proverbs of Shelomoh: A wise son
makes a father rejoice, But a foolish son is his mother’s sorrow.
Prov
10:2  Treasures of wrongness are of no
value, But righteousness delivers from death.
Prov
10:3  יהוה does
not let the being of the righteous go hungry, But He thrusts away the desire of
the wrong.
Prov
10:4  Poor is he who works with a lazy
hand, But the hand of the hard worker makes rich.
Prov
10:5  He who gathers in summer is a wise
son, He who sleeps in harvest is a son who causes shame.
Prov
10:6  Blessings are on the head of the
righteous, But violence covers the mouth of the wrong.
Prov
10:7  The remembrance of the righteous is

18:14  The spirit of a man sustains him
in sickness, But who does bear a broken spirit?
Prov
18:15  The heart of the understanding one
gets knowledge, And the ear of the wise seeks knowledge.
Prov
18:16  A man’s gift makes room for him,
And brings him before great men.
Prov
18:17  The first to state his own case,
seems right, Until another comes and
examines him.
Prov
18:18  The lot settles disputes, And
separates between the mighty.
Prov
18:19  A brother transgressed against is
a strong city, And contentions are like the bars of a citadel.
Prov
18:20  A man’s stomach is satisfied From
the fruit of his mouth; He is satisfied with
the increase of his lips.
Prov
18:21  Death and life are in the power of
the tongue, And those loving it eat its fruit.
Prov
18:22  He who has found a wife has found
good, And receives favour from יהוה.
Prov
18:23  The poor speaks beseechingly, But
the rich answers fiercely.
Prov
18:24  A man of many friends might come to ruin, But there is a Loving One Who
sticks closer than a brother!
Prov
19:1  Better is the poor walking in his
integrity Than one of perverse lips, who is a fool.
Prov
19:2  Also, desire without knowledge is
not good; And he who hurries with his feet sins.
Prov
19:3  The foolishness of a man perverts
his way, And his heart is wroth against יהוה.
Prov
19:4  Wealth adds many friends, But the
poor is separated from his friend.
Prov
19:5  A false witness does not go
unpunished, And he who breaths out lies does not escape.
Prov
19:6  Many entreat the favour of the
noble. And all are friends to him who gives gifts.
Prov
19:7  All the brothers of the poor shall
hate him; How much more shall his friends go far from him! He pursues promises –
they are gone!.
Prov
19:8  He who gets heart loves his own
life; He who guards understanding finds good.
Prov
19:9  A false witness does not go
unpunished, And he who breathes out lies perishes.
Prov
19:10  Luxury is not fitting for a fool,
Much less for a servant to rule over princes.
Prov
19:11  A man’s discretion makes him
patient, And his adorning is to pass over a transgression.
Prov
19:12  The sovereign’s wrath is like the
roaring of a lion, But his delight is like dew on the grass.
Prov
19:13  A foolish son is a calamity to his
father, And the contentions of a wife are a continual dripping.
Prov
19:14  Houses and riches are the
inheritance from fathers, But an understanding wife is from יהוה.
Prov
19:15  Laziness makes one fall into a
deep sleep, And an idle being suffers hunger.
Prov
19:16  He who guards the command guards
his life, He who despises His ways dies.
Prov
19:17  He who shows favour to the poor
lends to יהוה, And He repays his deed.
Prov
19:18  Discipline your son because there
is expectation, And do not set your being on his destruction.
Prov
19:19  One of great wrath bears
punishment; For if you rescue him,
You only have to do it again.
Prov
19:20  Listen to counsel and accept
discipline, So that you are wise in your latter end.
Prov
19:21  Many are the plans in a man’s
heart, But it is the counsel of יהוה that stands.
Prov
19:22  What is desirable in a man is his
kindness, And a poor man is better than a liar.
Prov
19:23  The fear of יהוה
leads to life, And he remains
satisfied, He is not visited by evil.
Prov
19:24  A lazy one buries his hand in a
dish, And does not bring it back to his mouth.
Prov
19:25  Beat a scoffer, and the simple is
made wise; And reprove one who has understanding, And he discerns knowledge.
Prov
19:26  He who plunders a father, Chases
away his mother, Is a son causing shame and bringing reproach.
Prov
19:27  Cease, my son, to hear discipline,
And you shall stray from the words of
knowledge.
Prov
19:28  A witness of Beliya‛al
scorns right-ruling, And the mouth of the wrong ones Devours wickedness.
Prov
19:29  Judgments are in store for
scoffers, And beatings for the backs of fools.
Prov
20:1  Wine is a scoffer, strong drink a
brawler, And whoever is led astray by it is not wise.
Prov
20:2  The dread of a sovereign is like
the roaring of a lion; Whoever provokes him sins against his own life.
Prov
20:3  For a man to cease from strife is
esteem, But every fool bursts out.
Prov
20:4  The lazy one does not plough after
the autumn; At harvest time he inquires – there is none!
Prov
20:5  Counsel in the heart of man is like
deep water, But a man of understanding draws it up.
Prov
20:6  Most men proclaim each his own
kindness, But who finds a trustworthy man?
Prov
20:7  The righteous man walks in his
integrity; His children are blessed after him.
Prov
20:8  A sovereign who sits on the throne
of judgment Is scattering all evil with his eyes.
Prov
20:9  Who says, “I have cleansed my
heart, I am purged of my sin”?
Prov
20:10  Differing weights and differing
measures, Both of them are an abomination to יהוה.
Prov
20:11  Even a child is known by his
deeds, Whether his work is clear and right.
Prov
20:12  The hearing ear and the seeing
eye, יהוה has made both of them.
Prov
20:13  Do not love sleep, lest you become
poor; Open your eyes, be satisfied with bread.
Prov
20:14  “Evil! Evil!” cries the buyer; But
when he has gone his way, then he boasts.
Prov
20:15  There is gold and a multitude of
rubies, But the lips of knowledge are a precious vessel.
Prov
20:16  Take the garment of one who is
guarantor for a stranger, And hold it as a pledge when it is for foreigners.
Prov
20:17  Bread gained by deceit might be
sweet to a man, But afterward his mouth is filled with gravel.
Prov
20:18  By counsel plans are established;
And by wise guidance wage a battle.
Prov
20:19  He who goes about as a slanderer
reveals secrets; Therefore do not associate with him Who speaks smoothly with his
lips.
Prov
20:20  Whoever curses his father or his
mother, His lamp is put out in deep darkness.
Prov
20:21  An inheritance obtained with greed
at the beginning Is not blessed at the end.
Prov
20:22  Do not say, “I repay evil.” Wait
for יהוה, and He saves you.
Prov
20:23  Differing weights are an
abomination to יהוה, And a false scale is not good.
Prov
20:24  The steps of a man are from יהוה
; What does a man know about his own way?
Prov
20:25  It is a snare for a man to say
rashly, “It is set-apart,” And only later to reconsider his vows.
Prov
20:26  A wise sovereign winnows out the
wrong, And turns the wheel over them.
Prov
20:27  The spirit of a man is the lamp of
יהוה, Searching all his inmost parts.
Prov
20:28  Kindness and truth watch over the
sovereign, And he shall support his throne by kindness.
Prov
20:29  The comeliness of young men is
their strength, And the splendour of old men is their grey hair.
Prov
20:30  The blows that wound cleanse away
evil, And strokes the inner parts of the heart.
Prov
21:1  The sovereign’s heart is as
channels of water In the hand of יהוה ; He turns it
wherever He wishes.
Prov
21:2  All a man’s ways are right in his
own eyes, But יהוה weighs the hearts.
Prov
21:3  To do righteousness and
right-ruling Is more acceptable to יהוה than a
slaughtering.
Prov
21:4  A haughty look, a proud heart, The
lamp of the wrong, are sin.
Prov
21:5  The plans of the hard worker lead only to plenty, But all rash haste
only to poverty.
Prov
21:6  Gaining treasures by a lying tongue
Is a fleeting vapour, heading for death.
Prov
21:7  The spoil of the wrong catches
them, Because they refused to do right- ruling.
Prov
21:8  The way of a guilty man is
perverse; But as for the innocent, his work is right.
Prov
21:9  It is better to dwell in a corner
of a roof, Than in a house shared with a contentious woman.
Prov
21:10  The desire of the wrong is set
upon evil; His neighbour finds no favour in his eyes.
Prov
21:11  When the scoffer is punished, the
simple is made wise; But when the wise is instructed, he receives knowledge.
Prov
21:12  The Righteous One observes the
house of the wrong; He overthrows the wrong for their evil.
Prov
21:13  Whoever shuts his ears to the cry
of the poor, Let him also cry and not be heard.
Prov
21:14  A gift in secret subdues
displeasure, And a bribe in the bosom, strong wrath.
Prov
21:15  To do right-ruling is joy to the
righteous, But ruin to the workers of wickedness.
Prov
21:16  A man who strays from the way of
understanding, Rests in the assembly of the dead.
Prov
21:17  He who loves pleasure is a poor
man; He who loves wine and oil does not become rich.
Prov
21:18  The wrong is a ransom for the
righteous, And the treacherous for the straight.
Prov
21:19  It is better to dwell in the
wilderness, Than with a contentious and vexed woman.
Prov
21:20  Desirable treasure and oil, Are in
the dwelling of the wise, But a foolish man swallows it up.
Prov
21:21  He who pursues righteousness and
kindness Finds life, righteousness and esteem.
Prov
21:22  A wise one scales the city of the
mighty, And brings down the trusted stronghold.
Prov
21:23  Whoever guards his mouth and
tongue Guards his life from distresses.
Prov
21:24  Proud, haughty, “Scoffer” is his
name; He acts with arrogant pride.
Prov
21:25  The desire of the lazy man slays
him, For his hands refused to work.
Prov
21:26  He covets greedily all day long,
But the righteous gives and does not withhold.
Prov
21:27  The slaughtering of the wrong is
an abomination; How much more when he brings it with wickedness!
Prov
21:28  A false witness perishes, But the
man who obeys speaks forever.
Prov
21:29  A wrong man hardens his face, But
as for the straight, he establishes his way.
Prov
21:30  There is no wisdom or
understanding Or counsel against יהוה.
Prov
21:31  The horse is prepared for the day
of battle, But the deliverance is of יהוה.
Prov
22:1  A good name is preferable to great riches. Favour is better than
silver and gold.
Prov
22:2  The rich and the poor meet together
– יהוה is the Maker of them all.
Prov
22:3  A clever one foresees evil and
hides himself, But the simple go on and are punished.
Prov
22:4  The reward of humility is the fear
of יהוה, Riches, and esteem and life.
Prov
22:5  Thorns, snares are in the way of
the perverse; He who guards his life keeps far away from them.
Prov
22:6  Train up a child in the way he
should go, Even when he is old he turns not away from it.
Prov
22:7  The rich rules over the poor, And
the borrower is servant to the lender.
Prov
22:8  He who sows unrighteousness reaps
trouble, And the rod of his wrath perishes.
Prov
22:9  He who has a good eye is blessed,
For he gives of his bread to the poor.
Prov
22:10  Cast out the scoffer and strife
goes out, And contention and shame cease.
Prov
22:11  He who loves cleanness of heart,
Whose speech is pleasant, A sovereign is his friend.
Prov
22:12  The eyes of יהוה
shall watch over knowledge, But He overthrows the words of the treacherous.
Prov
22:13  The lazy one says, “There is a
lion outside! I am going to be killed in the streets!”
Prov
22:14  The mouth of a strange woman is a
deep pit; The one denounced by יהוה falls in there.
Prov
22:15  Folly is bound up in the heart of
a child; The rod of discipline drives it far from him.
Prov
22:16  One oppresses the poor to increase
his wealth, Another gives to the
rich, only to come to poverty.
Prov
22:17  Incline your ear and hear the
words of the wise, And apply your heart to my knowledge;
Prov
22:18  For they are pleasant If you guard
them within you; Let all of them be ready on your lips.
Prov
22:19  I caused you to know today, even
you:
Prov
22:20  Have I not previously written to
you Of counsels and knowledge,
Prov
22:21  To cause you to know The certainty
of the words of truth, To return words of truth to those who send to you?
Prov
22:22  Do not rob the poor because he is
poor, And oppress not the afflicted at the gate.
Prov
22:23  For יהוה
pleads their cause, And shall plunder those who plunder them.
Prov
22:24  Make no friendship with one given
to wrath, And do not go with a man of rage,
Prov
22:25  Lest you learn his ways, And find
yourself ensnared.
Prov
22:26  Do not be one of those who shakes
hands in a pledge, One of those who are guarantors for debts.
Prov
22:27  If you do not have the means to
pay, Why should he take away your bed from under you?
Prov
22:28  Do not move the ancient boundary
Which your fathers have set.
Prov
22:29  Do you see a man who is skilled in
his work? He does stand before sovereigns, He does not stand before obscure
ones.
Prov
23:1  When you sit down to eat with a
ruler, Look well what is before you;
Prov
23:2  And put a knife to your throat If
you are a man given to appetite.
Prov
23:3  Do not desire his delicacies, For
that food is deceptive.
Prov
23:4  Do not labour to be rich. Cease
from your own understanding!
Prov
23:5  Do you set your eyes on that which
is not? For riches certainly make themselves wings; They fly away like an eagle
to the heavens.
Prov
23:6  Do not eat the bread of one having an evil eye, Nor desire his
delicacies;
Prov
23:7  For as he reckons in his life, so
is he. “Eat and drink!” he says to you, But his heart is not with you.
Prov
23:8  You vomit the piece you have eaten,
And lose your sweet words.
Prov
23:9  Do not speak in the ears of a fool,
For he treads on the wisdom of your words.
Prov
23:10  Do not move the ancient boundary,
And do not enter the fields of the fatherless;
Prov
23:11  For their Redeemer is strong; He
shall plead their cause against you.
Prov
23:12  Bring your heart to discipline,
And your ears to words of knowledge.
Prov
23:13  Do not withhold discipline from a
child; If you beat him with a rod, he does not die.
Prov
23:14  Beat him with a rod And deliver
his being from the grave.
Prov
23:15  My son, if your heart shall be
wise, My heart rejoices, even I,
Prov
23:16  And my kidneys exult When your
lips speak what is straight.
Prov
23:17  Do not let your heart envy
sinners, But be in the fear of יהוה all day long;
Prov
23:18  For certain, there is a hereafter,
And let your expectancy not be cut off.
Prov
23:19  Hear, my son, and be wise, And
guide your heart in the way.
Prov
23:20  Be not among heavy drinkers of
wine Or with gluttonous eaters of meat;
Prov
23:21  For the drunkard and the glutton
become poor, And slumber puts rags on a
man.
Prov
23:22  Listen to your father who brought
you forth, And do not despise your mother when she is old.
Prov
23:23  Buy the truth and do not sell it –
Wisdom and discipline and understanding.
Prov
23:24  The father of the righteous
greatly rejoices, And he who brings forth a wise one delights in him.
Prov
23:25  Let your father and your mother
rejoice, And let her who bore you exult.
Prov
23:26  My son, give me your heart, And
let your eyes watch my ways.
Prov
23:27  For a whore is a deep pit, And a
strange woman is a narrow well.
Prov
23:28  She too lies in wait as for a
prey, And increases the treacherous among men.
Prov
23:29  Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who
has contentions? Who has complaints? Who feels hurt without cause? Who has
redness of eyes?
Prov
23:30  Those staying long at the wine,
Those going in to search out mixed wine.
Prov
23:31  Do not look on the wine when it is
red, When it gives its colour in the cup, As it flows smoothly;
Prov
23:32  In the end it bites like a snake,
And stings like an adder –
Prov
23:33  Your eyes look on strange women,
And your heart speaks perversities.
Prov
23:34  And you shall be as one Lying down
in the midst of the sea, And as one lying at the top of the mast, saying,
Prov
23:35  “They smote me, I was not sick!
They beat me, I did not know! When shall I wake up? Let me seek it again!”
Prov
24:1  Do not envy evil men, Nor desire to
be with them;
Prov
24:2  For their heart plots to ravage,
And their lips talk of trouble.
Prov
24:3  By wisdom a house is built, And by
understanding it is established;
Prov
24:4  And by knowledge the rooms are
filled With all precious and pleasant riches.
Prov
24:5  Mighty is the wise in strength, And
a man of knowledge strengthens power;
Prov
24:6  For by wise guidance you wage your
own battle, And delivery is by a great counsellor.
Prov
24:7  Wisdom is high for a fool; He does
not open his mouth in the gate.
Prov
24:8  He who plots to do evil Is called a
master of evil plots.
Prov
24:9  The purpose of folly is sin, And
the scoffer is an abomination to men.
Prov
24:10  If you falter in the day of
distress, Your strength is small!
Prov
24:11  Deliver those taken to death, And
hold back those stumbling to the slaughter,
Prov
24:12  If you say, “See, we did not know
this,” Would not He who weighs the hearts discern it? He who watches over your
life, Would He not know it? And shall He not repay man according to his work?
Prov
24:13  My son, eat honey, for it is good,
And the honeycomb, sweet to your taste;
Prov
24:14  Know that wisdom is thus to your
being; If you have found it, there is a future, And your expectancy is not cut
off.
Prov
24:15  Do not lie in wait, O wrong one,
Against the dwelling of the righteous; Do not ravage his resting place;
Prov
24:16  For seven times a righteous man
falls and rises, But the wrong one stumbles into evil.
Prov
24:17  Do not exult when your enemy
falls, And let not your heart rejoice when he stumbles;
Prov
24:18  Lest יהוה
see and it be evil in His eyes, And He turn away His wrath from him.
Prov
24:19  Do not fret because of evil-doers,
And do not envy the wrong;
Prov
24:20  For there is no future for the
evil-doer; The lamp of the wrongdoers is put out.
Prov
24:21  My son, fear יהוה
and the sovereign; Do not mingle with those who change;
Prov
24:22  For their calamity arises
suddenly, And who knows the ruin of both of them?
Prov
24:23  These also are for the wise: It is
not good to show partiality in right-ruling.
Prov
24:24  He who says to the wrong, “You are
righteous” – peoples curse him, Nations despise him.
Prov
24:25  But those who rebuke the wrong, It is pleasant, and a good
blessing comes on them.
Prov
24:26  He who gives a right answer kisses
the lips. 
Prov
24:27  Prepare your outside work, And
make it fit for yourself in the field; Then you shall build your house.
Prov
24:28  Do not witness against your
neighbour without cause, And do not deceive with your lips.
Prov
24:29  Do not say, “Let me do to him as
he did to me; I repay each according to his work.”
Prov
24:30  I passed by the field of the lazy,
And by the vineyard of the man lacking heart;
Prov
24:31  And see, it was all overgrown with
thorns; Its surface was covered with nettles; And its stone wall was broken
down.
Prov
24:32  When I saw it, I set my heart on
it; I looked and received discipline:
Prov
24:33  A little sleep, a little slumber,
A little folding of the hands to rest;
Prov
24:34  And your poverty shall come, a
prowler, And your need like an armed man.
Prov
25:1  These too are proverbs of Shelomoh
which the men of Ḥizqiyah sovereign of Yehuḏah copied:
Prov
25:2  It is the esteem of Elohim to hide
a matter, And the esteem of sovereigns to search out a matter.
Prov
25:3  The heavens for height and the
earth for depth, But the heart of sovereigns is unsearchable.
Prov
25:4  Take away the dross from silver,
And a vessel comes forth for the refiner.
Prov
25:5  Take away the wrong from before the
sovereign, And his throne is established in righteousness.
Prov
25:6  Do not exalt yourself before a
sovereign, And do not stand in the place of great men;
Prov
25:7  For it is better for him to say to
you, “Come up here,” Than that you should be put lower Before a noble whom your
eyes have seen.
Prov
25:8  Do not go forth to strive in haste,
For what would you do in the end, When your neighbour has put you to shame?
Prov
25:9  Plead your case with your neighbour
himself, And do not disclose the secret of another;
Prov
25:10  Lest he who hears it put you to
shame, And your evil report turn not back.
Prov
25:11  A word spoken at the right time Is
like apples of gold in settings of silver.
Prov
25:12  A ring of gold, and an ornament of
fine gold, Is a wise one’s reproof to an ear that hears.
Prov
25:13  Like the cold of snow in time of
harvest Is a trustworthy messenger to those who send him, For he refreshes the
life of his masters.
Prov
25:14  He who boasts of his gifts falsely
Is like clouds and wind without rain.
Prov
25:15  Through patience a ruler is
persuaded, And a soft tongue shatters a bone.
Prov
25:16  Have you found honey? Eat only as
much as you need, Lest you be satisfied with it and vomit.
Prov
25:17  Make your foot rare in your
neighbour’s house, Lest he gets enough of you and hate you.
Prov
25:18  A man bearing false witness
against his neighbour Is like a club
and a sword and a sharp arrow.
Prov
25:19  Trust in a treacherous man in time
of distress Is like a broken tooth or
a foot out of joint.
Prov
25:20  One who takes away a garment in
cold weather, Is like vinegar on
soda, And a singer of songs on an evil heart.
Prov
25:21  If your enemy is hungry give him
bread to eat, And if he is thirsty give him water to drink,
Prov
25:22  For you are heaping coals of fire
on his head, And יהוה rewards you.
Prov
25:23  The north wind brings rain, And a
secret tongue an enraged face.
Prov
25:24  It is better to dwell in a corner
of a roof, Than in a house shared with a contentious woman.
Prov
25:25  Like cold water to a parched throat, Is good news from a distant
land.
Prov
25:26  A righteous man who gives way before
the wrong, Is like a muddied spring
and a ruined fountain.
Prov
25:27  It is not good to eat much honey.
Is it esteem to seek one’s own esteem?
Prov
25:28  A man who has no control over his
spirit Is like a broken-down city
without a wall.
Prov
26:1  Like snow in summer, and rain in
harvest, So esteem is not fitting for a fool.
Prov
26:2  As a bird wanders, as a swallow
flies about, So a curse without cause does not come.
Prov
26:3  A whip for a horse, a bridle for a
donkey, And a rod for the fool’s back.
Prov
26:4  Do not answer a fool according to
his folly, Lest you also become like him.
Prov
26:5  Answer a fool according to his
folly, Lest he become wise in his own eyes.
Prov
26:6  He who sends a message by the hand
of a fool Cuts off feet, drinks damage.
Prov
26:7  The legs of the lame hang limp So
is a proverb in the mouth of fools.
Prov
26:8  Like one binding a stone in a
sling, So is he who gives esteem to a fool.
Prov
26:9  A thorn goes into the hand of a
drunkard So is a proverb in the mouth of fools.
Prov
26:10  An archer who wounds anyone, Is he
who hires a fool or any passer-by.
Prov
26:11  As a dog returns to his own vomit,
So a fool repeats his folly.
Prov
26:12  Have you seen a man wise in his
own eyes? There is more expectancy for a fool than for him.
Prov
26:13  The lazy one says, “There is a
lion in the way! A fierce lion is in the streets!”
Prov
26:14  As a door turns on its hinges, So does the lazy one turn on his
bed.
Prov
26:15  The lazy one buries his hand in a
dish; It tires him to bring it back to his mouth.
Prov
26:16  The lazy one is wiser in his own
eyes Than seven rendering advice.
Prov
26:17  A passer-by meddling in a strife
not his own Is like one who takes a
dog by the ears.
Prov
26:18  Like a madman who throws sparks,
arrows, and death, 
Prov
26:19  So is a man who deceived his
neighbour, And says, “I was only joking!”
Prov
26:20  For lack of wood, the fire goes
out. And without a slanderer, strife ceases.
Prov
26:21  As charcoal is to burning coals, and wood to fire, So is a
contentious man to kindle strife.
Prov
26:22  The words of a slanderer are as
dainty morsels, Which go down into the inner parts of the heart.
Prov
26:23  Burning lips with an evil heart Are like earthenware covered with silver
dross.
Prov
26:24  He who hates, pretends with his
lips, And lays up deceit within him;
Prov
26:25  Though he speaks kindly, do not
believe him, For there are seven abominations in his heart.
Prov
26:26  Hatred is covered by deceit. His
evil is disclosed in the assembly.
Prov
26:27  Whoever digs a pit falls into it,
And whoever rolls a stone, it turns back on him.
Prov
26:28  A lying tongue hates its bruised
ones, And a flattering mouth works ruin.
Prov
27:1  Do not boast of tomorrow, For you
do not know what a day brings forth.
Prov
27:2  Let another man praise you, And not
your own mouth – A stranger, and not your own lips.
Prov
27:3  A stone is heavy and sand is
weighty, But a fool’s wrath is heavier than both.
Prov
27:4  Wrath is cruel and displeasure
overwhelming, But who is able to stand before jealousy?
Prov
27:5  Open reproof is better than hidden
love. 
Prov
27:6  The wounds of a friend are true,
But the kisses of an enemy are profuse.
Prov
27:7  One satisfied loathes the
honeycomb, But to a hungry one any bitter food
is sweet.
Prov
27:8  Like a bird that wanders from its
nest, So is a man who wanders from his place.
Prov
27:9  Ointment and perfume gladden the
heart, So one’s counsel is sweet to his friend.
Prov
27:10  Do not forsake your own friend or
your father’s friend, And do not go into your brother’s house In the day of
your calamity – Better is a neighbour nearby than a brother far away.
Prov
27:11  My son, be wise, and gladden my
heart, That I might have a word for him who reproaches me.
Prov
27:12  A clever man foresees calamity,
hides himself; The simple shall go on, they are punished.
Prov
27:13  Take the garment of him who is
guarantor for a stranger, And for a strange woman pledge it.
Prov
27:14  He who greets his friend loudly
early in the morning, Shall have it reckoned to him as a curse.
Prov
27:15  Drops that never cease on a very
rainy day And a contentious woman are alike;
Prov
27:16  Whoever represses her represses
the wind, And his right hand encounters oil.
Prov
27:17  Iron is sharpened by iron, And a
man sharpens the face of his friend.
Prov
27:18  He who tends the fig tree eats its
fruit; And he who guards his master is esteemed.
Prov
27:19  As in water face reflects face, So a man’s heart reflects a man.
Prov
27:20  The grave and destruction are not
satisfied; So the eyes of man are not satisfied.
Prov
27:21  A refining pot is for silver and a
furnace for gold, So a man is tried
by his praise.
Prov
27:22  Even if you pound a fool in a
mortar with a pestle Along with crushed grain, His folly shall not leave him.
Prov
27:23  Know well the state of your
flocks; Set your heart to your herds;
Prov
27:24  For riches are not forever, Nor a
diadem to all generations.
Prov
27:25  Grass vanishes, and new grass
appears, And the vegetation of the mountains are gathered in.
Prov
27:26  The lambs are for your garments,
And the goats for the price of a field;
Prov
27:27  And goats’ milk enough for your
food, For the food of your household, And sustenance for your girls.
Prov
28:1  The wrong shall flee though no one
pursues, But the righteous are as bold as a lion.
Prov
28:2  Because of transgression of a land,
Many are its rulers; But by a man of understanding and knowledge, Right is
maintained.
Prov
28:3  A poor man who oppresses the poor Is like a sweeping rain that leaves no
food.
Prov
28:4  Those who forsake the Torah praise
the wrong, Those who guard the Torah strive with them.
Prov
28:5  Evil men do not understand
right-ruling, But those who seek יהוה understand all.
Prov
28:6  Better is the poor who walks in his
integrity Than one perverse in his ways, who is rich.
Prov
28:7  He who watches over the Torah is a
discerning son, But a companion of gluttons shames his father.
Prov
28:8  He who increases his possessions by
interest and profit Gathers it for him who shows favour to the poor.
Prov
28:9  He who turns away his ear from
hearing the Torah, Even his prayer is an abomination.
Prov
28:10  He who causes the straight to go
astray in an evil way, Falls into his own pit; But the perfect inherit the
good.
Prov
28:11  A rich man is wise in his own
eyes, But the poor who has understanding searches him out.
Prov
28:12  When the righteous exult, there is
great comeliness; But when the wrong arise, a man is searched for.
Prov
28:13  He who hides his transgressions
does not prosper, But he who confesses and forsakes them finds compassion.
Prov
28:14  Blessed is the man who always
fears Elohim, But he who hardens his
heart falls into evil.
Prov
28:15  A roaring lion and a charging bear
Is a wrongdoing ruler over poor people.
Prov
28:16  A leader who lacks understanding
is a great oppressor, But the hater of greed prolongs his days.
Prov
28:17  A man oppressed by blood-guilt
flees into a pit; Let no one help him.
Prov
28:18  He who walks blamelessly is saved,
But the perverted of ways falls at once.
Prov
28:19  He who tills his land is satisfied
with bread, But he who pursues vanities is filled with poverty.
Prov
28:20  A man of truth has many blessings,
But one in a hurry to be rich does not go unpunished.
Prov
28:21  To show partiality is not good,
Because for a piece of bread a man would transgress.
Prov
28:22  A man with an evil eye runs after
wealth, And does not know that poverty awaits him.
Prov
28:23  He who reproves a man finds more
favour afterward Than he who flatters with the tongue.
Prov
28:24  He who robs his father or his
mother, And says, “It is no transgression,” He is a companion to a destroyer.
Prov
28:25  He who is greedy stirs up strife,
But he who trusts in יהוה prospers.
Prov
28:26  He who trusts in his own heart is
a fool, But he who walks wisely is delivered.
Prov
28:27  He who gives to the poor does not
lack, But he who hides his eyes does have many curses.
Prov
28:28  When the wrong rise up, men hide
themselves; But when they perish, the righteous increase.
Prov
29:1  One often reproved, hardening his
neck, Is suddenly broken, and there is no healing.
Prov
29:2  When the righteous increase, the
people rejoice; But when a wrong one rules, the people sigh.
Prov
29:3  He who loves wisdom gladdens his
father, But a companion of whores destroys wealth.
Prov
29:4  A sovereign establishes a land by
right-ruling, But one who receives bribes throws it down.
Prov
29:5  A man who flatters his neighbour
Spreads a net for his own feet.
Prov
29:6  An evil man is ensnared by
transgression, But the righteous sings and rejoices.
Prov
29:7  The righteous knows the plea of the
poor, The wrong does not understand such
knowledge.
Prov
29:8  Scoffers ensnare a city, But the
wise turn away wrath.
Prov
29:9  When a wise man disputes with a
foolish man, Whether he rages or laughs, there is no peace.
Prov
29:10  Bloodthirsty men hate the perfect,
And seek the life of the straight.
Prov
29:11  A fool lets out all his breath,
But the wise calms it down.
Prov
29:12  If a ruler listens to lying words,
All his servants become wrong.
Prov
29:13  The poor man and the oppressor
have this in common: יהוה gives light to the eyes of
both.
Prov
29:14  The sovereign who rightly rules
the poor with truth, His throne is established forever.
Prov
29:15  A rod and reproof give wisdom, But
a child unrestrained brings shame to his mother.
Prov
29:16  When the wrong become many,
transgression increases; But the righteous look on their fall.
Prov
29:17  Discipline your son, And he brings
you rest and delight to your life.
Prov
29:18  Where there is no vision, the
people are let loose, But blessed is he who guards the Torah.
Prov
29:19  A servant is not disciplined by
words; Though he understands, he does not respond.
Prov
29:20  Have you seen a man hasty in his
words? There is more expectancy for a fool than for him.
Prov
29:21  He who deals tenderly With his
servant from youth, Has him as a son in the end.
Prov
29:22  A man of displeasure stirs up
strife, And a master of rage has many a transgression.
Prov
29:23  The pride of man brings him low,
But the humble in spirit obtains esteem.
Prov
29:24  He who shares with a thief hates
his own life; He hears an oath, but does not report.
Prov
29:25  The fear of man brings a snare,
But whoever trusts in יהוה is set on high.
Prov
29:26  Many seek the face of a ruler, But
right-ruling for man comes from יהוה.
Prov
29:27  An unrighteous man Is an
abomination to the righteous, And he who is straight in the way Is an
abomination to the wrong.
Prov
30:1  The words of Aḡur son of
Yaqeh, a message. This man declared to Ithi’ĕl, to Ithi’ĕl and Uḵal:
Prov
30:2  For I am more stupid than anyone,
And do not have the understanding of a man.
Prov
30:3  And I have not learned wisdom That
I should know the knowledge of the Set-apart One.
Prov
30:4  Who has gone up to the heavens and
come down? Who has gathered the wind in His fists? Who has bound the waters in
a garment? Who established all the ends of the earth? What is His Name, And
what is His Son’s Name, If you know it?
Prov
30:5  Every Word of Eloah is tried; He is
a shield to those taking refuge in Him.
Prov
30:6  Do not add to His Words, Lest He
reprove you,
Prov
30:7  Two matters I have asked of You – Deny them not to me before I die:
Prov
30:8  Remove falsehood and a lying word
far from me; Give me neither poverty nor riches; Feed me my portion of bread;
Prov
30:9  Lest I become satisfied and deny You, And say, “Who is יהוה
?” And lest I be poor, and steal, And seize the Name of my Elohim.
Prov
30:10  Do not slander a servant to his
master, Lest he curse you, And you be found guilty.
Prov
30:11  There is a generation that curses
its father, And does not bless its mother –
Prov
30:12  There is a generation, clean in
its own eyes, But not washed from its own filth.
Prov
30:13  There is a generation; Oh, how
haughty are their eyes! And their eyelids are lifted up.
Prov
30:14  There is a generation whose teeth
are swords, And whose jaw-teeth are knives, To devour the poor from off the
earth, And the needy from among men.
Prov
30:15  The leech has two daughters: “Give!
Give!” Three are not satisfied, Four that never say, “Enough”:
Prov
30:16  The grave, and the barren womb,
Soil not satisfied with water, And fire which never says, “Enough.”
Prov
30:17  An eye that mocks his father, And
scorns to obey his mother – Ravens of the wadi dig it out, And young eagles eat
it!
Prov
30:18  Three matters are too marvellous for me, And four which I do not understand:
Prov
30:19  The way of an eagle in the
heavens, The way of a snake on a rock, The way of a ship in the heart of the
sea, And the way of a man with a girl.
Prov
30:20  This is the way of an adulterous
woman: She shall eat and wipe her mouth, and say, “I have not done wickedness.”
Prov
30:21  Under three matters the earth trembles, And under four, it is unable to bear:
Prov
30:22  Under a servant when he reigns,
And a fool when he is satisfied with food,
Prov
30:23  Under a hated woman who marries, And a female servant who supplants her mistress.
Prov
30:24  There are four matters Which are little on the earth,
But they are exceedingly wise:
Prov
30:25  The ants are a people not strong,
Yet they prepare their food in the summer;
Prov
30:26  The rock badgers are a weak folk,
Yet they make their homes in the crags;
Prov
30:27  The locusts have no sovereign, Yet
they all go out in formation;
Prov
30:28  A spider takes hold with two
hands, And is in sovereigns’ palaces.
Prov
30:29  There are three matters That are going well, And four
are good in walking:
Prov
30:30  A lion, which is mighty among
beasts And does not turn away from facing all;
Prov
30:31  A greyhound, and a male goat, And
a sovereign whose army is with him.
Prov
30:32  If you have been foolish in
lifting up yourself, Or if you have plotted evil, Put your hand on your mouth.
Prov
30:33  For as milk under pressure brings
forth curds, And as a nose under pressure brings forth blood, So wrath under
pressure brings forth strife.
Prov
31:1  The words of Sovereign Lemu’ĕl,
a message which his mother taught him:
Prov
31:2  What, my son? And what, son of my
womb? And what, son of my vows?
Prov
31:3  Do not give your strength to women,
Nor your ways to wiping away sovereigns.
Prov
31:4  Not for sovereigns, O Lemu’ĕl,
Not for sovereigns to drink wine, Nor for princes to desire strong drink;
Prov
31:5  Lest they drink and forget the law,
And pervert the right of all the afflicted.
Prov
31:6  Give strong drink to him who is
perishing, And wine to those embittered in being.
Prov
31:7  Let him drink and forget his
poverty, And remember his trouble no more.
Prov
31:8  Open your mouth for the dumb, In
the cause of all the sons of the departed.
Prov
31:9  Open your mouth, judge righteously,
And plead the cause of the poor and needy.
Prov
31:10  Who does find a capable wife? For
she is worth far more than rubies.
Prov
31:11  The heart of her husband shall
trust her, And he has no lack of gain.
Prov
31:12  She shall do him good, and not
evil, All the days of her life.
Prov
31:13  She shall seek wool and flax, And
with delight she works with her hands.
Prov
31:14  She shall be as the ships of
Tarshish, She brings in her food from afar.
Prov
31:15  She also rises while it is still
night, And provides food for her household, And a portion for her girls.
Prov
31:16  She shall consider a field and buy
it; From her profits she shall plant a vineyard.
Prov
31:17  She shall gird herself with
strength, And strengthen her arms.
Prov
31:18  She shall taste when her gain is
good; Her lamp does not go out by night.
Prov
31:19  She shall stretch out her hands to
the distaff, And her hand shall hold the spindle.
Prov
31:20  She shall extend her hand to the
poor, And she shall reach out her hands to the needy.
Prov
31:21  She is not afraid of snow for her
household, For all her household is dressed in scarlet.
Prov
31:22  She shall make tapestry for
herself; She is dressed in fine linen and purple.
Prov
31:23  Her husband is known in the gates,
When he sits among the elders of the land.
Prov
31:24  She shall make fine linen and sell
them, And shall give girdles for the merchants.
Prov
31:25  Strength and splendour are her
garments, And she rejoices in time to come.
Prov
31:26  She shall open her mouth with
wisdom, And on her tongue is the Torah of kindness.
Prov
31:27  She watches over the ways of her
household, And does not eat the bread of idleness.
Prov
31:28  Her children shall rise up and
call her blessed; Her husband too,
and he praises her:
Prov
31:29  “Many daughters have done nobly,
But you have risen over them all.”
Prov
31:30  Loveliness is deceptive And
prettiness is vain, A woman who fears יהוה is to be
praised.
Prov
31:31  Give her of the fruit of her
hands, And let her works praise her in the gates.
