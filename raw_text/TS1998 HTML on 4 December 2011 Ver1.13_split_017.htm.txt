Melaḵim Aleph/1 Kings
1Kings
1:1  And Sovereign Dawiḏ was old,
advanced in years. And they covered him with garments, but he could not get
warm. 
1Kings
1:2  So his servants said to him, “Let
them seek for our master the sovereign a young woman, a maiden, and she shall
stand before the sovereign and be his companion, and shall lie in your bosom,
so that our master the sovereign gets warm.” 
1Kings
1:3  And they sought for a lovely young
woman in all the border of Yisra’ĕl, and found Aḇishaḡ the
Shunammite, and brought her to the sovereign. 
1Kings
1:4  And the young woman was very lovely.
And she was a companion for the sovereign, and served him, but the sovereign
did not know her. 
1Kings
1:5  And Aḏoniyah son of Ḥaggith
exalted himself, saying, “I reign.” And he prepared for himself a chariot and
horsemen, and fifty men to run before him. 
1Kings
1:6  Now his father had not worried him
at any time by saying, “Why have you done so?” He was also very good-looking.
And he was born after Aḇshalom. 
1Kings
1:7  And he talked with Yo’aḇ son
of Tseruyah and with Eḇyathar the priest, and they supported Aḏoniyah.

1Kings
1:8  But Tsaḏoq the priest, and
Benayahu son of Yehoyaḏa, and Nathan the prophet, and Shim‛i, and Rĕ‛i,
and the mighty men who belonged to Dawiḏ were not with Aḏoniyahu. 
1Kings
1:9  And Aḏoniyahu offered sheep
and cattle and fatlings by the stone of Zoḥeleth, which is by Ĕn Roḡĕl.
He also invited all his brothers, the sovereign’s sons, and all the men of Yehuḏah,
servants of the sovereign. 
1Kings
1:10  But he did not invite Nathan the
prophet, or Benayahu, or the mighty men, or Shelomoh his brother. 
1Kings
1:11  Nathan then spoke to Bathsheḇa
the mother of Shelomoh, saying, “Have you not heard that Aḏoniyahu son of
Ḥaggith has become sovereign, and Dawiḏ our master does not know
it? 
1Kings
1:12  “And now, come let me give you
advice, and deliver your own life and the life of your son Shelomoh. 
1Kings
1:13  “Go immediately to Sovereign Dawiḏ
and say to him, ‘Did you not, my master, O sovereign, swear to your female
servant, saying, “Certainly, your son Shelomoh shall reign after me, and he
shall sit on my throne”? Why then has Aḏoniyahu become sovereign?’  
1Kings
1:14  “Look, while you are still speaking
there with the sovereign let me come in after you and confirm your words.” 
1Kings
1:15  And Bathsheḇa went into the
room to the sovereign. Now the sovereign was very old, and Aḇishaḡ
the Shunammite was serving the sovereign. 
1Kings
1:16  And Bathsheḇa bowed and did
obeisance to the sovereign. And the sovereign said, “What do you wish?” 
1Kings
1:17  And she said to him, “My master,
you swore by יהוה your Elohim to your female servant,
saying, ‘Certainly, Shelomoh your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on
my throne.’ 
1Kings
1:18  “And now, look! Aḏoniyah has
become sovereign. And now, my master the sovereign, you do not know about it. 
1Kings
1:19  “And he has offered great numbers
of bulls and fatlings and sheep, and has invited all the sons of the sovereign,
and Eḇyathar the priest, and Yo’aḇ the commander of the army, but
he did not invite Shelomoh your servant. 
1Kings
1:20  “And you my master, O sovereign,
the eyes of all Yisra’ĕl are on you, to declare to them who is going to
sit on the throne of my master the sovereign after him. 
1Kings
1:21  “Otherwise it shall be, when my
master the sovereign rests with his fathers, that I and my son Shelomoh shall
be considered sinners.” 
1Kings
1:22  And see, while she was still
speaking with the sovereign, Nathan the prophet also came in. 
1Kings
1:23  So they informed the sovereign,
saying, “Here is Nathan the prophet.” And when he came in before the sovereign,
he bowed down before the sovereign with his face to the ground. 
1Kings
1:24  And Nathan said, “My master, O
sovereign, have you said, ‘Aḏoniyahu shall reign after me, and he shall
sit on my throne’? 
1Kings
1:25  “For he has gone down today, and
has offered great numbers of bulls and fatlings and sheep, and has invited all
the sovereign’s sons, and the commanders of the army, and Eḇyathar the
priest. And look! They are eating and drinking before him. And they say, ‘Let
Sovereign Aḏoniyahu live!’ 
1Kings
1:26  “But he has not invited me, me your
servant, nor Tsaḏoq the priest, nor Benayahu son of Yehoyaḏa, nor
your servant Shelomoh. 
1Kings
1:27  “If this matter is from my master
the sovereign, then you did not let your servant know who should sit on the
throne of my master the sovereign after him.” 
1Kings
1:28  And Sovereign Dawiḏ answered
and said, “Call Bathsheḇa to me.” So she came into the sovereign’s
presence and stood before the sovereign. 
1Kings
1:29  And the sovereign took an oath and
said, “As יהוה lives, who has redeemed my life out of
all distress, 
1Kings
1:30  even as I swore to you by יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, saying, ‘Certainly, Shelomoh your son shall reign
after me, and he shall sit on my throne in my place,’ even so I do this day.” 
1Kings
1:31  And Bathsheḇa bowed with her
face to the earth, and did obeisance to the sovereign, and said, “Let my master
Sovereign Dawiḏ live forever!” 
1Kings
1:32  And Sovereign Dawiḏ said, “Call
me Tsaḏoq the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benayahu son of Yehoyaḏa.”
And they came before the sovereign. 
1Kings
1:33  And the sovereign said to them, “Take
with you the servants of your master, and you shall have Shelomoh my son ride
on my own mule, and take him down to Giḥon. 
1Kings
1:34  “And there Tsaḏoq the priest
and Nathan the prophet shall anoint him sovereign over Yisra’ĕl. And blow
the horn, and say, ‘Let Sovereign Shelomoh live!’ 
1Kings
1:35  “And you shall come up after him,
and he shall come and sit on my throne, and he shall reign in my place. For I
have appointed him to be ruler over Yisra’ĕl and over Yehuḏah.”
1Kings
1:36  And Benayahu son of Yehoyaḏa
answered the sovereign and said, “Amĕn! So says יהוה
Elohim of my master the sovereign. 
1Kings
1:37  “As יהוה
has been with my master the sovereign, so let Him be with Shelomoh and make his
throne greater than the throne of my master Sovereign Dawiḏ.” 
1Kings
1:38  Then Tsaḏoq the priest, and
Nathan the prophet, and Benayahu son of Yehoyaḏa, and the Kerĕthites,
and the Pelĕthites went down and had Shelomoh ride on Sovereign Dawiḏ’s
mule, and took him to Giḥon. 
1Kings
1:39  And Tsaḏoq the priest took a
horn of oil from the Tent and anointed Shelomoh. And they blew the horn, and
all the people said, “Let Sovereign Shelomoh live!” 
1Kings
1:40  And all the people came up after
him. And the people played the flutes and rejoiced with great joy, so that the
earth was split by their noise! 
1Kings
1:41  And Aḏoniyahu and all the
guests who were with him heard it as they had finished eating. And Yo’aḇ
heard the sound of the horn, and said, “Why is the city in such a noisy uproar?”

1Kings
1:42  And he was still speaking, then
see, Yonathan came, son of Eḇyathar the priest. And Aḏoniyahu said
to him, “Come in, for you are a brave man, and you bring good news.” 
1Kings
1:43  But Yonathan answered and said to Aḏoniyahu,
“No! Our master Sovereign Dawiḏ has made Shelomoh sovereign, 
1Kings
1:44  and the sovereign has sent with him
Tsaḏoq the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benayahu son of Yehoyaḏa,
and the Kerĕthites, and the Pelĕthites. And they had him ride on the
sovereign’s mule. 
1Kings
1:45  “And Tsaḏoq the priest and
Nathan the prophet have anointed him sovereign at Giḥon. And they have
gone up from there rejoicing, and the city is moved. This is the noise you
heard. 
1Kings
1:46  “And further, Shelomoh sits on the
throne of the reign. 
1Kings
1:47  “And further, the servants of the
sovereign have gone to bless our master Sovereign Dawiḏ, saying, ‘Let
your Elohim make the name of Shelomoh better than your name, and his throne
greater than your throne.’ And the sovereign bowed himself on the bed. 
1Kings
1:48  “And the sovereign also said thus, ‘Blessed
be יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, who has given one to
sit on my throne this day, while my eyes see it!’ ” 
1Kings
1:49  And all the guests who were invited
by Aḏoniyahu were afraid, and rose, and each one went his way. 
1Kings
1:50  And Aḏoniyahu was afraid of
Shelomoh, and rose, and went and took hold of the horns of the altar. 
1Kings
1:51  And it was reported to Shelomoh,
saying, “Look, Aḏoniyahu is afraid of Sovereign Shelomoh. And look, he
has taken hold of the horns of the altar, saying, ‘Let Sovereign Shelomoh swear
to me today that he does not put his servant to death with the sword.’ ” 
1Kings
1:52  And Shelomoh said, “If he proves
himself a worthy man, not one hair of him is going to fall to the earth, but if
evil is found in him, then he shall die.” 
1Kings
1:53  And Sovereign Shelomoh sent, and
they brought him down from the altar. And he came and fell down before
Sovereign Shelomoh. And Shelomoh said to him, “Go to your house.”
1Kings
2:1  And the days of Dawiḏ drew
near to die, and he commanded Shelomoh his son, saying,
1Kings
2:2  “I am going the way of all the
earth. And you shall be strong, and be a man. 
1Kings
2:3  “And guard the Charge of יהוה
your Elohim: to walk in His ways, to guard His laws, His commands, His
right-rulings, and His witnesses, as it is written in the Torah of Mosheh, so
that you do wisely all that you do and wherever you turn; 
1Kings
2:4  so that יהוה
does establish His word which He spoke concerning me, saying, ‘If your sons
guard their way, to walk before Me in truth with all their heart and with all
their being,’ saying, ‘there is not to cease a man of yours on the throne of
Yisra’ĕl.’ 
1Kings
2:5  “And also, you know what Yo’aḇ
son of Tseruyah did to me, and what he did to the two commanders of the armies
of Yisra’ĕl, to Aḇnĕr son of Nĕr and Amasa son of Yether,
that he slew them, and shed the blood of battle in peace, and put the blood of
battle on his belt that was around his waist, and on his sandals that were on
his feet.
1Kings
2:6  “So act according to your wisdom,
and do not let his grey hair go down to the grave in peace. 
1Kings
2:7  “But show kindness to the sons of
Barzillai the Gil‛aḏite, and let them be among those who eat at
your table, for so they came to me when I fled from Aḇshalom your
brother. 
1Kings
2:8  “And see, with you is Shim‛i
son of Gĕra, the Binyamite from Baḥurim, who cursed me with a
grievous cursing in the day when I went to Maḥanayim. But he came down to
meet me at the Yardĕn, and I swore to him by יהוה,
saying, ‘I shall not put you to death with the sword.’ 
1Kings
2:9  “And now, do not leave him
unpunished, for you are a wise man and know what you should do to him, and
shall bring his grey hair down to the grave with blood.” 
1Kings
2:10  And Dawiḏ slept with his
fathers, and was buried in the City of Dawiḏ. 
1Kings
2:11  And the days that Dawiḏ
reigned over Yisra’ĕl was forty years. He reigned seven years in Ḥeḇron,
and in Yerushalayim he reigned thirty-three years. 
1Kings
2:12  And Shelomoh sat on the throne of
his father Dawiḏ. And his reign was firmly established. 
1Kings
2:13  And Aḏoniyahu son of Ḥaggith
came to Bathsheḇa the mother of Shelomoh, and she said, “Do you come in
peace?” And he said, “Peace.” 
1Kings
2:14  And he said, “I have a word for
you,” and she said, “Speak.” 
1Kings
2:15  And he said, “You know that the
reign was mine, and all Yisra’ĕl had set their faces toward me, that I
should reign. But the reign has been turned around, and has become my brother’s,
for it was his from יהוה. 
1Kings
2:16  “And now, I am making one request
of you, do not refuse me.” And she said to him, “Say it.” 
1Kings
2:17  And he said, “Please speak to
Sovereign Shelomoh – for he would not refuse you – to give me Aḇishaḡ
the Shunammite as wife.” 
1Kings
2:18  And Bathsheḇa said, “Good,
let me speak for you to the sovereign.” 
1Kings
2:19  And Bathsheḇa came to
Sovereign Shelomoh, to speak to him for Aḏoniyahu. And the sovereign rose
up to meet her and bowed down to her, and sat down on his throne and had a
throne set for the sovereign’s mother. So she sat at his right hand. 
1Kings
2:20  And she said, “I am making one
small request of you, do not refuse me.” And the sovereign said to her, “Ask
it, my mother, for I do not refuse you.” 
1Kings
2:21  Then she said, “Let Aḇishaḡ
the Shunammite be given to Aḏoniyahu your brother as wife.” 
1Kings
2:22  And Sovereign Shelomoh answered and
said to his mother, “Now why do you ask Aḇishaḡ the Shunammite for
Aḏoniyahu? Ask for him the reign also – for he is my older brother – for
him, and for Eḇyathar the priest, and for Yo’aḇ son of Tseruyah.” 
1Kings
2:23  And Sovereign Shelomoh swore by יהוה,
saying, “Elohim does so to me, and more also, if Aḏoniyahu has not spoken
this word against his own life! 
1Kings
2:24  “And now, as יהוה
lives, who established me and set me on the throne of Dawiḏ my father,
and who has made me a house, as He promised, Aḏoniyahu shall be put to
death today!” 
1Kings
2:25  And Sovereign Shelomoh sent by the
hand of Benayahu son of Yehoyaḏa, and he fell upon him, and he died. 
1Kings
2:26  Then the sovereign said to Eḇyathar
the priest, “Go to Anathoth, to your own fields, for you deserve death. But I
do not put you to death at this time, because you did bear the ark of the
Master יהוה before my father Dawiḏ, and because
you were afflicted in all my father was afflicted in.” 
1Kings
2:27  So Shelomoh dismissed Eḇyathar
from being priest to יהוה, to fill the word of יהוה
which He spoke concerning the house of Ĕli at Shiloh. 
1Kings
2:28  And news came to Yo’aḇ, for
Yo’aḇ had turned aside after Aḏoniyah, though he did not turn aside
after Aḇshalom. And Yo’aḇ fled to the Tent of יהוה,
and took hold of the horns of the altar. 
1Kings
2:29  And the report came to Sovereign
Shelomoh that Yo’aḇ had fled to the Tent of יהוה,
and see, he is by the altar. Then Shelomoh sent Benayahu son of Yehoyaḏa,
saying, “Go, fall on him.” 
1Kings
2:30  So Benayahu came to the Tent of יהוה
and said to him, “Thus said the sovereign, ‘Come out!’ ” And he said, “No, for
here I die.” And Benayahu brought back word to the sovereign, saying, “Thus
said Yo’aḇ, and thus he answered me.” 
1Kings
2:31  And the sovereign said to him, “Do
as he has said, and fall upon him. And you shall bury him, so that you take
away from me and from the house of my father the blood which Yo’aḇ shed
without cause. 
1Kings
2:32  “Thus יהוה
shall return his blood on his head, because he had fallen on two men more
righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, while my father
Dawiḏ did not know it: Aḇnĕr son of Nĕr, commander of the
army of Yisra’ĕl, and Amasa son of Yether, commander of the army of Yehuḏah.

1Kings
2:33  “So shall their blood return upon
the head of Yo’aḇ and upon the head of his seed forever. But upon Dawiḏ
and his seed, upon his house and his throne, there is to be peace forever from יהוה.”

1Kings
2:34  Then Benayahu son of Yehoyaḏa
went up and fell upon him and put him to death. And he was buried in his own
house in the wilderness. 
1Kings
2:35  And the sovereign put Benayahu son
of Yehoyaḏa in his place over the army, and the sovereign put Tsaḏoq
the priest in the place of Eḇyathar. 
1Kings
2:36  And the sovereign sent and called
for Shim‛i, and said to him, “Build yourself a house in Yerushalayim and
dwell there, and do not go out from there anywhere. 
1Kings
2:37  “And it shall be, on the day you go
out and pass over the wadi Qiḏron, know for certain that you shall die –
your blood is on your own head.” 
1Kings
2:38  And Shim‛i said to the
sovereign, “The word is good. As my master the sovereign has said, so your
servant does.” So Shim‛i dwelt in Yerushalayim many days. 
1Kings
2:39  And it came to be at the end of
three years, that two slaves of Shim‛i fled to Aḵish son of Ma‛aḵah,
sovereign of Gath. And they informed Shim‛i, saying, “See, your slaves
are in Gath!” 
1Kings
2:40  And Shim‛i rose up, and
saddled his donkey, and went to Aḵish at Gath to look for his slaves. And
Shim‛i went and brought his slaves from Gath. 
1Kings
2:41  And Shelomoh was told that Shim‛i
had gone from Yerushalayim to Gath and had come back. 
1Kings
2:42  So the sovereign sent and called
for Shim‛i, and said to him, “Did I not make you swear by יהוה,
and warn you, saying, ‘Know for certain that on the day you leave to go
anywhere, you shall certainly die’? And you said to me, ‘The word I have heard
is good.’ 
1Kings
2:43  “And why have you not guarded the
oath of יהוה and the command that I gave you?” 
1Kings
2:44  The sovereign also said to Shim‛i,
“You shall know all the evil that your heart has known, that you did to my
father Dawiḏ. And יהוה shall return your evil on
your own head. 
1Kings
2:45  “But Sovereign Shelomoh is blessed,
and the throne of Dawiḏ is established before יהוה
forever.” 
1Kings
2:46  So the sovereign ordered Benayahu
son of Yehoyaḏa, and he went out and fell on him, and he died. And the
reign was established in the hand of Shelomoh. 
1Kings
3:1  And Shelomoh joined in marriage with
Pharaoh sovereign of Mitsrayim, and took the daughter of Pharaoh, and brought
her to the City of Dawiḏ until he had completed building his own house,
and the House of יהוה, and the wall all around Yerushalayim.

1Kings
3:2  Only, the people slaughtered at the
high places, for a house for the Name of יהוה had not
been built until those days. 
1Kings
3:3  And Shelomoh loved יהוה,
walking in the laws of his father Dawiḏ, except that he slaughtered and
burned incense at the high places.
1Kings
3:4  And the sovereign went to Gib‛on
to slaughter there, for that was the great high place. Shelomoh offered a
thousand burnt offerings on that altar. 
1Kings
3:5  At Gib‛on יהוה
appeared to Shelomoh in a dream by night, and Elohim said, “Ask what I should
give you.” 
1Kings
3:6  And Shelomoh said, “You have shown
great kindness to your servant Dawiḏ my father, as he walked before You
in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with You. And You
have guarded for him this great kindness, and did give him a son to sit on his
throne, as it is this day. 
1Kings
3:7  “And now, O יהוה
my Elohim, You have set up Your servant to reign instead of my father Dawiḏ.
But I am a little child, I do not know how to go out or to come in. 
1Kings
3:8  “And Your servant is in the midst of
Your people whom You have chosen, a great people, too numerous to be numbered
or counted. 
1Kings
3:9  “Shall You then give to Your servant
an understanding heart to rule Your people, to discern between good and evil?
For who is able to rule this great people of Yours?” 
1Kings
3:10  And the word was good in the eyes
of יהוה, that Shelomoh had asked this. 
1Kings
3:11  So Elohim said to him, “Because you
have asked this, and have not asked long life for yourself, nor have asked
riches for yourself, nor have asked the life of your enemies, but have asked
for yourself discernment to understand right-ruling, 
1Kings
3:12  see, I shall do according to your
words. See, I shall give you a wise and understanding heart, so that there was
none like you before you, and none like you shall arise after you. 
1Kings
3:13  “And I shall also give you what you
have not asked: both riches and esteem, so that there shall not be anyone like
you among the sovereigns all your days. 
1Kings
3:14  “And if you walk in My ways, to
guard My laws and My commands, as your father Dawiḏ walked, then I shall
prolong your days.” 
1Kings
3:15  And Shelomoh awoke, and see, it was
a dream! And he came into Yerushalayim and stood before the ark of the covenant
of יהוה, and offered up burnt offerings and made peace
offerings. And he made a feast for all his servants. 
1Kings
3:16  Then two women, whores, came to the
sovereign, and stood before him. 
1Kings
3:17  And one woman said, “O my master,
this woman and I dwell in the same house. And I gave birth while she was in the
house. 
1Kings
3:18  “And it came to be, the third day
after I had given birth, that this woman also gave birth. And we were together.
There was no one else with us in the house, only the two of us in the house. 
1Kings
3:19  “Then this woman’s son died in the
night, because she lay on him. 
1Kings
3:20  “And she rose up in the middle of
the night and took my son from my side, while your female servant slept, and
laid him in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom. 
1Kings
3:21  “And I rose up in the morning to
nurse my son and saw he was dead. But I looked at him closely in the morning,
and saw he was not my son whom I had borne.” 
1Kings
3:22  And the other woman said, “No! But
the living one is my son, and the dead one is your son.” And the first woman
said, “No! For the dead one is your son, and the living one is my son.” And
they spoke before the sovereign. 
1Kings
3:23  And the sovereign said, “The one
says, ‘This is my son, who lives, and your son is the dead one,’ while the
other says, ‘No! For your son is the dead one, and my son is the living one.’ ”

1Kings
3:24  And the sovereign said, “Bring me a
sword.” So they brought a sword before the sovereign. 
1Kings
3:25  And the sovereign said, “Divide the
living child in two, and give half to one, and half to the other.” 
1Kings
3:26  And the woman whose son was living
spoke to the sovereign, for she was overcome with compassion for her son. And
she said, “O my master, give her the living child, and by no means kill him!”
But the other said, “Let him be neither mine nor yours, but divide him.” 
1Kings
3:27  And the sovereign answered and
said, “Give the first woman the living child, and by no means kill him – she is
his mother.” 
1Kings
3:28  And all Yisra’ĕl heard of the
right- ruling which the sovereign had rendered. And they feared the sovereign,
for they saw that the wisdom of Elohim was in him to do right-ruling.
1Kings
4:1  And it came to be that Sovereign
Shelomoh was sovereign over all Yisra’ĕl. 
1Kings
4:2  And these were his chief officials:
Azaryahu son of Tsaḏoq, the priest; 
1Kings
4:3  Eliḥoreph and Aḥiyah,
sons of Shisha, scribes; Yehoshaphat son of Aḥiluḏ, the recorder; 
1Kings
4:4  and Benayahu son of Yehoyaḏa,
over the army; and Tsaḏoq and Eḇyathar, the priests; 
1Kings
4:5  and Azaryahu son of Nathan, over the
officers; Zaḇuḏ son of Nathan, a priest, friend of the sovereign; 
1Kings
4:6  and Aḥishar, over the household;
and Aḏoniram son of Aḇda, over the compulsory labour. 
1Kings
4:7  And Shelomoh had twelve governors
over all Yisra’ĕl, who provided food for the sovereign and his household –
each one made provision for one month of the year – 
1Kings
4:8  and these were their names: Ben-Ḥur,
in the mountains of Ephrayim; 
1Kings
4:9  Ben-Deqer, in Maqats and Sha‛alḇim
and Bĕyth Shemesh and Ĕlon Bĕyth Ḥanan; 
1Kings
4:10  Ben-Ḥeseḏ in Arubboth,
Soḵoh and all the land of Ḥĕpher were his; 
1Kings
4:11  Ben-Aḇinaḏaḇ, all
the height of Dor, Taphath the daughter of Shelomoh became his wife; 
1Kings
4:12  Ba‛ana son of Aḥiluḏ,
in Ta‛anaḵ and Meḡiddo, and all Bĕyth She’an, which is
beside Tsarethan below Yizre‛ĕl, from Bĕyth She’an to Aḇĕl
Meḥolah, as far as the other side of Yoqne‛am; 
1Kings
4:13  Ben-Geḇer, in Ramoth Gil‛aḏ,
the towns of Ya’ir son of Menashsheh in Gil‛aḏ were his; the
portion of Argoḇ in Bashan, sixty large cities with walls and bronze
gate-bars, were his; 
1Kings
4:14  Aḥinaḏaḇ son of
Iddo, in Maḥanayim; 
1Kings
4:15  Aḥima‛ats in Naphtali;
he also took Basemath the daughter of Shelomoh as wife; 
1Kings
4:16  Ba‛anah son of Ḥushai,
in Ashĕr and in Aloth; 
1Kings
4:17  Yehoshaphat son of Paruwaḥ,
in Yissasḵar; 
1Kings
4:18  Shim‛i son of Ĕlah, in
Binyamin; 
1Kings
4:19  Geḇer son of Uri, in the land
of Gil‛aḏ, in the land of Siḥon sovereign of the Amorites and
of Oḡ sovereign of Bashan, and one governor was in the land. 
1Kings
4:20  Yehuḏah and Yisra’ĕl
were as numerous as the sand by the sea, eating and drinking and rejoicing. 
1Kings
4:21  And Shelomoh was ruling over all
reigns from the River to the land of the Philistines, as far as the border of
Mitsrayim. They did taskwork and served Shelomoh all the days of his life. 
1Kings
4:22  And Shelomoh’s food supply for one
day was thirty kors of fine flour, and sixty kors of meal, 
1Kings
4:23  ten fatted cattle and twenty cattle
from the pastures, and one hundred sheep, besides deer, and gazelles, and
roebucks, and fatted fowl. 
1Kings
4:24  For he was ruling over all on this
side of the River from Tiphsaḥ even to Azzah, over all the sovereigns on
this side of the River. And he had peace on all sides round about him. 
1Kings
4:25  And Yehuḏah and Yisra’ĕl
dwelt safely, each man under his vine and his fig tree, from Dan as far as Be’ĕrsheḇa,
all the days of Shelomoh. 
1Kings
4:26  And Shelomoh had forty thousand
stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen. 
1Kings
4:27  And these governors, each one in
his month, provided food for Sovereign Shelomoh and for all who came to the
table of Sovereign Shelomoh. There was no lack in their supply. 
1Kings
4:28  They also brought barley and straw
to the appointed place, for the horses and steeds, each one according to his
right- ruling.
1Kings
4:29  And Elohim gave Shelomoh exceeding
great wisdom and understanding, and largeness of heart like the sand on the
seashore. 
1Kings
4:30  And Shelomoh’s wisdom excelled the
wisdom of all the men of the East and all the wisdom of Mitsrayim. 
1Kings
4:31  For he was wiser than all men, than
Ĕythan the Ezrahite, and Hĕman, and Kalkol, and Darda, the sons of
Maḥol. And his name was in all the nations round about. 
1Kings
4:32  And he spoke three thousand
proverbs, and his songs were one thousand and five. 
1Kings
4:33  And he spoke of trees, from the
cedar tree of Leḇanon even to the hyssop that springs out of the wall.
And he spoke of beasts, and of birds, and of creeping creatures, and of fish.
1Kings
4:34  And there came from all peoples,
from all the sovereigns of the earth who had heard of his wisdom, to hear the
wisdom of Shelomoh. 
1Kings
5:1  And Ḥiram sovereign of Tsor
sent his servants to Shelomoh, because he heard that they had anointed him
sovereign in place of his father, for Ḥiram had always loved Dawiḏ.

1Kings
5:2  And Shelomoh sent to Ḥiram,
saying, 
1Kings
5:3  “You know my father Dawiḏ was
unable to build a house for the Name of יהוה his Elohim
because of the battles which were all around him, until יהוה
put them under the soles of his feet. 
1Kings
5:4  “But now יהוה
my Elohim has given me rest all around, there is neither adversary nor evil
incident. 
1Kings
5:5  “And see, I intend to build a house
for the Name of יהוה my Elohim, as יהוה
spoke to my father Dawiḏ, saying, ‘Your son, whom I set on your throne in
your place, he does build the house for My Name.’ 
1Kings
5:6  “And now, command that they cut down
cedars for me from Leḇanon. And let my servants be with your servants,
and let me pay you wages for your servants according to whatever you say. For
you know there is none among us who knows to cut timber like the Tsiḏonians.”

1Kings
5:7  And it came to be, when Ḥiram
heard the words of Shelomoh, that he rejoiced greatly and said, “Blessed be יהוה
this day, for He has given Dawiḏ a wise son over this great people!” 
1Kings
5:8  And Ḥiram sent to Shelomoh,
saying, “I have heard that which you sent me. Let me do all you desire
concerning the cedar and cypress logs. 
1Kings
5:9  “Let my servants bring them down
from Leḇanon to the sea, then I put them in rafts by sea to the place you
direct me. And I shall spread them out there, then you take them up, while you
do my desire by giving food for my household.” 
1Kings
5:10  And Ḥiram gave Shelomoh cedar
and cypress logs – all his desire. 
1Kings
5:11  And Shelomoh gave Ḥiram
twenty thousand kors of wheat as food for his household, and twenty kors of
pressed oil. Thus Shelomoh gave to Ḥiram year by year. 
1Kings
5:12  And יהוה
gave Shelomoh wisdom, as He promised him. And there was peace between Ḥiram
and Shelomoh, and the two of them made a covenant. 
1Kings
5:13  And Sovereign Shelomoh raised up
compulsory labour out of all Yisra’ĕl. And the compulsory labour was
thirty thousand men. 
1Kings
5:14  And he sent them to Leḇanon,
ten thousand a month by courses – they were one month in Leḇanon, two
months at home. And Aḏoniram was over the compulsory labour. 
1Kings
5:15  And Shelomoh had seventy thousand
bearing burdens, and eighty thousand hewing stone
in the mountains, 
1Kings
5:16  besides three thousand three
hundred from the chiefs of Shelomoh’s deputies who were over the work, those
ruling over the people who laboured in the work. 
1Kings
5:17  And the sovereign commanded, and
they brought large stones, precious stones, to lay the foundation of the House
with hewn stones. 
1Kings
5:18  And Shelomoh’s builders, and Ḥiram’s
builders, and the men of Geḇal did hew, and prepared timber and stones to
build the House. 
1Kings
6:1  And it came to be, in the four
hundred and eightieth year after the children of Yisra’ĕl had come out of
the land of Mitsrayim, in the fourth year of the reign of Shelomoh over Yisra’ĕl,
in the month of Ziw, which is the second month, that he began to build the
House of יהוה. 
1Kings
6:2  And the house which Sovereign Shelomoh
built for יהוה was sixty cubits long, and twenty wide,
and thirty cubits high. 
1Kings
6:3  And the porch at the front of the hĕḵal
of the House was twenty cubits long, according to the breadth of the House, and
its width ten cubits, from the front of the House. 
1Kings
6:4  And he made for the House windows
with narrowed frames. 
1Kings
6:5  And against the wall of the House he
built rooms all around, against the
walls of the House, all around the hĕḵal and the Speaking Place.
Thus he made side rooms all around. 
1Kings
6:6  The lowest side room was five cubits
wide, and the middle one was six cubits wide, and the third one was seven
cubits wide; for he made narrow ledges around the outside of the House, so as
not to lay hold on the walls of the House. 
1Kings
6:7  And the House, when it was being
built, was built with finished stone made ready beforehand, so that no hammer
or chisel or any iron tool was heard in the House while it was being built. 
1Kings
6:8  The doorway for the middle side room
was on the right side of the House. And they went up by stairs to the middle
side rooms, and from the middle to the third. 
1Kings
6:9  So he built the House and completed
it, and he panelled the House with beams and boards of cedar. 
1Kings
6:10  And he built the side rooms of the
structure against all the House, each five cubits high, and they were fastened
to the House with cedar beams. 
1Kings
6:11  And the word of יהוה
came to Shelomoh, saying, 
1Kings
6:12  “This House which you are building –
if you walk in My laws, and do My right-rulings, and shall guard all My
commands and walk in them, then I shall confirm My word with you, which I spoke
to your father Dawiḏ, 
1Kings
6:13  and shall dwell in the midst of the
children of Yisra’ĕl, and not forsake My people Yisra’ĕl.” 
1Kings
6:14  So Shelomoh built the House and
completed it. 
1Kings
6:15  And he built the walls of the House
inside with cedar boards, from the floor of the House to the ceiling he
panelled them on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the House with
planks of cypress. 
1Kings
6:16  And he built twenty cubits at the
rear of the House, from floor to the walls, with cedar boards. And he built it
inside as the Speaking Place, as the Most Set-apart Place. 
1Kings
6:17  And the House was forty cubits, it
is the hĕḵal before it. 
1Kings
6:18  And the cedar for the House inside
was carved with ornaments and open flowers; all was cedar, not a stone was
seen. 
1Kings
6:19  And he prepared the Speaking Place
in the midst of the House, to place the ark of the covenant of יהוה
there. 
1Kings
6:20  And the front of the Speaking Place
was twenty cubits long, and twenty cubits wide, and twenty cubits high. And he
overlaid it with refined gold, and overlaid the altar of cedar. 
1Kings
6:21  And Shelomoh overlaid the inside of
the House with refined gold, and made gold chains pass over the front of the
Speaking Place, and overlaid it with gold. 
1Kings
6:22  Thus he overlaid the entire House
with gold, until the entire House was completed. And the entire altar that was
by the Speaking Place he overlaid with gold. 
1Kings
6:23  And inside the Speaking Place he
made two keruḇim of olive wood, ten cubits high. 
1Kings
6:24  And one wing of the keruḇ was
five cubits, and the other wing of the keruḇ five cubits – ten cubits
from the tip of one wing to the tip of the other. 
1Kings
6:25  And the other keruḇ was ten
cubits. Both keruḇim were of the same size and shape. 
1Kings
6:26  The height of one keruḇ was
ten cubits, and so was the other keruḇ. 
1Kings
6:27  And he placed the keruḇim in
the midst of the inner house. And they stretched out the wings of the keruḇim
so that the wing of the one touched one wall, and the wing of the other keruḇ
touched the other wall. And their wings touched each other in the middle of the
room. 
1Kings
6:28  And he overlaid the keruḇim
with gold. 
1Kings
6:29  And he carved all the walls of the
House all around, both inside and outside, with carved figures of keruḇim,
and palm trees, and open flowers. 
1Kings
6:30  And he overlaid the floor of the
House with gold, inside and outside. 
1Kings
6:31  And for the entrance of the
Speaking Place he made doors of olive wood: the lintel, doorposts, a fifth. 
1Kings
6:32  And the two doors were of olive
wood. And he carved on them figures of keruḇim, and palm trees, and open
flowers, and overlaid them with gold. And he spread the gold on the keruḇim
and on the palm trees. 
1Kings
6:33  And so he made doorposts for the
door of the hĕḵal of olive wood – a fourth part. 
1Kings
6:34  And the two doors were of cypress
wood, the two leaves of the one folded, and two leaves of the other door
folded. 
1Kings
6:35  And he carved keruḇim, and
palm trees, and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold laid smoothly on the
carved work. 
1Kings
6:36  And he built the inner courtyard
with three rows of hewn stone and a row of cedar beams. 
1Kings
6:37  In the fourth year the foundation
of the House of יהוה was laid, in the month Ziw. 
1Kings
6:38  And in the eleventh year, in the
month Bul, the eighth month, the house was completed in all its matters and
according to all its plans. Thus he built it for seven years. 
1Kings
7:1  And Shelomoh built his own house for
thirteen years, and he completed his entire house. 
1Kings
7:2  And he built the house of the forest
of Leḇanon. It was one hundred cubits long, and fifty cubits wide, and
thirty cubits high, with four rows of cedar columns, and cedar beams on the
columns. 
1Kings
7:3  And it was panelled with cedar above
the beams that were on forty-five columns, fifteen to a row. 
1Kings
7:4  And there were windows with narrowed
frames in three rows, and window was opposite window, three times. 
1Kings
7:5  And all the doorways and doorposts
had square frames. And window was opposite window, three times. 
1Kings
7:6  And he made the porch of the
columns, fifty cubits long and thirty cubits wide. And the porch was in front
of them, and the columns and the roof was in front of them. 
1Kings
7:7  And he made a hall for the throne,
the Hall of Right-ruling, where he ruled. And it was panelled with cedar from
floor to floor. 
1Kings
7:8  And the house where he was to dwell,
in the other courtyard, within the
hall was of like workmanship. And Shelomoh made a house like this hall for
Pharaoh’s daughter, whom he had taken. 
1Kings
7:9  All these were of precious stone
hewn to size, sawed with a saw, inside and out, from the foundation to the
coping, and also on the outside to the great courtyard. 
1Kings
7:10  And the foundation was of precious
stone, large stones, stones of ten cubits and stones of eight cubits. 
1Kings
7:11  And above were precious stones,
hewn to size, and cedar wood. 
1Kings
7:12  So the great courtyard all around
had three rows of hewn stones and a row of cedar beams, as was the inner
courtyard of the House of יהוה and the porch of the
House. 
1Kings
7:13  And Sovereign Shelomoh sent and
brought Ḥiram from Tsor. 
1Kings
7:14  He was the son of a widow from the
tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tsor, a bronze worker. And he
was filled with wisdom and understanding and skill in working with all kinds of
bronze work. So he came to Sovereign Shelomoh and did all his work. 
1Kings
7:15  And he cast two columns of bronze,
each one eighteen cubits high, and a line of twelve cubits measured the
circumference of each. 
1Kings
7:16  And he made two capitals of cast
bronze, to put on the tops of the columns – the height of one capital was five
cubits, and the height of the other capital was five cubits – 
1Kings
7:17  a lattice network, with wreaths of
chainwork, for the capitals which were on top of the columns, seven chains for
one capital and seven for the other capital. 
1Kings
7:18  And he made the columns, and two
rows of pomegranates above the network all around to cover the capitals that
were on top, and so he did for the other capital. 
1Kings
7:19  And the capitals that were on top
of the columns in the hall were in the shape of lilies, four cubits. 
1Kings
7:20  And there were capitals above also
on the two columns, by the bulge which was next to the network. And the
pomegranates were two hundred, in rows on each of the capitals all around. 
1Kings
7:21  And he set up the columns by the
porch of the hĕḵal. And he set up the column on the right and called
its name Yaḵin, and he set up the column on the left and called its name
Bo‛az. 
1Kings
7:22  And on the top of the columns was
lily work. Thus the work of the columns was completed. 
1Kings
7:23  And he made the Sea of cast metal, ten cubits from one rim to the
other, round all about, and five cubits high, and a line of thirty cubits
measured around it. 
1Kings
7:24  And below its rim were ornaments
all around, ten to a cubit, all the way around the Sea. The ornaments were cast
in two rows when it was cast. 
1Kings
7:25  It stood on twelve oxen, three
facing north, and three facing west, and three facing south, and three facing
east. And the Sea was set upon them, and all their back parts were inward.
1Kings
7:26  And it was a handbreadth thick, and
its rim was shaped like the rim of a cup, like a lily blossom. It held two
thousand baths. 
1Kings
7:27  And he made ten stands of bronze,
each stand was four cubits long, and four cubits wide, and three cubits high. 
1Kings
7:28  And this is how the stands were
made: They had side panels, and the side panels were between frames, 
1Kings
7:29  and on the side panels that were
between the frames were lions, oxen, and keruḇim, and a pedestal above on
the frame. Below the lions and oxen were wreaths of beaten work. 
1Kings
7:30  And each stand had four bronze
wheels and axles of bronze, and its four feet had supports. Under the basin
were cast supports beside each wreath. 
1Kings
7:31  And its opening inside the crown at
the top was one cubit. And the opening was round, like the work of the
pedestal, one and a half cubits. And also on the opening were engravings, but
the side panels were square, not round. 
1Kings
7:32  And the four wheels were under the
side panels, and the axles of the wheels were joined to the stand, and the
height of a wheel was one and a half cubits. 
1Kings
7:33  And the wheels were made like
chariot wheels. Their axle pins, and their rims, and their spokes, and their
hubs were all cast. 
1Kings
7:34  And there were four supports at the
four corners of each stand, its supports were of the stand itself. 
1Kings
7:35  And on the top of the stand, half a
cubit in height – round all around. And on the top of the stand, its flanges
and its side panels were of the same. 
1Kings
7:36  And on the plates of its flanges
and on its side panels he engraved keruḇim, lions, and palm trees,
according to the clear space on each, with wreaths all around. 
1Kings
7:37  He made the ten stands like this:
all of them were of one mould, one measure, and one shape. 
1Kings
7:38  And he made ten basins of bronze;
each basin contained forty baths, and each basin was four cubits, one basin on
each of the ten stands. 
1Kings
7:39  And he put five stands on the right
side of the house, and five on the left side of the house, and he put the Sea
on the right side of the house to the east, facing the south. 
1Kings
7:40  And Ḥiram made the pots and
the shovels and the bowls. And Ḥiram completed doing all the work that he
was to do for Sovereign Shelomoh on the House of יהוה :

1Kings
7:41  the two columns, and the
bowl-shaped capitals that were on top of the columns, and the two networks
covering the two bowl-shaped capitals which were on top of the columns; 
1Kings
7:42  and the four hundred pomegranates
for the two networks, two rows of pomegranates for each network to cover the
two bowl-shaped capitals that were on top of the columns; 
1Kings
7:43  and the ten stands, and the ten
basins on the stands; 
1Kings
7:44  and the one Sea, and twelve oxen
under the Sea; 
1Kings
7:45  and the pots, and the shovels, and
the bowls. And all these utensils which Ḥiram made for Sovereign Shelomoh
for the House of יהוה were of polished bronze. 
1Kings
7:46  The sovereign had them cast in clay
in the district of Yardĕn between Sukkoth and Tsarethan. 
1Kings
7:47  And Shelomoh left all the utensils unweighed, because they were many, nor
was the weight of the bronze searched out. 
1Kings
7:48  So Shelomoh made all the utensils
for the House of יהוה : the altar of gold, and the
table of gold on which was the showbread; 
1Kings
7:49  and the lampstands of refined gold,
five on the right side and five on the left in front of the Speaking Place,
with the flowers and the lamps and the snuffers of gold; 
1Kings
7:50  and the basins, and the snuffers,
and the bowls, and the ladles, and the fire holders of refined gold, and the
hinges of gold, both for the doors of the inner house, the Most Set-apart
Place, and for the doors of the house of the Hĕḵal. 
1Kings
7:51  Thus all the work which Sovereign
Shelomoh had done for the House of יהוה was completed.
And Shelomoh brought in the set-apart items of his father Dawiḏ: the
silver and the gold and the utensils, and he put them in the treasuries of the
House of יהוה.
1Kings
8:1  Then Shelomoh assembled the elders
of Yisra’ĕl and all the heads of the tribes, the chief fathers of the
children of Yisra’ĕl, to Sovereign Shelomoh in Yerushalayim, to bring up
the ark of the covenant of יהוה from the City of Dawiḏ,
which is Tsiyon.  
1Kings
8:2  And all the men of Yisra’ĕl
assembled to Sovereign Shelomoh at the festival in the month of Ĕythanim,
which is the seventh month. 
1Kings
8:3  And all the elders of Yisra’ĕl
came, and the priests took up the ark, 
1Kings
8:4  and brought up the ark of יהוה,
and the Tent of Meeting, and all the set-apart utensils that were in the Tent.
And the priests and the Lĕwites brought them up, 
1Kings
8:5  and Sovereign Shelomoh, and all the
congregation of Yisra’ĕl who had assembled with him, were with him before
the ark, slaughtering so many sheep and cattle, that they could not be counted
or numbered. 
1Kings
8:6  And the priests brought in the ark
of the covenant of יהוה to its place, into the Speaking
Place of the House, to the Most Set-apart Place, under the wings of the keruḇim,

1Kings
8:7  for the keruḇim spread two
wings over the place of the ark, and the keruḇim covered over the ark and
its poles. 
1Kings
8:8  And the poles extended so that the
ends of the poles were seen from the set-apart place, in front of the Speaking
Place, but they were not seen from outside. And they are there to this day. 
1Kings
8:9  There was naught in the ark, only
the two tablets of stone which Mosheh put there at Ḥorĕḇ,
where יהוה made a covenant with the children of Yisra’ĕl,
when they came out of the land of Mitsrayim. 
1Kings
8:10  And it came to be, when the priests
came out of the Set-apart Place, that the cloud filled the House of יהוה,

1Kings
8:11  so that the priests were unable to
stand and perform the service because of the cloud, for the esteem of יהוה
filled the House of יהוה. 
1Kings
8:12  And Shelomoh said, “ יהוה
has said He would dwell in the dark cloud. 
1Kings
8:13  I have indeed built You an exalted
house, an established place for You to dwell in forever.” 
1Kings
8:14  And the sovereign turned around and
blessed all the assembly of Yisra’ĕl, while all the assembly of Yisra’ĕl
was standing. 
1Kings
8:15  And he said, “Blessed be יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, who spoke with His mouth to my father Dawiḏ, and
with His hand has filled it, saying, 
1Kings
8:16  ‘Since the day I brought My people
Yisra’ĕl out of Mitsrayim, I have chosen no city from any tribe of Yisra’ĕl
in which to build a house for My Name to be there, but I chose Dawiḏ to
be over My people Yisra’ĕl.’ 
1Kings
8:17  “And it was in the heart of my
father Dawiḏ to build a house for the Name of יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl. 
1Kings
8:18  “But יהוה
said to my father Dawiḏ, ‘Because it has been in your heart to build a
house for My Name, you did well that it was in your heart. 
1Kings
8:19  ‘Only, you do not build the house,
but your son, who is coming from your loins, he does build the house for My
Name.’ 
1Kings
8:20  “Now יהוה
has established His word which He spoke, and I have been raised up instead of
my father Dawiḏ, and sit on the throne of Yisra’ĕl, as יהוה
promised, and built a house for the Name of יהוה Elohim
of Yisra’ĕl, 
1Kings
8:21  and have appointed there a place
for the ark, wherein is the covenant of יהוה which He
made with our fathers, when He brought them out of the land of Mitsrayim.” 
1Kings
8:22  And Shelomoh stood before the altar
of יהוה in front of all the assembly of Yisra’ĕl,
and spread out his hands toward the heavens, 
1Kings
8:23  and said, “ יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, there is no Elohim in the heavens above or on earth
below like You, guarding Your covenant and kindness with Your servants who walk
before You with all their heart, 
1Kings
8:24  who has guarded that which You did
promise Your servant Dawiḏ my father. Indeed, You have both spoken with
Your mouth and have filled it with Your hand, as it is this day. 
1Kings
8:25  “And now, יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, guard what You promised Your servant Dawiḏ my
father, saying, ‘There is not to cease a man of yours before Me, sitting on the
throne of Yisra’ĕl – only, if your sons guard their way, to walk before Me
as you have walked before Me.’ 
1Kings
8:26  “And now, O Elohim of Yisra’ĕl,
please let Your word come true which You have spoken to Your servant Dawiḏ
my father. 
1Kings
8:27  “For is it true: Elohim dwells on
the earth? See, the heavens and the heavens of the heavens are unable to
contain You, how much less this House which I have built! 
1Kings
8:28  “Yet, shall You turn to the prayer
of Your servant and his supplication, O יהוה my Elohim,
and listen to the cry and the prayer which Your servant is praying before You
today? 
1Kings
8:29  “For Your eyes to be open toward
this House night and day, toward the place of which You said, ‘My Name is
there,’ to listen to the prayer which Your servant makes toward this place. 
1Kings
8:30  “Then, shall You hear the
supplication of Your servant and of Your people Yisra’ĕl when they pray
toward this place, when You hear in Your dwelling place, in the heavens? And
shall You hear, and forgive? 
1Kings
8:31  “If anyone sins against his
neighbour, and he has lifted up an oath on him, to cause him to swear, and
comes and swears before Your altar in this House, 
1Kings
8:32  then hear in the heavens, and act
and rightly rule Your servants, declaring the wrongdoer wrong, bringing his way
on his head, and declaring the righteous right by giving him according to his
righteousness. 
1Kings
8:33  “When Your people Yisra’ĕl are
smitten before an enemy, because they have sinned against You, and they shall
turn back to You and confess Your Name, and pray and make supplication to You
in this House,
1Kings
8:34  then hear in the heavens, and
forgive the sin of Your people Yisra’ĕl, and bring them back to the land
which You gave to their fathers. 
1Kings
8:35  “When the heavens are shut up and
there is no rain because they sin against You, when they pray toward this place
and confess Your Name, and turn from their sin because You afflict them, 
1Kings
8:36  then hear in the heavens, and
forgive the sin of Your servants, Your people Yisra’ĕl – for You teach
them the good way in which they should walk – and shall give rain on Your land
which You have given to Your people as an inheritance. 
1Kings
8:37  “When there is scarcity of food in
the land; when there is pestilence, blight, mildew, locusts, grasshoppers; when
their enemy distresses them in the land of their cities; any plague, any
sickness, 
1Kings
8:38  whatever prayer, whatever
supplication made by anyone of all
Your people Yisra’ĕl, each knowing the plague of his own heart, and shall
spread out his hands toward this House, 
1Kings
8:39  then hear in the heavens, Your
dwelling place, and forgive, and act, and render unto everyone according to all
his ways, whose heart You know. Because You – You alone – know the hearts of
all the sons of men, 
1Kings
8:40  so that they fear You all the days
that they live in the land which You gave to our fathers. 
1Kings
8:41  “Also, concerning a foreigner, who
is not of Your people Yisra’ĕl, but has come from a far land for Your Name’s
sake – 
1Kings
8:42  since they hear of Your great Name
and Your strong hand and Your outstretched arm – and he shall come and pray
toward this House, 
1Kings
8:43  hear in the heavens Your dwelling
place, and do according to all for which the foreigner calls to You, so that
all peoples of the earth know Your Name and fear You, as do Your people Yisra’ĕl,
and know that this House which I have built is called by Your Name. 
1Kings
8:44  “When Your people go out to battle
against their enemy, in the way that You send them, and they shall pray to יהוה
toward the city which You have chosen and toward the House which I have built
for Your Name, 
1Kings
8:45  then shall You hear in the heavens
their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause? 
1Kings
8:46  “When they sin against You – for
there is no one who does not sin – and You become enraged with them and give
them to the enemy, and they take them captive to the land of the enemy, far or
near; 
1Kings
8:47  and they shall turn back unto their
heart in the land where they have been taken captive, and shall turn, and make
supplication to You in the land of those who took them captive, saying, ‘We
have sinned and acted crookedly, we have committed wrong,’ 
1Kings
8:48  and they shall turn back to You
with all their heart and with all their being in the land of their enemies who
led them away captive, and shall pray to You toward their land which You gave
to their fathers, the city which You have chosen and the House which I have
built for Your Name, 
1Kings
8:49  then shall You hear in the heavens
Your dwelling place their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their
cause, 
1Kings
8:50  and forgive Your people who have
sinned against You, and all their transgressions which they have transgressed
against You? And give them compassion before those who took them captive, and
they shall have compassion on them. 
1Kings
8:51  ‘For they are Your people and Your
inheritance, whom You brought out of Mitsrayim, out of the iron furnace. 
1Kings
8:52  “Let Your eyes be open to the
supplication of Your servant and the supplication of Your people Yisra’ĕl,
to listen to them whenever they call to You. 
1Kings
8:53  “For You have separated them unto
Yourself for an inheritance, out of all the peoples of the earth, as You spoke
by the hand of Your servant Mosheh, when You brought our fathers out of
Mitsrayim, O Master יהוה.” 
1Kings
8:54  And it came to be, when Shelomoh
had ended praying all this prayer and supplication to יהוה,
that he rose up from before the altar of יהוה, from
kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to the heavens. 
1Kings
8:55  And he stood and blessed all the
assembly of Yisra’ĕl with a loud voice, saying, 
1Kings
8:56  “Blessed be יהוה,
who has given rest to His people Yisra’ĕl, according to all that He
promised. There has not failed one word of all His good word, which He promised
through His servant Mosheh. 
1Kings
8:57  “ יהוה our
Elohim is with us as He was with our fathers – He does not leave us nor forsake
us – 
1Kings
8:58  to incline our hearts to Himself,
to walk in all His ways, and to guard His commands and His laws and His right-
rulings, which He commanded our fathers.
1Kings
8:59  “And let these words of mine, with
which I have made supplication before יהוה, be near יהוה
our Elohim day and night, to maintain the cause of His servant and the cause of
His people Yisra’ĕl, the matter of each day in its day, 
1Kings
8:60  so that all the peoples of the earth
might know that יהוה is Elohim, there is no one else. 
1Kings
8:61  “Let your heart therefore be
perfect to יהוה our Elohim, to walk in His laws and
guard His commands, as at this day.” 
1Kings
8:62  And the sovereign and all Yisra’ĕl
with him made slaughterings before יהוה. 
1Kings
8:63  And Shelomoh brought peace
offerings, which he slaughtered to יהוה, twenty-two
thousand bulls and one hundred and twenty thousand sheep. Thus the sovereign
and all the children of Yisra’ĕl dedicated the House of יהוה.

1Kings
8:64  On that day the sovereign set apart
the middle of the courtyard that was in front of the House of יהוה,
for there he made burnt offerings, and the grain offerings, and the fat of the
peace offerings, because the bronze altar that was before יהוה
was too small to contain the burnt offerings, and the grain offerings, and the
fat of the peace offerings. 
1Kings
8:65  And Shelomoh at that time observed
the Festival, and all Yisra’ĕl with him, a great assembly from the
entrance of Ḥamath to the wadi of Mitsrayim, before יהוה
our Elohim, seven days and seven days – fourteen days. 
1Kings
8:66  On the eighth day he sent the
people away. And they blessed the sovereign, and went to their tents rejoicing
and glad of heart for all the goodness that יהוה had
done for His servant Dawiḏ, and for Yisra’ĕl His people. 
1Kings
9:1  And it came to be, when Shelomoh had
finished building the House of יהוה and the house of
the sovereign, and all the desire of Shelomoh which he was pleased to do, 
1Kings
9:2  that יהוה
appeared to Shelomoh the second time, as He had appeared to him at Gib‛on.
1Kings
9:3  And יהוה
said to him, “I have heard your prayer and your supplication that you have made
before Me. I have set this house apart which you have built to put My Name
there forever, and My eyes and My heart shall always be there. 
1Kings
9:4  “And you, if you walk before Me as
your father Dawiḏ walked, in integrity of heart and in uprightness, to do
according to all that I have commanded you, if you guard My laws and My
right-rulings, 
1Kings
9:5  then I shall establish the throne of
your reign over Yisra’ĕl forever, as I promised Dawiḏ your father,
saying, ‘There is not to cease a man of yours on the throne of Yisra’ĕl.’ 
1Kings
9:6  “If you at all turn back, you or
your sons, from following Me, and do not guard My commands, My laws, which I
have set before you, but shall go and serve other mighty ones and bow
yourselves to them, 
1Kings
9:7  then I shall cut off Yisra’ĕl
from the face of the soil which I have given them, and send away from My
presence this house which I have set apart for My Name. And Yisra’ĕl shall
be a proverb and a mockery among all the peoples. 
1Kings
9:8  “And this house, which has been
exalted, everyone who passes by it shall be astonished, and hiss, and say, ‘Why
has יהוה done thus to this land and to this house?’ 
1Kings
9:9  “Then they shall say, ‘Because they
have forsaken יהוה their Elohim, who brought their
fathers out of the land of Mitsrayim, and they embraced other mighty ones, and
bowed themselves to them and served them. That is why יהוה
has brought all this evil on them.’ ” 
1Kings
9:10  And it came to be, at the end of
twenty years, that Shelomoh had built the two houses, the House of יהוה
and the house of the sovereign. 
1Kings
9:11  Ḥiram the sovereign of Tsor
had supplied Shelomoh with cedar and cypress and gold, as much as he desired.
Then Sovereign Shelomoh gave Ḥiram twenty cities in the land of Galil. 
1Kings
9:12  And Ḥiram came from Tsor to
see the cities which Shelomoh had given him, but they were not right in his
eyes, 
1Kings
9:13  and he said, “What are these cities
you have given me, my brother?” And he called them the land of Kaḇul, as
they are to this day. 
1Kings
9:14  And Ḥiram sent the sovereign
one hundred and twenty talents of gold. 
1Kings
9:15  And this is the purpose of the
compulsory labour which Sovereign Shelomoh raised, to build the House of יהוה,
and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Yerushalayim, and Ḥatsor,
and Meḡiddo, and Gezer – 
1Kings
9:16  Pharaoh sovereign of Mitsrayim had
gone up and taken Gezer and burned it with fire, and had slain the Kena‛anites
who dwelt in the city, and had given it as a payment for the bride to his
daughter, Shelomoh’s wife – 
1Kings
9:17  and Shelomoh built Gezer, and Lower
Bĕyth Ḥoron, 
1Kings
9:18  and Ba‛alath, and Tamar in
the wilderness, in the land of Yehuḏah, 
1Kings
9:19  and all the storage cities that
Shelomoh had, and cities for his chariots and cities for his cavalry, and
whatever Shelomoh desired to build in Yerushalayim, and in Leḇanon, and
in all the land of his rule. 
1Kings
9:20  All the people who were left of the
Amorites, the Ḥittites, the Perizzites, the Ḥiwwites, and the Yeḇusites,
who were not of the children of Yisra’ĕl – 
1Kings
9:21  their descendants who were left in
the land after them, whom the children of Yisra’ĕl had not been able to
destroy completely – from these Shelomoh raised compulsory labour, as it is to
this day.
1Kings
9:22  But Shelomoh did not make slaves of
the children of Yisra’ĕl, because they were men of battle, and his
servants, and his rulers, and his officers, and commanders of his chariots, and
his cavalry. 
1Kings
9:23  These were the chiefs of the
officials who were over the work of Shelomoh: five hundred and fifty, who ruled
over the people who did the work. 
1Kings
9:24  But the daughter of Pharaoh came up
from the City of Dawiḏ to her house that he built for her. Then he built
Millo. 
1Kings
9:25  And three times a year Shelomoh
brought burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar which he had built for
יהוה, and he burned incense with that which was before יהוה
– thus gave completeness to the House. 
1Kings
9:26  And Sovereign Shelomoh built a fleet
of ships at Etsyon Geḇer, which is near Ĕyloth on the shore of the
Sea of Reeds, in the land of Eḏom.
1Kings
9:27  And Ḥiram sent his servants
with the fleet, seamen who knew the sea, to work with the servants of Shelomoh.

1Kings
9:28  And they went to Ophir, and took
four hundred and twenty talents of gold from there, and brought it to Sovereign
Shelomoh. 
1Kings
10:1  And the sovereigness of Sheḇa
heard of the report of Shelomoh concerning the Name of יהוה,
and came to try him with hard questions. 
1Kings
10:2  And she came to Yerushalayim with a
very great company, with camels that bore spices, very much gold, and precious
stones. And she came to Shelomoh, and she spoke with him about all that was in
her heart. 
1Kings
10:3  And Shelomoh answered all her
questions. There was no matter hidden for the sovereign that he did not make
known to her. 
1Kings
10:4  And the sovereigness of Sheḇa
saw all the wisdom of Shelomoh, and the house that he had built, 
1Kings
10:5  and the food on his table, and the
seating of his servants, and the service of his waiters and their attire, and
his cupbearers, and his burnt offerings which he offered in the House of יהוה,
and there was no more spirit in her. 
1Kings
10:6  Then she said to the sovereign, “The
word I heard in my own land about your words and your wisdom was true. 
1Kings
10:7  “But I did not believe the words
until I came and saw with my own eyes. And see, I have not been told the half!
Your wisdom and prosperity exceed the report which I heard. 
1Kings
10:8  “Blessed are your men and blessed
are these your servants, who stand continually before you, who are hearing your
wisdom! 
1Kings
10:9  “Blessed be יהוה
your Elohim, who delighted in you, to put you on the throne of Yisra’ĕl!
Because יהוה has loved Yisra’ĕl forever, therefore
He made you sovereign, to do right-ruling and righteousness.” 
1Kings
10:10  And she gave the sovereign one
hundred and twenty talents of gold, and very many spices, and precious stones.
Never again did so many spices come as the sovereigness of Sheḇa gave to
Sovereign Shelomoh. 
1Kings
10:11  And also, the ships of Ḥiram,
which brought gold from Ophir, brought almug wood, a great many, and precious
stones from Ophir. 
1Kings
10:12  And the sovereign made steps of
the almug wood for the House of יהוה and for the
sovereign’s house, also lyres and harps for singers. No such almug wood has
come or been seen to this day. 
1Kings
10:13  And Sovereign Shelomoh gave the
sovereigness of Sheḇa all she desired, whatever she asked, besides what
he gave her according to the hand of Sovereign Shelomoh. And she turned and
went to her land, she and her servants. 
1Kings
10:14  And the weight of gold that came
to Shelomoh yearly was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold, 
1Kings
10:15  besides that from men of travel,
and the profit from traders, and from all the sovereigns of Araḇia, and
from the governors of the land. 
1Kings
10:16  And Sovereign Shelomoh made two
hundred large shields of beaten gold – six hundred pieces of gold went into
each shield; 
1Kings
10:17  and three hundred shields of
beaten gold – three minas of gold went into each shield. And the sovereign put
them in the House of the Forest of Leḇanon. 
1Kings
10:18  And the sovereign made a great
throne of ivory, and overlaid it with refined gold. 
1Kings
10:19  The throne had six steps, and the
top of the throne was round at the back, and there were armrests on either side
of the place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the armrests. 
1Kings
10:20  And twelve lions were standing there,
one on each side of the six steps. The like of it was never made in any reign. 
1Kings
10:21  And all the drinking vessels of
Sovereign Shelomoh were of gold, and all the vessels of the House of the Forest
of Leḇanon were of refined gold – not of silver, for this was reckoned of
little value in the days of Shelomoh. 
1Kings
10:22  For the sovereign had ships of
Tarshish at sea with the fleet of Ḥiram. Once every three years the ships
of Tarshish came bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and baboons. 
1Kings
10:23  And Sovereign Shelomoh was greater
than any of the sovereigns of the earth in riches and wisdom. 
1Kings
10:24  And all the earth sought the
presence of Shelomoh to hear his wisdom, which Elohim had put in his heart.
1Kings
10:25  And they were each bringing his
present: objects of silver and objects of gold, and garments, and armour, and
spices, horses, and mules, the matter of a year by year. 
1Kings
10:26  And Shelomoh gathered chariots and
horsemen, and he had one thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand
horsemen, whom he stationed in the chariot cities and with the sovereign in
Yerushalayim. 
1Kings
10:27  And the sovereign made silver as
common in Yerushalayim as stones, and he made cedars as plenty as the sycamores
which are in the low country. 
1Kings
10:28  And Shelomoh had horses brought
out from Mitsrayim and Quĕh; the sovereign’s merchants bought them in Quĕh
at a price. 
1Kings
10:29  And a chariot came up and went out
from Mitsrayim for six hundred pieces of silver, and a horse one hundred and
fifty. And so, by their hand, they brought them out to all the sovereigns of
the Ḥittites and the sovereigns of Aram. 
1Kings
11:1  And Sovereign Shelomoh loved many
foreign women in addition to the daughter of Pharaoh: Mo’aḇite, Ammonite,
Eḏomite, Tsiḏonian, and Ḥittite women; 
1Kings
11:2  from the nations of whom יהוה
had said to the children of Yisra’ĕl, “You do not go into them, and they
do not go into you, for they shall certainly turn away your hearts after their
mighty ones.” Shelomoh clung to these in love. 
1Kings
11:3  And he had seven hundred wives,
princesses, and three hundred concubines. And his wives turned away his heart. 
1Kings
11:4  And it came to be, when Shelomoh
was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other mighty ones. And his
heart was not perfect with יהוה his Elohim, as was the
heart of his father Dawiḏ. 
1Kings
11:5  And Shelomoh went after Ashtoreth
the mighty one of the Tsiḏonians, and after Milkom the abomination of the
Ammonites.
1Kings
11:6  Thus Shelomoh did evil in the eyes
of יהוה, and did not follow יהוה
completely, like his father Dawiḏ. 
1Kings
11:7  Then Shelomoh built a high place
for Kemosh the abomination of Mo’aḇ, on the hill that is east of
Yerushalayim, and for Moleḵ the abomination of the children of Ammon. 
1Kings
11:8  And so he did for all his foreign
wives, who burned incense and slaughtered to their mighty ones. 
1Kings
11:9  Therefore יהוה
was enraged with Shelomoh, because his heart had turned away from יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, who had appeared to him twice, 
1Kings
11:10  and had commanded him concerning
this word, not to go after other mighty ones. But he did not guard what יהוה
had commanded.
1Kings
11:11  And יהוה
said to Shelomoh, “Because you have done this, and have not guarded My covenant
and My laws, which I have commanded you, I shall certainly tear the reign away
from you and give it to your servant. 
1Kings
11:12  “Only, I do not do it in your
days, for the sake of your father Dawiḏ. Out of the hand of your son I
shall tear it. 
1Kings
11:13  “Only, I shall not tear away all
the reign but give one tribe to your son for the sake of my servant Dawiḏ,
and for the sake of Yerushalayim which I have chosen.” 
1Kings
11:14  And יהוה
raised up an adversary against Shelomoh, Haḏaḏ the Eḏomite.
He was of the seed of the sovereign in Eḏom. 
1Kings
11:15  And it came to be, when Dawiḏ
was in Eḏom, and Yo’aḇ the commander of the army had gone up to
bury the slain, after he had smitten every male in Eḏom – 
1Kings
11:16  Yo’aḇ remained there with
all Yisra’ĕl for six months, until every male in Eḏom was cut off – 
1Kings
11:17  that Haḏaḏ fled to go
to Mitsrayim, he and certain Eḏomites of his father’s servants with him,
while Haḏaḏ was still a little child. 
1Kings
11:18  And they arose from Miḏyan
and came to Paran, and took men with them from Paran and came to Mitsrayim, to
Pharaoh sovereign of Mitsrayim, who gave him a house, and ordered food for him,
and gave him land. 
1Kings
11:19  And Haḏaḏ found much
favour in the eyes of Pharaoh, so that he gave him as wife the sister of his
own wife, the sister of Sovereigness Taḥpenĕs.
1Kings
11:20  And the sister of Taḥpenĕs
bore him Genuḇath his son, whom Taḥpenĕs weaned in Pharaoh’s
house. And Genuḇath was in the house of Pharaoh among the sons of
Pharaoh. 
1Kings
11:21  And Haḏaḏ heard in
Mitsrayim that Dawiḏ slept with his fathers, and that Yo’aḇ the
commander of the army was dead, and Haḏaḏ said to Pharaoh, “Let me
go to my land.” 
1Kings
11:22  And Pharaoh said to him, “But what
have you lacked with me, that you are now seeking to go to your own land?” And
he answered, “No, but please let me go.” 
1Kings
11:23  And Elohim raised up another
adversary against him, Rezon son of Elyaḏa who had fled from his master,
Haḏaḏezer sovereign of Tsoḇah, 
1Kings
11:24  and gathered men to him and became
commander over a raiding band, when Dawiḏ slew those of Tsoḇah. And
they went to Damascus and dwelt there, and reigned in Damascus. 
1Kings
11:25  And he was an adversary of Yisra’ĕl
all the days of Shelomoh – besides the trouble that Haḏaḏ caused –
and he was hostile to Yisra’ĕl and reigned over Aram. 
1Kings
11:26  And a servant of Shelomoh, Yaroḇ‛am
son of Neḇat, an Ephrayimite from Tserĕḏah, whose mother’s
name was Tseru‛ah, a widow, also lifted up a hand against the sovereign. 
1Kings
11:27  And this is what caused him to
lift up a hand against the sovereign: Shelomoh had built Millo, repairing the
breaks in the City of Dawiḏ his father. 
1Kings
11:28  And the man Yaroḇ‛am
was a brave man. And Shelomoh, seeing that the young man was doing his work
well, made him the officer over all the compulsory labour of the house of Yosĕph.

1Kings
11:29  And it came to be at that time,
when Yaroḇ‛am went out of Yerushalayim, that the prophet
Aḥiyah the Shilonite met him on the way. And he was wearing a new
garment, and the two were alone in the field. 
1Kings
11:30  And Aḥiyah took hold of the
new garment that was on him, and tore it into twelve pieces, 
1Kings
11:31  and said to Yaroḇ‛am, “Take
for yourself ten pieces, for thus said יהוה, the Elohim
of Yisra’ĕl, ‘See, I am tearing the reign out of the hand of Shelomoh and
shall give ten tribes to you, 
1Kings
11:32  but he shall have one tribe for
the sake of My servant Dawiḏ, and for the sake of Yerushalayim, the city
which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Yisra’ĕl. 
1Kings
11:33  ‘Because they have forsaken Me,
and bow themselves to Ashtoreth the mighty one of the Tsiḏonians, to
Kemosh the mighty one of the Mo’aḇites, and to Milkom the mighty one of
the children of Ammon, and have not walked in My ways – to do what is right in
My eyes, and My laws and My right-rulings, as did his father Dawiḏ. 
1Kings
11:34  ‘But I do not take all the reign
out of his hand, because I have made him ruler all the days of his life for the
sake of My servant Dawiḏ, whom I chose because he guarded My commands and
My laws. 
1Kings
11:35  ‘And I shall take the reign out of
his son’s hand and give it to you, the ten tribes. 
1Kings
11:36  ‘And to his son I give one tribe,
so that My servant Dawiḏ shall always have a lamp before Me in
Yerushalayim, the city which I have chosen for Myself, to put My Name there. 
1Kings
11:37  ‘So I take you, and you shall
reign over all that your being desires, and you shall be sovereign over Yisra’ĕl.

1Kings
11:38  ‘And it shall be, if you obey all
that I command you, and shall walk in My ways, and do what is right in My eyes,
to guard My laws and My commands, as My servant Dawiḏ did, then I shall
be with you and build for you a steadfast house, as I built for Dawiḏ,
and shall give Yisra’ĕl to you.
1Kings
11:39  ‘And because of this I humble the
seed of Dawiḏ, but not forever.’ ” 
1Kings
11:40  And Shelomoh sought to kill Yaroḇ‛am,
but Yaroḇ‛am rose up and fled to Mitsrayim, to Shishaq sovereign of
Mitsrayim, and was in Mitsrayim until the death of Shelomoh. 
1Kings
11:41  And the rest of the acts of
Shelomoh, all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the book of
the acts of Shelomoh? 
1Kings
11:42  And the days that Shelomoh reigned
in Yerushalayim over all Yisra’ĕl was forty years. 
1Kings
11:43  So Shelomoh slept with his
fathers, and was buried in the City of Dawiḏ his father, and Reḥaḇ‛am
his son reigned in his place. 
1Kings
12:1  And Reḥaḇ‛am went
to Sheḵem, for all Yisra’ĕl had gone to Sheḵem to set him up
to reign. 
1Kings
12:2  And it came to be, when Yaroḇ‛am
son of Neḇat heard this – he was still in Mitsrayim, for he had fled from
the presence of Sovereign Shelomoh and had been dwelling in Mitsrayim – 
1Kings
12:3  that they sent and called him. And
Yaroḇ‛am and all the assembly of Yisra’ĕl came and spoke to
Reḥaḇ‛am, saying, 
1Kings
12:4  “Your father made our yoke hard,
and now, lighten the hard service of your father, and his heavy yoke which he
put on us, then we serve you.” 
1Kings
12:5  And he said to them, “Go away for
three days, then come back to me.” And the people went. 
1Kings
12:6  Then Sovereign Reḥaḇ‛am
consulted the elders who stood before his father Shelomoh while he still lived,
and he said, “What do you advise me to answer these people?” 
1Kings
12:7  And they spoke to him, saying, “If
you are a servant to these people today, and shall serve them, and shall answer
them and speak good words to them, then they shall be your servants all the
days.” 
1Kings
12:8  But he ignored the advice the
elders gave him, and consulted the young men who had grown up with him, who
stood before him. 
1Kings
12:9  And he said to them, “What advice
do you give? How should we answer this people who have spoken to me, saying, ‘Lighten
the yoke which your father put on us’?”
1Kings
12:10  And the young men who had grown up
with him spoke to him, saying, “Say this to this people who have spoken to you,
saying, ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, but you make it lighter on us.’ Say
this to them, ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s waist! 
1Kings
12:11  ‘And now, my father laid a heavy
yoke on you, but I add to your yoke; my father flogged you with whips, but I, I
flog you with scourges!’ ” 
1Kings
12:12  So Yaroḇ‛am and all
the people came to Reḥaḇ‛am the third day, as the sovereign
had spoken, saying, “Come back to me the third day.” 
1Kings
12:13  But the sovereign answered the
people harshly, and ignored the advice which the elders had given him, 
1Kings
12:14  and he spoke to them according to
the advice of the young men, saying, “My father made your yoke heavy, but I add
to your yoke; my father flogged you with whips, but I, I flog you with
scourges!” 
1Kings
12:15  So the sovereign did not listen to
the people, for the turn of events
was from יהוה, in order to establish His word, which יהוה
had spoken by Aḥiyah the Shilonite to Yaroḇ‛am son of Neḇat.

1Kings
12:16  And all Yisra’ĕl saw that the
sovereign did not listen to them. Then the people answered the sovereign,
saying, “What portion do we have in Dawiḏ? And there is no inheritance in
the son of Yishai. To your mighty ones, O Yisra’ĕl! Now, see to your own
house, O Dawiḏ!” So Yisra’ĕl went to their tents. 
1Kings
12:17  But as for the children of Yisra’ĕl
who dwelt in the cities of Yehuḏah, Reḥaḇ‛am reigned
over them. 
1Kings
12:18  And when Sovereign Reḥaḇ‛am
sent Aḏoram, who was over the compulsory labour, all Yisra’ĕl stoned
him with stones, and he died. And Sovereign Reḥaḇ‛am hastily
mounted his chariot to flee to Yerushalayim. 
1Kings
12:19  Thus Yisra’ĕl revolted
against the house of Dawiḏ to this day. 
1Kings
12:20  And it came to be when all Yisra’ĕl
heard that Yaroḇ‛am had come back, they sent for him and called him
to the congregation, and set him up to reign over all Yisra’ĕl. There was
none who followed the house of Dawiḏ, except the tribe of Yehuḏah
only.
1Kings
12:21  And Reḥaḇ‛am
came to Yerushalayim, and he assembled all the house of Yehuḏah with the
tribe of Binyamin, one hundred and eighty thousand chosen brave men, to fight
against the house of Yisra’ĕl, to bring back the reign to Reḥaḇ‛am
son of Shelomoh. 
1Kings
12:22  But the word of Elohim came to
Shemayah the man of Elohim, saying, 
1Kings
12:23  “Speak to Reḥaḇ‛am
son of Shelomoh, sovereign of Yehuḏah, and to all the house of Yehuḏah
and Binyamin, and to the rest of the people, saying, 
1Kings
12:24  ‘Thus said יהוה,
“Do not go up or fight against your brothers the children of Yisra’ĕl. Let
every man return to his house, for this matter is from Me.” ’ ” So they obeyed
the word of יהוה, and turned back, according to the
word of יהוה. 
1Kings
12:25  And Yaroḇ‛am built Sheḵem
in the mountains of Ephrayim, and dwelt there. And he went out from there and
built Penu’ĕl. 
1Kings
12:26  And Yaroḇ‛am said in
his heart, “Now the reign shall return to the house of Dawiḏ. 
1Kings
12:27  “If these people go up to do
slaughterings in the House of יהוה at Yerushalayim,
then the heart of this people shall turn back to their master, Reḥaḇ‛am
sovereign of Yehuḏah, and they shall slay me and go back to Reḥaḇ‛am
sovereign of Yehuḏah.” 
1Kings
12:28  So the sovereign took counsel and
made two calves of gold, and said to the people, “It is too much for you to go
up to Yerushalayim. See, your mighty ones, O Yisra’ĕl, which brought you
up from the land of Mitsrayim!”
1Kings
12:29  And he set up one in Bĕyth Ĕl,
and the other he put in Dan. 
1Kings
12:30  And this matter became a sin, for
the people went before the one as far as Dan. 
1Kings
12:31  And he made the house of high
places, and made priests from all sorts of people, who were not of the sons of
Lĕwi. 
1Kings
12:32  And Yaroḇ‛am performed
a festival on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, like the festival that was
in Yehuḏah, and he offered on the altar. So he did at Bĕyth Ĕl,
slaughtering to the calves that he had made. And at Bĕyth Ĕl he
appointed the priests of the high places which he had made. 
1Kings
12:33  And he made offerings on the altar
which he had made at Bĕyth Ĕl on the fifteenth day of the eighth
month, in the month which he had devised in his own heart. And he performed a
festival for the children of Yisra’ĕl, and offered on the altar and burned
incense. 
1Kings
13:1  And see, a man of Elohim went from
Yehuḏah to Bĕyth Ĕl by the word of יהוה,
while Yaroḇ‛am was standing by the altar to burn incense. 
1Kings
13:2  And he cried out against the altar
by the word of יהוה, and said, “O altar, altar! Thus
said יהוה, ‘See, a son is to be born to the house of
Dawiḏ, Yoshiyahu is his name. And on you he shall offer the priests of
the high places who burn incense on you, and men’s bones be burned on you.’ ” 
1Kings
13:3  And he gave a sign the same day,
saying, “This is the sign which יהוה has spoken: See,
the altar is split apart, and the ashes on it is poured out.” 
1Kings
13:4  And it came to be when Sovereign
Yaroḇ‛am heard the saying of the man of Elohim, who cried out
against the altar in Bĕyth Ĕl, that he stretched out his hand from
the altar, saying, “Seize him!” Then his hand, which he stretched out toward
him, dried up, so that he was unable to bring it back to him. 
1Kings
13:5  And the altar was split apart, and
the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of
Elohim had given by the word of יהוה. 
1Kings
13:6  And the sovereign answered and said
to the man of Elohim, “Please appease the face of יהוה
your Elohim, and pray for me, that my hand might be restored to me.” And the
man of Elohim appeased the face of יהוה, and the
sovereign’s hand was restored to him, and became as it was before. 
1Kings
13:7  The sovereign then said to the man
of Elohim, “Come home with me and refresh yourself, and I give you a gift.” 
1Kings
13:8  But the man of Elohim said to the
sovereign, “If you were to give me half your house, I do not go in with you,
nor do I eat bread nor drink water in this place. 
1Kings
13:9  “For so He commanded me by the word
of יהוה, saying, ‘Do not eat bread, nor drink water,
nor return by the same way you came.’ ” 
1Kings
13:10  So he went another way and did not
return by the way he came to Bĕyth Ĕl. 
1Kings
13:11  And a certain old prophet was
dwelling in Bĕyth Ĕl, and his sons came and told him all the works
that the man of Elohim had done that day in Bĕyth Ĕl, the words which
he had spoken to the sovereign. 
1Kings
13:12  And their father said to them, “Which
way did he go?” And his sons had seen which way the man of Elohim went who came
from Yehuḏah. 
1Kings
13:13  And he said to his sons, “Saddle
the donkey for me.” And they saddled the donkey for him, and he rode on it, 
1Kings
13:14  and went after the man of Elohim,
and found him sitting under a terebinth. And he said to him, “Are you the man
of Elohim who came from Yehuḏah?” And he said, “I am.”
1Kings
13:15  And he said to him, “Come home
with me and eat bread.” 
1Kings
13:16  And he said, “I am not able to
return with you or to go in with you, nor am I to eat bread or drink water with
you in this place. 
1Kings
13:17  “For word came to me by the word
of יהוה, ‘Do not eat bread nor drink water there, nor
return by going the way you came.’ ” 
1Kings
13:18  And he said to him, “I too am a
prophet like you, and a messenger spoke to me by the word of יהוה,
saying, ‘Bring him back with you to your house, and let him eat bread and drink
water.’ ” But he lied to him. 
1Kings
13:19  So he turned back with him, and
ate bread in his house, and drank water. 
1Kings
13:20  And it came to be, as they sat at
the table, that the word of יהוה came to the prophet
who had brought him back, 
1Kings
13:21  and he cried out to the man of
Elohim who came from Yehuḏah, saying, “Thus said יהוה,
‘Because you have rebelled against the mouth of יהוה,
and have not guarded the command which יהוה your Elohim
commanded you, 
1Kings
13:22  and turned back, and ate bread,
and drank water in the place of which He said to you, “Do not eat bread nor
drink water,” your body shall not enter the burying-place of your fathers.’ ” 
1Kings
13:23  And it came to be, after he had
eaten bread and after he had drunk, that he saddled the donkey for him, for the
prophet whom he had brought back. 
1Kings
13:24  And he went, and a lion met him on
the way and killed him. And his body was thrown on the way. And the donkey was
standing by it, and the lion was standing by the body. 
1Kings
13:25  And see, men were passing by and
saw the body thrown on the way, while the lion was standing by the body. And
they went and reported it in the city where the old prophet dwelt. 
1Kings
13:26  And the prophet who had brought
him back from the way heard it, and said, “It is the man of Elohim who rebelled
against the mouth of יהוה, and יהוה
gave him to the lion, and it tore him apart and killed him, according to the
word of יהוה which He spoke to him.” 
1Kings
13:27  And he spoke to his sons, saying, “Saddle
the donkey for me.” And they saddled it. 
1Kings
13:28  So he went and found his body
thrown on the way, and the donkey and the lion standing by the body. The lion
had not eaten the body nor mauled the donkey. 
1Kings
13:29  And the prophet lifted up the body
of the man of Elohim, and placed it on the donkey, and brought it back. And the
old prophet came to the city to mourn, and to bury him, 
1Kings
13:30  and he placed his body in his own
tomb. And they lamented over him, saying, “Oh, my brother!” 
1Kings
13:31  And it came to be, after he had
buried him, that he spoke to his sons, saying, “When I am dead, then you shall
bury me in the tomb where the man of Elohim is buried. Lay my bones beside his
bones. 
1Kings
13:32  “For the word which he cried out,
by the word of יהוה, against the altar in Bĕyth Ĕl,
and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of
Shomeron, shall certainly come to be.” 
1Kings
13:33  After this event Yaroḇ‛am
did not turn from his evil way, but again he made priests from all sorts of
people for the high places. Whoever wished, he ordained, to become one of the
priests of the high places. 
1Kings
13:34  And this matter was the sin of the
house of Yaroḇ‛am, even to cut it off and destroy it from the face
of the earth. 
1Kings
14:1  At that time Aḇiyah the son
of Yaroḇ‛am became sick. 
1Kings
14:2  And Yaroḇ‛am said to
his wife, “Please arise, and disguise yourself, so they do not know that you
are the wife of Yaroḇ‛am, and go to Shiloh. See, Aḥiyah the
prophet is there, who spoke to me of becoming
sovereign over this people. 
1Kings
14:3  “And you shall take with you ten
loaves, and cakes, and a jar of honey, and go to him. Let him declare to you
what becomes of the child.” 
1Kings
14:4  And Yaroḇ‛am’s wife did
so, and rose up and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Aḥiyah. But
Aḥiyahu was unable to see, for his eyes had set because of his age. 
1Kings
14:5  And יהוה
had said to Aḥiyahu, “See, the wife of Yaroḇ‛am is coming to
ask you a word about her son, for he is sick. Speak to her thus and thus. For
it shall be, when she comes in, that she makes herself strange.” 
1Kings
14:6  And it came to be, when
Aḥiyahu heard the sound of her footsteps as she came through the door, he
said, “Come in, wife of Yaroḇ‛am. Why are you making yourself
strange? And I have been sent to you with a hard word. 
1Kings
14:7  Go, say to Yaroḇ‛am, ‘Thus
said יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, “Because I exalted
you from among the people, and made you ruler over My people Yisra’ĕl, 
1Kings
14:8  and tore the reign away from the
house of Dawiḏ, and gave it to you – and you have not been as My servant
Dawiḏ, who guarded My commands and who followed Me with all his heart, to
do only what was right in My eyes, 
1Kings
14:9  but you have done more evil than
all who were before you, for you have gone and made for yourself other mighty
ones and moulded images to provoke Me, and have cast Me behind your back – 
1Kings
14:10  therefore, see, I am bringing evil
to the house of Yaroḇ‛am, and shall cut off from Yaroḇ‛am
every male in Yisra’ĕl, whether shut up or left at large, and sweep away
the remnant of the house of Yaroḇ‛am, as one sweeps away dung until
it is all gone. 
1Kings
14:11  Those of Yaroḇ‛am who
die in the city the dogs do eat, and those who die in the field the birds of
the heavens do eat, for יהוה has spoken it!” ’ 
1Kings
14:12  “And you, arise, go to your house.
When your feet enter the city, the child shall die. 
1Kings
14:13  “And all Yisra’ĕl shall mourn
for him and bury him, for he is the only one of Yaroḇ‛am who shall
come to the grave, because in him there is found a good report toward יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, in the house of Yaroḇ‛am. 
1Kings
14:14  “And יהוה
shall raise up for Himself a sovereign over Yisra’ĕl who cuts off the
house of Yaroḇ‛am, this day, and even now!
1Kings
14:15  “And יהוה
shall smite Yisra’ĕl, as a reed is shaken in the water, and shall pluck
Yisra’ĕl from this good soil which He gave to their fathers, and shall
scatter them beyond the River, because they made their Ashĕrim, provoking יהוה,

1Kings
14:16  and He shall give Yisra’ĕl
up, because of the sins of Yaroḇ‛am, who sinned and who made Yisra’ĕl
sin.” 
1Kings
14:17  And the wife of Yaroḇ‛am
rose up and went, and came to Tirtsah. When she came to the threshold of the
house, the child died. 
1Kings
14:18  And they buried him, and all Yisra’ĕl
lamented for him, according to the word of יהוה which
He spoke through His servant Aḥiyahu the prophet. 
1Kings
14:19  And the rest of the acts of Yaroḇ‛am,
how he fought and how he reigned, see, they are written in the book of the
annals of the sovereigns of Yisra’ĕl. 
1Kings
14:20  And the days that Yaroḇ‛am
reigned was twenty-two years. So he slept with his fathers, and Naḏaḇ
his son reigned in his place. 
1Kings
14:21  Meanwhile Reḥaḇ‛am
son of Shelomoh reigned in Yehuḏah. Reḥaḇ‛am was
forty-one years old when he became sovereign, and he reigned seventeen years in
Yerushalayim, the city which יהוה had chosen out of all
the tribes of Yisra’ĕl, to put His Name there. And his mother’s name was
Na‛amah the Ammonitess. 
1Kings
14:22  And Yehuḏah did evil in the
eyes of יהוה, and they provoked Him to jealousy with
their sins which they committed, more than all that their fathers had done. 
1Kings
14:23  For they also built for themselves
high places, and pillars, and Ashĕrim on every high hill and under every
green tree. 
1Kings
14:24  And there were also cult
prostitutes in the land. They did according to all the abominations of the gentiles
which יהוה dispossessed before the children of Yisra’ĕl.

1Kings
14:25  And it came to be, in the fifth
year of Sovereign Reḥaḇ‛am, that Shishaq sovereign of
Mitsrayim came up against Yerushalayim. 
1Kings
14:26  And he took away the treasures of
the House of יהוה and the treasures of the sovereign’s
house, he even took away all. And he took away all the shields of gold which
Shelomoh had made. 
1Kings
14:27  And Sovereign Reḥaḇ‛am
made shields of bronze to replace them, and entrusted them into the hands of
the chiefs of the guard, who guarded the entrance of the sovereign’s house. 
1Kings
14:28  And it came to be, whenever the
sovereign went into the House of יהוה, the guards would
bring them, then take them back into the guardroom. 
1Kings
14:29  And the rest of the acts of
Reḥaḇ‛am, and all that he did, are they not written in the
book of the annals of the sovereigns of Yehuḏah? 
1Kings
14:30  And there was fighting between
Reḥaḇ‛am and Yaroḇ‛am all the days. 
1Kings
14:31  So Reḥaḇ‛am
slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the City of Dawiḏ.
And the name of his mother was Na‛amah the Ammonitess. And Aḇiyam
his son reigned in his place. 
1Kings
15:1  And in the eighteenth year of
Sovereign Yaroḇ‛am son of Neḇat, Aḇiyam became
sovereign over Yehuḏah. 
1Kings
15:2  He reigned three years in
Yerushalayim, and his mother’s name was Ma‛aḵah the granddaughter
of Aḇishalom. 
1Kings
15:3  And he walked in all the sins of
his father, which he had done before him, and his heart was not perfect to יהוה
his Elohim, as was the heart of his father Dawiḏ. 
1Kings
15:4  But for Dawiḏ’s sake יהוה
his Elohim gave him a lamp in Yerushalayim, to raise up his son after him and
by establishing Yerushalayim, 
1Kings
15:5  for Dawiḏ did what was right
in the eyes of יהוה, and did not turn aside from all
that He commanded him all the days of his life, except in the matter of Uriyah
the Ḥittite. 
1Kings
15:6  And there was fighting between
Reḥaḇ‛am and Yaroḇ‛am all the days of his life. 
1Kings
15:7  And the rest of the acts of Aḇiyam,
and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the
sovereigns of Yehuḏah? And there was fighting between Aḇiyam and
Yaroḇ‛am. 
1Kings
15:8  So Aḇiyam slept with his
fathers, and they buried him in the City of Dawiḏ. And Asa his son
reigned in his place. 
1Kings
15:9  And in the twentieth year of Yaroḇ‛am
sovereign of Yisra’ĕl, Asa became sovereign over Yehuḏah. 
1Kings
15:10  And he reigned forty-one years in
Yerushalayim, and his grandmother’s name was Ma‛aḵah the
granddaughter of Aḇishalom. 
1Kings
15:11  And Asa did what was right in the
eyes of יהוה, as his father Dawiḏ had done, 
1Kings
15:12  and put away the cult prostitutes
from the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made. 
1Kings
15:13  And he also removed Ma‛aḵah
his grandmother from being sovereigness mother, because she had made an
abominable image for Ashĕrah. And Asa cut down her abominable image and
burned it by the wadi Qiḏron. 
1Kings
15:14  But the high places were not
removed. However, Asa’s heart was perfect with יהוה all
his days. 
1Kings
15:15  And he brought into the House of יהוה
the set-apart items of his father, and his own set-apart items: silver and gold
and utensils. 
1Kings
15:16  And there was fighting between Asa
and Ba‛asha sovereign of Yisra’ĕl all their days. 
1Kings
15:17  And Ba‛asha sovereign of
Yisra’ĕl came up against Yehuḏah, and built Ramah, to keep anyone
from going out or coming in to Asa sovereign of Yehuḏah. 
1Kings
15:18  And Asa took all the silver and
gold that was left in the treasuries of the House of יהוה
and the treasuries of the sovereign’s house, and gave them into the hand of his
servants. And Sovereign Asa sent them to Ben-Haḏaḏ son of Taḇrimmon,
son of Ḥezyon, sovereign of Aram, who dwelt in Damascus, saying, 
1Kings
15:19  “Let there be a covenant between
you and me, as there was between my father and your father. Look, I have sent
you a present of silver and gold. Come, break your covenant with Ba‛asha
sovereign of Yisra’ĕl, so that he withdraws from me.” 
1Kings
15:20  And Ben-Haḏaḏ listened
to Sovereign Asa, and sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of
Yisra’ĕl, and smote Iyon, and Dan, and Aḇĕl Bĕyth Ma‛aḵah,
and all Kinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali. 
1Kings
15:21  And it came to be, when Ba‛asha
heard it, that he stopped building Ramah, and remained in Tirtsah. 
1Kings
15:22  Then Sovereign Asa summoned all
Yehuḏah – none was exempted – and they took away the stones and timber of
Ramah, which Ba‛asha had used for building. And with them Sovereign Asa
built Geḇa of Binyamin, and Mitspah. 
1Kings
15:23  And the rest of all the acts of
Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, are
they not written in the book of the annals of the sovereigns of Yehuḏah?
But in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet. 
1Kings
15:24  So Asa slept with his fathers, and
was buried with his fathers in the City of Dawiḏ his father. And
Yehoshaphat his son reigned in his place. 
1Kings
15:25  And Naḏaḇ son of Yaroḇ‛am
became sovereign over Yisra’ĕl in the second year of Asa sovereign of Yehuḏah,
and he reigned over Yisra’ĕl two years. 
1Kings
15:26  And he did evil in the eyes of יהוה,
and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin by which he had made Yisra’ĕl
sin. 
1Kings
15:27  Then Ba‛asha son of
Aḥiyah, of the house of Yissasḵar, conspired against him. And Ba‛asha
smote him at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines, for Naḏaḇ
and all Yisra’ĕl had laid siege to Gibbethon. 
1Kings
15:28  And Ba‛asha killed him in
the third year of Asa sovereign of Yehuḏah, and reigned in his place. 
1Kings
15:29  And it came to be, when he became
sovereign, that he smote all the house of Yaroḇ‛am. He did not
leave to Yaroḇ‛am anyone breathing, until he had destroyed him,
according to the word of יהוה which He had spoken by
His servant Aḥiyah the Shilonite, 
1Kings
15:30  because of the sins of Yaroḇ‛am,
which he had sinned and by which he had made Yisra’ĕl sin, because of his
provocation with which he had provoked יהוה Elohim of
Yisra’ĕl. 
1Kings
15:31  And the rest of the acts of Naḏaḇ,
and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the
sovereigns of Yisra’ĕl? 
1Kings
15:32  And there was fighting between Asa
and Ba‛asha sovereign of Yisra’ĕl all their days. 
1Kings
15:33  In the third year of Asa sovereign
of Yehuḏah, Ba‛asha son of Aḥiyah became sovereign over all
Yisra’ĕl in Tirtsah, and reigned twenty-four years. 
1Kings
15:34  And he did evil in the eyes of יהוה,
and walked in the way of Yaroḇ‛am, and in his sin by which he had
made Yisra’ĕl sin. 
1Kings
16:1  Then the word of יהוה
came to Yĕhu son of Ḥanani, against Ba‛asha, saying,
1Kings
16:2  “Because I raised you up out of the
dust and made you ruler over My people Yisra’ĕl, but you walked in the way
of Yaroḇ‛am, and made My people Yisra’ĕl sin, to provoke Me
with their sins, 
1Kings
16:3  see, I am going to sweep away Ba‛asha
and his house, and shall make your house like the house of Yaroḇ‛am
the son of Neḇat. 
1Kings
16:4  “Anyone belonging to Ba‛asha
who dies in a city the dogs eat, and anyone belonging to him who dies in a
field the birds of the heavens eat.” 
1Kings
16:5  And the rest of the acts of Ba‛asha,
what he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the annals of
the sovereigns of Yisra’ĕl? 
1Kings
16:6  So Ba‛asha slept with his
fathers and was buried in Tirtsah. And his son Ĕlah reigned in his place. 
1Kings
16:7  Moreover, the word of יהוה
came by the prophet Yĕhu son of Ḥanani against Ba‛asha and his
house, because of all the evil that he did in the eyes of יהוה
in provoking Him with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Yaroḇ‛am,
and because he smote them. 
1Kings
16:8  In the twenty-sixth year of Asa
sovereign of Yehuḏah, Ĕlah son of Ba‛asha began to reign over
Yisra’ĕl in Tirtsah, two years.
1Kings
16:9  And his servant Zimri, commander of
half his chariots, conspired against him as he was in Tirtsah drinking himself
drunk in the house of Artsa, who was over his house in Tirtsah. 
1Kings
16:10  Then Zimri came in and smote him
and killed him in the twenty-seventh year of Asa sovereign of Yehuḏah,
and reigned in his place. 
1Kings
16:11  And it came to be, when he began
to reign, as soon as he was seated on his throne, that he smote all the
household of Ba‛asha. He did not leave him one male, neither of his
relatives nor of his friends. 
1Kings
16:12  So Zimri destroyed the entire
house of Ba‛asha, according to the word of יהוה,
which He spoke against Ba‛asha by Yĕhu the prophet, 
1Kings
16:13  for all the sins of Ba‛asha
and the sins of Ĕlah his son, by which they had sinned and by which they
had made Yisra’ĕl sin, in provoking יהוה Elohim of
Yisra’ĕl with their worthlessnesses. 
1Kings
16:14  And the rest of the acts of Ĕlah,
and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the
sovereigns of Yisra’ĕl? 
1Kings
16:15  In the twenty-seventh year of Asa
sovereign of Yehuḏah, Zimri reigned seven days in Tirtsah. And the people
were encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines. 
1Kings
16:16  And the people who were encamped
heard it said, “Zimri has conspired and also smote the sovereign.” So all Yisra’ĕl
set up Omri, the commander of the army, to reign over Yisra’ĕl that day in
the camp. 
1Kings
16:17  And Omri went up, and all Yisra’ĕl
with him, from Gibbethon, and they besieged Tirtsah. 
1Kings
16:18  And it came to be, when Zimri saw
that the city was captured, that he went into a high place of the sovereign’s
house and burned the sovereign’s house down upon himself with fire, and died, 
1Kings
16:19  because of the sins which he had
sinned in doing evil in the eyes of יהוה, in walking in
the way of Yaroḇ‛am, and in his sin which he had committed to make
Yisra’ĕl sin. 
1Kings
16:20  And the rest of the acts of Zimri,
and the conspiracy he made, are they not written in the book of the annals of
the sovereigns of Yisra’ĕl? 
1Kings
16:21  Then the people of Yisra’ĕl
were divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tiḇni son of
Ginath, to make him reign, and half followed Omri. 
1Kings
16:22  But the people who followed Omri
were stronger than the people who followed Tiḇni son of Ginath. And Tiḇni
died and Omri reigned. 
1Kings
16:23  In the thirty-first year of Asa
sovereign of Yehuḏah, Omri became sovereign over Yisra’ĕl, and
reigned twelve years. He reigned six years in Tirtsah. 
1Kings
16:24  And he bought the hill of Shomeron
from Shemer for two talents of silver, and built on the hill, and called the
name of the city which he built, Shomeron, after the name of Shemer, owner of
the hill. 
1Kings
16:25  And Omri did evil in the eyes of יהוה,
and did evil more than all those before him, 
1Kings
16:26  and walked in all the ways of Yaroḇ‛am
son of Neḇat, and in his sin by which he had made Yisra’ĕl sin,
provoking יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl with their
worthlessnesses. 
1Kings
16:27  And the rest of the acts of Omri
which he did, and the might that he attained, are they not written in the book of
the annals of the sovereigns of Yisra’ĕl? 
1Kings
16:28  So Omri slept with his fathers and
was buried in Shomeron. And Aḥaḇ his son reigned in his place. 
1Kings
16:29  In the thirty-eighth year of Asa
sovereign of Yehuḏah, Aḥaḇ son of Omri became sovereign over
Yisra’ĕl. And Aḥaḇ son of Omri reigned over Yisra’ĕl in
Shomeron twenty-two years. 
1Kings
16:30  And Aḥaḇ son of Omri
did evil in the eyes of יהוה, more than all those
before him. 
1Kings
16:31  And it came to be, as though it
had been a light matter for him to walk in the sins of Yaroḇ‛am son
of Neḇat, that he took as wife Izeḇel the daughter of Ethba‛al,
sovereign of the Tsiḏonians. And he went and served Ba‛al and bowed
himself to it, 
1Kings
16:32  and raised up an altar for Ba‛al
in the house of Ba‛al, which he had built in Shomeron. 
1Kings
16:33  And Aḥaḇ made an Ashĕrah.
And Aḥaḇ did more to provoke יהוה Elohim of
Yisra’ĕl than all the sovereigns of Yisra’ĕl before him. 
1Kings
16:34  In his days Ḥi’ĕl of Bĕyth
Ĕl built Yeriḥo. He laid its foundation at the cost of Aḇiram
his first-born, and at the cost of his youngest son Seḡuḇ he set up
its gates, according to the word of יהוה, which He had
spoken through Yehoshua son of Nun.  
1Kings
17:1  And Ĕliyahu the Tishbite, of
the inhabitants of Gil‛aḏ, said to Aḥaḇ, “As יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl lives, before whom I stand, there shall be no dew or
rain these years, except at my word.” 
1Kings
17:2  And the word of יהוה
came to him, saying, 
1Kings
17:3  “Go away from here and turn
eastward, and hide by the wadi Kerith, which flows into the Yardĕn. 
1Kings
17:4  “And it shall be that you drink
from the stream, and I shall command the ravens to feed you there.” 
1Kings
17:5  And he went and did according to
the word of יהוה, for he went and dwelt by the wadi
Kerith, which flows into the Yardĕn. 
1Kings
17:6  And the ravens brought him bread
and meat in the morning, and bread and meat in the evening, and he drank from
the stream. 
1Kings
17:7  And it came to be after a while
that the stream dried up, because there had been no rain in the land. 
1Kings
17:8  Then the word of יהוה
came to him, saying, 
1Kings
17:9  “Rise up, go to Tsarephath, which
belongs to Tsiḏon, and dwell there. See, I have commanded a widow there
to sustain you.” 
1Kings
17:10  And he rose up and went to
Tsarephath, and came to the gate of the city and saw a widow there gathering
sticks. And he called and said to her, “Please bring me a little water in a
vessel to drink.” 
1Kings
17:11  And as she was going to get it, he
called and said to her, “Please bring me a piece of bread in your hand.” 
1Kings
17:12  And she said, “As יהוה
your Elohim lives, I do not have bread, only a handful of flour in a bin, and a
little oil in a jar. And see, I am gathering a couple of sticks and shall go in
and prepare it for myself and my son, and we shall eat it, and die.” 
1Kings
17:13  And Ĕliyah said to her, “Do
not fear, go and do as you have said, but make me a small cake from it first,
and bring it to me. And afterward make some for yourself and your son. 
1Kings
17:14  “For thus said יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, ‘The bin of flour shall not be used up, nor the jar of
oil run dry, until the day יהוה sends rain on the
earth.’ ” 
1Kings
17:15  So she went and did according to
the word of Ĕliyahu, and she and he and her household ate for many days. 
1Kings
17:16  The bin of flour was not used up,
nor did the jar of oil run dry, according to the word of יהוה
which He spoke by Ĕliyahu. 
1Kings
17:17  And after these events it came to
be that the son of the woman who owned the house became sick. And his sickness
was very severe until there was no breath left in him.
1Kings
17:18  And she said to Ĕliyahu, “What
have I to do with you, O man of Elohim? Have you come to me to bring my
crookedness to be remembered, and to kill my son?” 
1Kings
17:19  And he said to her, “Give me your
son.” So he took him from her arms and took him to the upper room where he was
dwelling, and laid him on his own bed, 
1Kings
17:20  and cried out to יהוה
and said, “O יהוה my Elohim, have You also brought evil
on the widow with whom I am sojourning, to kill her son?” 
1Kings
17:21  And he stretched himself out on
the child three times, and cried out to יהוה and said, “O
יהוה my Elohim, I pray, let the life of this child come
back to him.” 
1Kings
17:22  And יהוה
heard the voice of Ĕliyahu, and the life of the child came back to him,
and he lived. 
1Kings
17:23  And Ĕliyahu took the child
and brought him down from the upper room into the house, and gave him to his
mother. And Ĕliyahu said, “See, your son lives!” 
1Kings
17:24  And the woman said to Ĕliyahu,
“Now by this I know that you are a man of Elohim, and that the word of יהוה
in your mouth is truth.” 
1Kings
18:1  And after many days it came to be
that the word of יהוה came to Ĕliyahu, in the
third year, saying, “Go, present yourself to Aḥaḇ, and I give rain
on the earth.” 
1Kings
18:2  Thereupon Ĕliyahu went to
present himself to Aḥaḇ. And the scarcity of food in Shomeron was
severe. 
1Kings
18:3  And Aḥaḇ had called Oḇaḏyahu,
who was over his house. Now Oḇaḏyahu feared יהוה
exceedingly. 
1Kings
18:4  And it came to be, while Izeḇel
cut down the prophets of יהוה, that Oḇaḏyahu
had taken one hundred prophets and hidden them, fifty to a cave, and had fed
them with bread and water. 
1Kings
18:5  And Aḥaḇ had said to Oḇaḏyahu,
“Go into the land to all the springs of water and to all the wadis, it could be
that we find grass to keep the horses and mules alive, and not have any
livestock cut off. 
1Kings
18:6  And they divided the land between
them to pass over it, Aḥaḇ went one way by himself, and Oḇaḏyahu
went another way by himself. 
1Kings
18:7  And as Oḇaḏyahu was on
his way, then see, Ĕliyahu met him. And he recognised him, and fell on his
face, and said, “Is that you, my master Ĕliyahu?” 
1Kings
18:8  And he answered him, “It is I. Go,
say to your master, ‘Ĕliyahu is here.’ ” 
1Kings
18:9  And he said, “What have I sinned,
that you are giving your servant into the hand of Aḥaḇ, to kill me?

1Kings
18:10  “As יהוה
your Elohim lives, there is no nation or reign where my master has not sent to
look for you. And when they said, ‘He is not here,’ he made the reign or nation
swear that they could not find you. 
1Kings
18:11  “And now you say, ‘Go, say to your
master, “Ĕliyahu is here” ’! 
1Kings
18:12  “And it shall be, as soon as I am
gone from you, that the Spirit of יהוה takes you away
to a place I do not know. And I shall come to report to Aḥaḇ, and
when he does not find you, he shall kill me. But I your servant have feared יהוה
from my youth. 
1Kings
18:13  “Was it not reported to my master
what I did when Izeḇel slew the prophets of יהוה,
how I hid one hundred men of the prophets of יהוה,
fifty to a cave, and fed them with bread and water? 
1Kings
18:14  “And now you say, ‘Go, say to your
master, “Ĕliyahu is here!” ’ Then he shall slay me.” 
1Kings
18:15  And Ĕliyahu said, “As יהוה
of hosts lives, before whom I stand, I shall indeed show myself to him today.” 
1Kings
18:16  Oḇaḏyahu then went to
meet Aḥaḇ and informed him, and Aḥaḇ went to meet Ĕliyahu.

1Kings
18:17  And it came to be, when Aḥaḇ
saw Ĕliyahu, that Aḥaḇ said to him, “Is that you, O disturber
of Yisra’ĕl?” 
1Kings
18:18  And he answered, “I have not
disturbed Yisra’ĕl, but you and your father’s house, in that you have
forsaken the commands of יהוה, and you have followed
the Ba‛als. 
1Kings
18:19  “And now, send and gather all
Yisra’ĕl to me on Mount Karmel, the four hundred and fifty prophets of Ba‛al,
and the four hundred prophets of Ashĕrah, who eat at Izeḇel’s table.”

1Kings
18:20  Aḥaḇ then sent for all
the children of Yisra’ĕl, and gathered the prophets on Mount Karmel. 
1Kings
18:21  And Ĕliyahu came to all the
people, and said, “How long would you keep hopping between two opinions? If יהוה
is Elohim, follow Him; and if Ba‛al, follow him.” But the people answered
him not a word.
1Kings
18:22  And Ĕliyahu said to the
people, “I alone am left a prophet of יהוה, but the
prophets of Ba‛al are four hundred and fifty men. 
1Kings
18:23  “Now let them give us two bulls.
And let them choose one bull for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it
on the wood, but set no fire. And I, I prepare the other bull, and shall lay it
on the wood, but set no fire. 
1Kings
18:24  “And you shall call on the name of
your mighty one, and I, I call on the Name of יהוה. And
the Elohim who answers by fire, He is Elohim.” So all the people answered and
said, “The word is good.” 
1Kings
18:25  And Ĕliyahu said to the
prophets of Ba‛al, “Choose one bull for yourselves and prepare it first,
for you are many. And call on the name of your mighty one, but set no fire.” 
1Kings
18:26  So they took the bull which was
given them, and prepared it, and called on the name of Ba‛al from morning
even until noon, saying, “O Ba‛al, answer us!” But there was no voice and
no one answered. And they leaped about the altar which they had made. 
1Kings
18:27  And it came to be at noon, that Ĕliyahu
taunted them and said, “Cry aloud, for he is a mighty one; he is meditating, or
he is busy, or he is on a journey, or it could be that he is asleep and has to
be awakened!” 
1Kings
18:28  And they cried aloud, and cut
themselves, according to their ruling, with knives and spears, until the blood
gushed out on them. 
1Kings
18:29  And it came to be when midday was
past, that they prophesied until the time of bringing the evening offering. But there was no voice and no one answered, and
no one paying attention. 
1Kings
18:30  Then Ĕliyahu said to all the
people, “Come closer to me.” And all the people came closer to him. And he
repaired the altar of יהוה that was broken down. 
1Kings
18:31  And Ĕliyahu took twelve
stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Ya‛aqoḇ,
to whom the word of יהוה had come, saying, “Yisra’ĕl
is your name.” 
1Kings
18:32  And with the stones he built an
altar in the Name of יהוה. And he made a trench around
the altar large enough to hold two seahs of seed. 
1Kings
18:33  And he arranged the wood, and cut
the bull in pieces, and laid it on the wood, and said, “Fill four jars with
water, and pour it on the burnt offering and on the wood.” 
1Kings
18:34  Then he said, “Do it a second
time,” and they did it a second time. And he said, “Do it a third time,” and
they did it a third time. 
1Kings
18:35  And the water flowed around the
altar, and he filled the trench with water too. 
1Kings
18:36  And it came to be, at the time of
bringing the evening offering, that Ĕliyahu
the prophet came near and said, “ יהוה Elohim of Aḇraham,
Yitsḥaq, and Yisra’ĕl, let it be known today: You are Elohim in
Yisra’ĕl, and I Your servant, have done all these matters by Your word. 
1Kings
18:37  “Answer me, O יהוה,
answer me, and let this people know that You are יהוה
Elohim, and You shall turn their hearts back to You again.” 
1Kings
18:38  Then the fire of יהוה
fell and consumed the burnt offering, and the wood and the stones and the dust,
and it licked up the water that was in the trench. 
1Kings
18:39  And all the people saw, and fell
on their faces, and said, “ יהוה, He is the Elohim! יהוה,
He is the Elohim!” 
1Kings
18:40  And Ĕliyahu said to them, “Seize
the prophets of Ba‛al! Do not let one of them escape!” So they seized
them, and Ĕliyahu brought them down to the wadi Qishon and slaughtered
them there. 
1Kings
18:41  And Ĕliyahu said to Aḥaḇ,
“Go up, eat and drink, because of the sound of the noise of rain.” 
1Kings
18:42  And Aḥaḇ went up to
eat and to drink. And Ĕliyahu went up to the top of Karmel, and he bowed
down on the ground, and put his face between his knees, 
1Kings
18:43  and said to his servant, “Go up,
please, look closely toward the sea.” So he went up and looked closely, and
said, “Not a speck.” And seven times he said, “Go again.”
1Kings
18:44  And it came to be the seventh
time, that he said, “See, a little cloud as small as a man’s hand is coming out
of the sea!” And he said, “Go up, say to Aḥaḇ, ‘Hitch up, and go
down before the rain stops you.’ ” 
1Kings
18:45  And in the meantime, it came to be
that the heavens became black with clouds and wind, and there was a heavy rain,
while Aḥaḇ rode and went to Yizre‛ĕl. 
1Kings
18:46  And the hand of יהוה
was on Ĕliyahu. And he girded up his loins and ran ahead of Aḥaḇ
to the entrance of Yizre‛ĕl. 
1Kings
19:1  And when Aḥaḇ reported
to Izeḇel all that Ĕliyahu had done, also how he slew all the
prophets with the sword, 
1Kings
19:2  Izeḇel sent a messenger to Ĕliyahu,
saying, “So let the mighty ones do to me, and more also, if I do not make your
life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time.” 
1Kings
19:3  And he feared, and rose up and ran
for his life, and went to Be’ĕrsheḇa, which belongs to Yehuḏah,
and left his servant there. 
1Kings
19:4  But he himself went a day’s journey
into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a broom tree, and prayed that
he might die, and said, “It is enough! Now, יהוה, take
my life, for I am no better than my fathers!” 
1Kings
19:5  And he lay and slept under a broom
tree, and see, a messenger touched him, and said to him, “Rise, eat.” 
1Kings
19:6  And he looked and saw by his head a
cake baked on coals, and a jar of water. So he ate and drank, and turned and
lay down. 
1Kings
19:7  And the messenger of יהוה
came back the second time, and touched him, and said, “Rise, eat, for the
journey is too much for you.” 
1Kings
19:8  And he rose up and ate and drank,
and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights as far as Ḥorĕḇ,
the mountain of Elohim. 
1Kings
19:9  And there he went into a cave and
spent the night there. And see, the word of יהוה came
to him, and said to him, “What are you doing here, Ĕliyahu?” 
1Kings
19:10  And he said, “I have been very
jealous for יהוה Elohim of hosts, for the children of
Yisra’ĕl have forsaken Your covenant. They have thrown down Your altars,
and they have slain Your prophets with the sword, and I am left, I alone, and
they seek my life, to take it.” 
1Kings
19:11  And He said, “Go out, and stand on
the mountain before יהוה.” And see, יהוה
passed by, and a great and strong wind tearing the mountains and breaking the
rocks in pieces before יהוה – יהוה
was not in the wind. And after the wind an earthquake – יהוה
was not in the earthquake, 
1Kings
19:12  and after the earthquake a fire – יהוה
was not in the fire, and after the fire a still small voice. 
1Kings
19:13  And it came to be, when Ĕliyahu
heard it, that he wrapped his face in his robe and went out and stood at the
cave opening. And see, a voice came to him, and said, “What are you doing here,
Ĕliyahu?” 
1Kings
19:14  And he said, “I have been very
jealous for יהוה Elohim of hosts, for the children of
Yisra’ĕl have forsaken Your covenant. They have thrown down Your altars,
and they have slain Your prophets with the sword, and I am left, I alone, and
they seek my life, to take it.” 
1Kings
19:15  And יהוה
said to him, “Go, return on your way to the Wilderness of Damascus. And you
shall go in and anoint Ḥaza’ĕl as sovereign over Aram. 
1Kings
19:16  “And anoint Yĕhu son of
Nimshi as sovereign over Yisra’ĕl. And anoint Elisha son of Shaphat of Aḇĕl
Meḥolah as prophet in your place. 
1Kings
19:17  “And it shall be that whoever
escapes the sword of Ḥaza’ĕl, Yĕhu does kill. And whoever
escapes from the sword of Yĕhu, Elisha does kill. 
1Kings
19:18  “And I shall leave seven thousand
in Yisra’ĕl, all whose knees have not bowed to Ba‛al, and every
mouth that has not kissed him.” 
1Kings
19:19  And he went from there, and found
Elisha son of Shaphat, who was ploughing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he was with the twelfth. And Ĕliyahu
passed by him and threw his robe on him. 
1Kings
19:20  And he left the oxen and ran after
Ĕliyahu, and said, “Please let me kiss my father and my mother, and then I
follow you.” And he said to him, “Go, turn back, for what have I done to you?” 
1Kings
19:21  And he turned back from him, and
took a yoke of oxen and slaughtered them and cooked their flesh, using the
implements of the oxen, and gave it to the people, and they ate. Then he rose
up and followed Ĕliyahu, and became his servant. 
1Kings
20:1  And Ben-Haḏaḏ the
sovereign of Aram gathered all his army, and there were thirty-two sovereigns
with him, with horses and chariots. And he went up and besieged Shomeron, and
fought against it. 
1Kings
20:2  And he sent messengers into the
city to Aḥaḇ sovereign of Yisra’ĕl, and said to him, “Thus
said Ben-Haḏaḏ, 
1Kings
20:3  ‘Your silver and your gold are
mine, and your wives and children, the best, are mine.’ ” 
1Kings
20:4  And the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl
answered and said, “As you say, my master, O sovereign, I am yours, and all
that I have.” 
1Kings
20:5  And the messengers came back and
said, “Thus speaks Ben-Haḏaḏ, saying, ‘Indeed I have sent to you,
saying, “Give me your silver and your gold, your wives and your children,” 
1Kings
20:6  but about this time tomorrow I
shall send my servants to you, and they shall search your house and the houses
of your servants. And it shall be, that whatever is pleasing in your eyes they
shall lay hold of and take it.’ ” 
1Kings
20:7  And the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl
called all the elders of the land, and said, “Please know and see the evil this
one is seeking, for he sent to me for my wives, and for my children, and for my
silver, and for my gold, and I did not refuse him.” 
1Kings
20:8  And all the elders and all the
people said to him, “Do not listen nor agree.” 
1Kings
20:9  So he said to the messengers of
Ben-Haḏaḏ, “Say to my master the sovereign, ‘All that you sent for
to your servant the first time I shall do, but this I am unable to do.’ ” And
the messengers went and brought back word to him. 
1Kings
20:10  And Ben-Haḏaḏ sent to
him and said, “The mighty ones do so to me, and more also, if enough dust is
left of Shomeron for a handful for each of the people who follow me.”
1Kings
20:11  And the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl
answered and said, “Speak, ‘Him who girds on his armour should not boast like him who lays it down.’ ” 
1Kings
20:12  And it came to be when this word
was heard, as he and the sovereigns were drinking in the booths, that he said
to his servants, “Set yourselves.” So they set themselves against the city. 
1Kings
20:13  And see, a prophet came near to
Aḥaḇ sovereign of Yisra’ĕl, saying, “Thus said יהוה,
‘Have you seen all this great company? See, I am giving it into your hand
today, and you shall know that I am יהוה.’ ”
1Kings
20:14  And Aḥaḇ said, “By
whom?” And he said, “Thus said יהוה, ‘By the young
rulers of the provinces.’ ” And he said, “Who opens the attack?” Then he
answered, “You.” 
1Kings
20:15  And he mustered the young rulers
of the provinces, and there were two hundred and thirty-two. And after them he
mustered all the people, all the children of Yisra’ĕl, seven thousand. 
1Kings
20:16  And they went out at noon, while
Ben-Haḏaḏ and the thirty-two sovereigns helping him were getting
drunk in the booths. 
1Kings
20:17  And the young rulers of the
provinces went out first. And Ben-Haḏaḏ sent out, and they reported
to him, saying, “Men have come out of Shomeron!” 
1Kings
20:18  Then he said, “If they have come
out for peace, seize them alive. And if they have come out for battle, seize
them alive.” 
1Kings
20:19  So these young rulers of the
provinces went out of the city with the army which followed them. 
1Kings
20:20  And each smote his man, so the
Arameans fled, and Yisra’ĕl pursued them. And Ben-Haḏaḏ the
sovereign of Aram escaped on a horse with the horsemen. 
1Kings
20:21  And the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl
went out and smote the horses and chariots, and smote the Arameans, a great
smiting. 
1Kings
20:22  And the prophet came to the
sovereign of Yisra’ĕl and said to him, “Go, strengthen yourself. And know
and see what you should do, for at the turn of the year the sovereign of Aram
is coming up against you.” 
1Kings
20:23  And the servants of the sovereign
of Aram said to him, “Their mighty ones are mighty ones of the hills. That is
why they were stronger than we. But let us fight against them in the plain –
are we not stronger than they? 
1Kings
20:24  “Now do this: Take away the
sovereigns, each from his position, and put officers in their places, 
1Kings
20:25  and number an army like the army
that you have lost, horse for horse and chariot for chariot, and let us fight
against them in the plain – are we not stronger than they?” And he listened to
their voice and did so. 
1Kings
20:26  And it came to be, at the turn of
the year, that Ben-Haḏaḏ mustered the Arameans and went up to Aphĕq
to fight against Yisra’ĕl. 
1Kings
20:27  And the children of Yisra’ĕl
were mustered and were fed, and they went against them. And the children of
Yisra’ĕl encamped before them like two little flocks of goats, while the
Arameans filled the land. 
1Kings
20:28  And there came near a man of
Elohim and spoke to the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl, and said, “Thus said יהוה,
‘Because the Arameans have said, “ יהוה is Elohim of
the hills, but He is not Elohim of the valleys,” therefore I shall give all
this great company into your hand, and you shall know that I am יהוה.’
” 
1Kings
20:29  And they encamped opposite each
other for seven days. And it came to be that on the seventh day the battle was
joined. And the children of Yisra’ĕl smote one hundred thousand foot
soldiers of the Arameans in one day. 
1Kings
20:30  And those that were left fled to
Aphĕq, into the city, and a wall fell on twenty-seven thousand of the men
who were left. And Ben-Haḏaḏ fled and went into the city, into an
inner room. 
1Kings
20:31  And his servants said to him, “See
now, we have heard that the sovereigns of the house of Yisra’ĕl are kind
sovereigns. Please, let us put sackcloth around our waists and ropes around our
heads, and go out to the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl. It could be that he spares
your life.”
1Kings
20:32  So they girded sackcloth on their
loins and put ropes around their heads, and came to the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl
and said, “Your servant Ben-Haḏaḏ said, ‘Please let me live.’ ” And
he said, “Is he still alive? He is my brother.” 
1Kings
20:33  And the men divined and they
quickly grasped it and said, “Your brother Ben-Haḏaḏ.” And he said,
“Go, bring him.” So Ben-Haḏaḏ came out to him, and he let him come
up on the chariot. 
1Kings
20:34  And Ben-Haḏaḏ said to
him, “The cities which my father took from your father I return. And set up
market-places for yourself in Damascus, as my father did in Shomeron.” And
Aḥaḇ said, “I send you away with this covenant.” And he made a
covenant with him and sent him away.
1Kings
20:35  And a certain man of the sons of
the prophets said to his neighbour by the word of יהוה,
“Smite me, please.” But the man refused to smite him. 
1Kings
20:36  Then he said to him, “Because you
have not obeyed the voice of יהוה, see, as soon as you
leave me a lion shall smite you.” And when he left him, a lion found him and
smote him. 
1Kings
20:37  And he found another man, and said,
“Smite me, please.” So the man smote him, smiting and wounding. 
1Kings
20:38  Then the prophet went and waited
for the sovereign by the way, and disguised himself with ashes on his eyes. 
1Kings
20:39  And as the sovereign passed by, he
cried out to the sovereign and said, “Your servant went out into the midst of
the battle. And see, a man came over and brought a man to me, and said, ‘Guard
this man. If he should in any way be missing, your life shall be for his life,
or else you shall pay a talent of silver.’ 
1Kings
20:40  “And it came to be, while your
servant was busy here and there, he was gone.” And the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl
said to him, “Your judgment is right, you yourself have decided it.” 
1Kings
20:41  Then he quickly removed the ashes
from his eyes. And the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl recognised him as one of the
prophets. 
1Kings
20:42  And he said to him, “Thus said יהוה,
‘Because you have let slip out of your hand a man whom I put under the ban,
therefore your life shall go for his life, and your people for his people.’ ” 
1Kings
20:43  And the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl
went to his house embittered and displeased, and came to Shomeron. 
1Kings
21:1  And it came to be, after these
events, that Naḇoth the Yizre‛ĕlite had a vineyard which was
in Yizre‛ĕl, near the palace of Aḥaḇ the sovereign of
Shomeron. 
1Kings
21:2  And Aḥaḇ spoke to Naḇoth,
saying, “Give me your vineyard, and it shall be a vegetable garden for me,
since it adjoins my house. And let me give you a better vineyard for it. If it
is good in your eyes, let me give you its worth in silver.” 
1Kings
21:3  And Naḇoth said to Aḥaḇ,
“Far be it from me, by יהוה, that I should give the
inheritance of my fathers to you!” 
1Kings
21:4  And Aḥaḇ went into his
house embittered and displeased because of the word which Naḇoth the
Yizre‛ĕlite had spoken to him when he said, “I do not give you the
inheritance of my fathers.” And he lay down on his bed, and turned away his
face, and did not eat food. 
1Kings
21:5  And Izeḇel his wife came to
him, and said to him, “Why is your spirit so embittered that you are not eating
food?” 
1Kings
21:6  And he said to her, “Because I
spoke to Naḇoth the Yizre‛ĕlite, and said to him, ‘Give me
your vineyard for silver, or if you prefer, I give you another vineyard for it.’
But he answered, ‘I do not give you my vineyard.’ ” 
1Kings
21:7  So Izeḇel his wife said to
him, “Do you now rule over Yisra’ĕl? Rise up, eat food, and let your heart
be glad. Let me give you the vineyard of Naḇoth the Yizre‛ĕlite!”

1Kings
21:8  Then she wrote letters in Aḥaḇ’s
name, and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters to the elders and the
nobles who were dwelling in the city with Naḇoth. 
1Kings
21:9  And she wrote in the letters,
saying, “Proclaim a fast, and seat Naḇoth at the head of the people, 
1Kings
21:10  and seat two men, sons of Beliya‛al
before him to bear witness against him, saying, ‘You have blasphemed Elohim and
the sovereign.’ Then you shall take him out, and stone him to death.” 
1Kings
21:11  And the men of his city, the
elders and nobles who were inhabitants of his city, did as Izeḇel had
sent to them, as it was written in the letters which she had sent to them. 
1Kings
21:12  They proclaimed a fast, and seated
Naḇoth at the head of the people. 
1Kings
21:13  And the men, sons of Beliya‛al,
came in and sat before him. And the men of Beliya‛al witnessed against
him, against Naḇoth, in the presence of the people, saying, “Naḇoth
has blasphemed Elohim and the sovereign!” So they took him outside the city and
stoned him with stones, and he died. 
1Kings
21:14  And they sent to Izeḇel,
saying, “Naḇoth has been stoned and is dead.” 
1Kings
21:15  And it came to be, when Izeḇel
heard that Naḇoth had been stoned and was dead, that Izeḇel said to
Aḥaḇ, “Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naḇoth the
Yizre‛ĕlite, which he refused to give you for money, for Naḇoth
is not alive but dead.” 
1Kings
21:16  And it came to be, when Aḥaḇ
heard that Naḇoth was dead, that Aḥaḇ rose to go down to take
possession of the vineyard of Naḇoth the Yizre‛ĕlite.
1Kings
21:17  And the word of יהוה
came to Ĕliyahu the Tishbite, saying, 
1Kings
21:18  “Rise up, go down to meet
Aḥaḇ sovereign of Yisra’ĕl, who lives in Shomeron. See, he is
in the vineyard of Naḇoth, where he has gone down to take possession of
it. 
1Kings
21:19  “And you shall speak to him,
saying, ‘Thus said יהוה, “Have you murdered and also
taken possession?” ’ And you shall speak to him, saying, ‘Thus said יהוה,
“In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naḇoth, the dogs are going
to lick your blood, even yours.” ’ ” 
1Kings
21:20  And Aḥaḇ said to Ĕliyahu,
“Have you found me, O my enemy?” And he answered, “I have found you, because
you have sold yourself to do evil in the eyes of יהוה :

1Kings
21:21  ‘See, I am bringing evil on you,
and shall consume your descendants, and cut off from Aḥaḇ every
male in Yisra’ĕl, both those shut up and those left at large, 
1Kings
21:22  and make your house like the house
of Yaroḇ‛am son of Neḇat, and like the house of Ba‛asha
son of Aḥiyah, because of the provocation with which you have provoked
Me, and made Yisra’ĕl sin.’
1Kings
21:23  “And also of Izeḇel יהוה
has spoken, saying, ‘The dogs are going to eat Izeḇel by the wall of
Yizre‛ĕl.’ 
1Kings
21:24  “The dogs are going to eat whoever
belongs to Aḥaḇ and dies in the city, and the birds of the heavens
are going to eat whoever dies in the field.” 
1Kings
21:25  Indeed, there never was anyone
like Aḥaḇ who sold himself to do evil in the eyes of יהוה,
because Izeḇel his wife stirred him up. 
1Kings
21:26  And he acted very abominably in
following idols, according to all that the Amorites had done, whom יהוה
dispossessed from before the children of Yisra’ĕl. 
1Kings
21:27  And it came to be, when Aḥaḇ
heard those words, that he tore his garments and put sackcloth on his body, and
fasted and lay in sackcloth, and went softly. 
1Kings
21:28  And the word of יהוה
came to Ĕliyahu the Tishbite, saying, 
1Kings
21:29  “See how Aḥaḇ has
humbled himself before Me? Because he has humbled himself before Me, I do not
bring the evil in his days, but in the days of his son I bring the evil on his
house.” 
1Kings
22:1  And they continued three years
without fighting between Aram and Yisra’ĕl. 
1Kings
22:2  And it came to be, in the third
year, that Yehoshaphat sovereign of Yehuḏah came down to the sovereign of
Yisra’ĕl. 
1Kings
22:3  And the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl
said to his servants, “Do you know that Ramoth in Gil‛aḏ is ours,
and we are keeping silent from taking it out of the hand of the sovereign of
Aram!” 
1Kings
22:4  And he said to Yehoshaphat, “Do you
go with me to battle at Ramoth Gil‛aḏ?” And Yehoshaphat said to the
sovereign of Yisra’ĕl, “I am as you are, my people as your people, my
horses as your horses.” 
1Kings
22:5  And Yehoshaphat said to the
sovereign of Yisra’ĕl, “Please, first inquire for the word of יהוה.”

1Kings
22:6  And the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl
gathered the prophets, about four hundred men, and said to them, “Do I go
against Ramoth Gil‛aḏ to battle, or do I refrain?” And they said, “Go
up, for יהוה does give it into the hand of the
sovereign.” 
1Kings
22:7  And Yehoshaphat said, “Is there not
here a prophet of יהוה besides, that we might inquire of
him?” 
1Kings
22:8  And the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl
said to Yehoshaphat, “There is still one man, Miḵayehu son of Yimlah, to
inquire of יהוה by him. But I hate him, because he does
not prophesy good concerning me, but evil.” And Yehoshaphat said, “Let not the
sovereign say so!” 
1Kings
22:9  So the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl
called an officer and said, “Bring Miḵayehu son of Yimlah at once!” 
1Kings
22:10  And the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl
and Yehoshaphat sovereign of Yehuḏah were sitting, each on his throne,
dressed in their robes, at a threshing-floor at the entrance of the gate of
Shomeron. And all the prophets were prophesying before them. 
1Kings
22:11  And Tsiḏqiyah son of Kena‛anah
had made horns of iron for himself, and said, “Thus said יהוה,
‘With these you push the Arameans until they are destroyed.’ ” 
1Kings
22:12  And all the prophets were
prophesying so, saying, “Go up to Ramoth Gil‛aḏ and prosper, for יהוה
shall give it into the hand of the sovereign.” 
1Kings
22:13  And the messenger who had gone to
call Miḵayehu spoke to him, saying, “See now, the words of the prophets
with one mouth are good towards the sovereign. Please, let your word be like
the word of one of them, and you shall speak good.” 
1Kings
22:14  And Miḵayehu said, “As יהוה
lives, whatever יהוה says to me, that I speak.” 
1Kings
22:15  And he came to the sovereign, and
the sovereign said to him, “Miḵayehu, do we go against Ramoth Gil‛aḏ
to battle, or do we refrain?” And he answered him, “Go and prosper, for יהוה
shall give it into the hand of the sovereign!” 
1Kings
22:16  And the sovereign said to him, “How
many times have I made you swear that you do not speak to me, except the truth,
in the Name of יהוה ?”
1Kings
22:17  So he said, “I saw all Yisra’ĕl
scattered on the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd. And יהוה
said, ‘These have no master. Let everyone return to his house in peace.’ ” 
1Kings
22:18  And the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl
said to Yehoshaphat, “Have I not said to you that he would not prophesy good
concerning me, but evil?” 
1Kings
22:19  Then he said, “Therefore hear the
word of יהוה : I saw יהוה
sitting on His throne, and all the host of the heavens standing by Him, on His
right and on His left. 
1Kings
22:20  “And יהוה
said, ‘Who shall entice Aḥaḇ to go up and fall at Ramoth Gil‛aḏ?’
And this one said this, and another said that. 
1Kings
22:21  “And a spirit came forward and
stood before יהוה, and said, ‘Let me entice him.’ 
1Kings
22:22  “And יהוה
said to him, ‘In what way?’ And he said, ‘I shall go out and be a spirit of
falsehood in the mouth of all his prophets.’ And He said, ‘Entice him, and also
prevail. Go out and do so.’ 
1Kings
22:23  “And now, see, יהוה
has put a spirit of falsehood in the mouth of all these prophets of yours, and יהוה
has spoken evil concerning you.” 
1Kings
22:24  And Tsiḏqiyahu son of Kena‛anah
came near and smote Miḵayehu on the cheek, and said, “Where did the
spirit of יהוה pass over from me to speak to you?” 
1Kings
22:25  And Miḵayehu said, “Look,
you shall see on that day when you go into an inner room to hide!” 
1Kings
22:26  And the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl
said, “Take Miḵayehu, and return him to Amon the governor of the city,
and to Yo’ash son of the sovereign, 
1Kings
22:27  and say, ‘Thus said the sovereign,
“Put this one in prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and water of
affliction until I come in peace.” ’ ” 
1Kings
22:28  And Miḵayehu said, “If you
ever return in peace, יהוה has not spoken by me.” And
he said, “Hear, all you people!” 
1Kings
22:29  And the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl
and Yehoshaphat the sovereign of Yehuḏah went up to Ramoth Gil‛aḏ.

1Kings
22:30  And the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl
said to Yehoshaphat, “Let me disguise myself and go into battle, but you put on
your robes.” So the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl disguised himself and went into
battle. 
1Kings
22:31  And the sovereign of Aram had
commanded the thirty-two commanders of his chariots, saying, “Fight with no one
small or great, but only with the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl.” 
1Kings
22:32  And it came to be, when the
commanders of the chariots saw Yehoshaphat, that they said, “Indeed, it is the
sovereign of Yisra’ĕl!” So they turned aside to fight against him, and
Yehoshaphat cried out. 
1Kings
22:33  And it came to be, when the
commanders of the chariots saw that it was not the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl,
that they turned back from pursuing him. 
1Kings
22:34  And a man drew a bow in his
simplicity, and smote the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl between the joints of his
armour. And he said to the driver of his chariot, “Turn around and take me out
of the battle, for I am wounded.” 
1Kings
22:35  And the battle increased that day.
And the sovereign was propped up in his chariot, facing the Arameans, and died
at evening, and the blood ran out from the wound onto the floor of the chariot.

1Kings
22:36  And as the sun was going down, a
shout passed through the camp, saying, “Each to his city, and each to his land!”

1Kings
22:37  So the sovereign died and was
brought to Shomeron, and they buried the sovereign in Shomeron. 
1Kings
22:38  And when the chariot was washed at
a pool in Shomeron, the dogs licked up his blood, where the whores bathed,
according to the word of יהוה which He had spoken. 
1Kings
22:39  And the rest of the acts of
Aḥaḇ and all that he did, and the ivory house which he built and
all the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the annals of
the sovereigns of Yisra’ĕl? 
1Kings
22:40  So Aḥaḇ slept with his
fathers, and Aḥazyahu his son reigned in his place. 
1Kings
22:41  And Yehoshaphat son of Asa began
to reign over Yehuḏah in the fourth year of Aḥaḇ sovereign of
Yisra’ĕl. 
1Kings
22:42  Yehoshaphat was thirty-five years
old when he became sovereign, and he reigned twenty-five years in Yerushalayim.
And his mother’s name was Azuḇah the daughter of Shilḥi. 
1Kings
22:43  And he walked in all the ways of
his father Asa. He did not turn aside from them, doing what was right in the
eyes of יהוה. Only, the high places were not taken
away, for the people slaughtered and burned incense on the high places. 
1Kings
22:44  And Yehoshaphat made peace with
the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl. 
1Kings
22:45  And the rest of the acts of
Yehoshaphat, and the might that he showed, and how he fought, are they not
written in the book of the annals of the sovereigns of Yehuḏah? 
1Kings
22:46  And the rest of the cult
prostitutes, who remained in the days of his father Asa, he cleared out from
the land. 
1Kings
22:47  And there was then no sovereign in
Eḏom, a deputy was sovereign. 
1Kings
22:48  Yehoshaphat made Tarshish ships to
go to Ophir for gold. However, they did not go, for the ships were wrecked at
Etsyon Geḇer. 
1Kings
22:49  Then Aḥazyahu son of
Aḥaḇ said to Yehoshaphat, “Let my servants go with your servants in
the ships.” But Yehoshaphat would not. 
1Kings
22:50  So Yehoshaphat slept with his
fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the City of Dawiḏ his father.
And Yehoram his son reigned in his place. 
1Kings
22:51  Aḥazyahu son of Aḥaḇ
began to reign over Yisra’ĕl in Shomeron in the seventeenth year of
Yehoshaphat sovereign of Yehuḏah, and reigned two years over Yisra’ĕl,

1Kings
22:52  and did evil in the eyes of יהוה,
and walked in the way of his father and in the way of his mother and in the way
of Yaroḇ‛am son of Neḇat, who had made Yisra’ĕl sin, 
1Kings
22:53  and served Ba‛al and bowed
himself to it, and provoked יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl,
according to all that his father had done.
