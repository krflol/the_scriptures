Tehillim/Psalms
Psalm
1:1  Blessed is the man who shall not
walk in the counsel of the wrong, And shall not stand in the path of sinners,
And shall not sit in the seat of scoffers,
Psalm
1:2  But his delight is in the Torah of יהוה,
And he meditates in His Torah day and night.
Psalm
1:3  For he shall be as a tree Planted by
the rivers of water, That yields its fruit in its season, And whose leaf does
not wither, And whatever he does prospers.
Psalm
1:4  The wrong are not so, But are like
the chaff which the wind blows away.
Psalm
1:5  Therefore the wrong shall not rise
in the judgment, Nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
Psalm
1:6  For יהוה
knows the way of the righteous, But the way of the wrong comes to naught.
Psalm
2:1  Why do the gentiles rage, And the
peoples meditate emptiness?
Psalm
2:2  The sovereigns of the earth take
their stand, And the rulers take counsel together, Against יהוה
and against His Messiah, and say,
Psalm
2:3  “Let us tear apart Their bonds, And
throw away Their ropes from us.”
Psalm
2:4  He who is sitting in the heavens
laughs, יהוה mocks at them.
Psalm
2:5  Then He speaks to them in His wrath,
And troubles them in His rage, saying,
Psalm
2:6  “But I, I have set My Sovereign on
Tsiyon, My set-apart mountain.”
Psalm
2:7  “I inscribe for a law: יהוה
has said to Me, ‘You are My Son, Today I have brought You forth.
Psalm
2:8  ‘Ask of Me, and I make the gentiles
Your inheritance, And the ends of the earth Your possession.
Psalm
2:9  ‘Break them with a rod of iron, Dash
them to pieces like a potter’s vessel.’ ”
Psalm
2:10  And now, be wise, O sovereigns; Be
instructed, you rulers of the earth.
Psalm
2:11  Serve יהוה
with fear, And rejoice with trembling.
Psalm
2:12  Kiss the Son, lest He be enraged,
And you perish in the way, For soon His wrath is to be kindled. Blessed are all
those taking refuge in Him.
Psalm
3:1  O יהוה, how
my adversaries have increased! Many rising up against me.
Psalm
3:2  Many are saying of me, “There is no
deliverance for him in Elohim.” Selah.
Psalm
3:3  But You, O יהוה,
are a shield for me, My esteem, and the One lifting up my head.
Psalm
3:4  I cried to יהוה
with my voice, And He heard me from His set-apart mountain. Selah.
Psalm
3:5  I, I laid down and slept; I awoke,
for יהוה sustained me.
Psalm
3:6  I am not afraid of ten thousands of
people Who have set themselves against me all around.
Psalm
3:7  Arise, O יהוה
; Save me, O my Elohim! Because You have smitten all my enemies on the cheek;
You have broken the teeth of the wrong.
Psalm
3:8  Deliverance belongs to יהוה.
Your blessing is on Your people. Selah.
Psalm
4:1  Answer me when I call, O Elohim of
my righteousness! You gave relief to me when I was in distress; Show favour to
me, and hear my prayer.
Psalm
4:2  Till when, O you sons of men, Would you
turn my esteem to shame, Would you love emptiness, seek falsehood? Selah.
Psalm
4:3  But know that יהוה
has separated a kind one for Himself; יהוה hears when I
call to Him.
Psalm
4:4  Tremble, and do not sin. Speak
within your heart on your bed, and be still. Selah.
Psalm
4:5  Offer slaughterings of
righteousness, And trust in יהוה.
Psalm
4:6  Many are saying, “Who would show us
good?” יהוה, lift up the light of Your face upon us.
Psalm
4:7  You have put more gladness in my
heart, Than in the season that their grain and wine increased.
Psalm
4:8  I lie down in peace altogether, and
sleep; For You alone, O יהוה, make me dwell in safety.
Psalm
5:1  Give ear to my words, O יהוה,
Consider my meditation.
Psalm
5:2  Attend to the voice of my cry, My
Sovereign and my Elohim, For unto You I pray.
Psalm
5:3  O יהוה, in
the morning You hear my voice; I present myself to You in the morning, And I
look up.
Psalm
5:4  For You are not an Ĕl taking
delight in wrong, Nor does evil dwell with You.
Psalm
5:5  The boasters do not stand before
Your eyes; You hate all workers of wickedness.
Psalm
5:6  You destroy those speaking
falsehood; יהוה loathes a man of blood and deceit.
Psalm
5:7  But I, I enter Your house In the
greatness of Your kindness; I bow myself toward Your set-apart Hĕḵal
in Your fear.
Psalm
5:8  O יהוה, lead
me in Your righteousness because of those watching me; Make Your way straight
before my face.
Psalm
5:9  For there is no stability in their
mouth; Their inward part is destruction; Their throat is an open grave; They
flatter with their tongue.
Psalm
5:10  Declare them guilty, O Elohim! Let
them fall by their own counsels; Thrust them away for their many
transgressions, Because they have rebelled against You.
Psalm
5:11  But let all who take refuge in You
rejoice; Let them ever shout for joy, because You shelter them; And let those
who love Your Name exult in You.
Psalm
5:12  For You bless the righteous, O יהוה
; You surround him with favour as with a shield.
Psalm
6:1  O יהוה, do
not rebuke me in Your displeasure, Nor discipline me in Your wrath.
Psalm
6:2  Show favour to me, O יהוה,
for I am fading away; O יהוה, heal me, for my bones
have been troubled.
Psalm
6:3  And my being has been greatly troubled;
And You, O יהוה – till when?
Psalm
6:4  Return, O יהוה,
rescue my life! Oh, save me for Your kindness’ sake!
Psalm
6:5  For in death there is no remembrance
of You; Who gives You thanks in the grave?
Psalm
6:6  I have grown weary with my groaning;
Every night I flood my bed; I drench my couch with my tears.
Psalm
6:7  My eye has grown dim because of
grief; It grows old because of all my adversaries.
Psalm
6:8  Depart from me, all you workers of
wickedness; For יהוה has heard the voice of my weeping.
Psalm
6:9  יהוה has
heard my pleading; יהוה receives my prayer.
Psalm
6:10  Let all my enemies be ashamed and
greatly troubled; They turn back suddenly, ashamed.
Psalm
7:1  O יהוה my
Elohim, in You I have taken refuge; Save me from all my pursuers; And deliver
me,
Psalm
7:2  Lest they tear at my throat like a
lion, Rending in pieces, with no one to deliver.
Psalm
7:3  O יהוה my
Elohim, if I have done this: If there is unrighteousness in my hands,
Psalm
7:4  If I have done evil to him who was
at peace with me, Or have plundered my enemy without cause,
Psalm
7:5  Let the enemy pursue me and overtake
my being, And trample my life to the ground, And lay my esteem in the dust.
Selah.
Psalm
7:6  Arise, O יהוה,
in Your displeasure; Lift Yourself up against the rage of my adversaries, And
awake for me! You shall command judgment!
Psalm
7:7  And let the congregation of the
peoples gather about You; And over them return on high.
Psalm
7:8  יהוה judges
the peoples; Judge me, O יהוה, according to my
righteousness, And according to my integrity within me.
Psalm
7:9  Please let the evil of the wrong be
ended, And establish the righteous; For the righteous Elohim is a trier of
hearts and kidneys.
Psalm
7:10  My shield is upon Elohim, Who saves
the upright in heart.
Psalm
7:11  Elohim is a righteous judge. And Ĕl
is enraged every day,
Psalm
7:12  If one does not repent! He sharpens
His sword, He bends His bow and makes it ready,
Psalm
7:13  And He has prepared for Himself
instruments of death, He makes His arrows hot for pursuers.
Psalm
7:14  See, he who is bound with
wickedness, And has conceived trouble and brought forth falsehood,
Psalm
7:15  He has made a pit and dug it out,
And falls into the ditch he made!
Psalm
7:16  His trouble turns back upon his own
head, And his wrongdoing comes down on the top of his head.
Psalm
7:17  I give thanks to יהוה
according to His righteousness, And praise the Name of יהוה
Most High.
Psalm
8:1  O יהוה, our
Master, how excellent is Your Name in all the earth, You who set Your splendour
above the heavens!
Psalm
8:2  Out of the mouth of babes and
infants You have founded strength, Because of Your adversaries, To put an end
to enemy and avenger.
Psalm
8:3  For I see Your heavens, the work of
Your fingers, The moon and the stars, which You have established.
Psalm
8:4  What is man that You remember him?
And the son of man that You visit him?
Psalm
8:5  Yet You have made him a little less
than Elohim, And have crowned him with esteem and splendour.
Psalm
8:6  You made him rule over the works of
Your hands; You have put all under his feet,
Psalm
8:7  All sheep and oxen, And also the
beasts of the field,
Psalm
8:8  The birds of the heavens, And the
fish of the sea, Passing through the paths of the seas.
Psalm
8:9  O יהוה, our
Master, How excellent is Your Name in all the earth!
Psalm
9:1  I praise You, O יהוה,
with all my heart; I declare all Your wonders.
Psalm
9:2  I rejoice and exult in You; I sing
praise to Your Name, O Most High.
Psalm
9:3  When my enemies turn back, They
stumble and perish before You.
Psalm
9:4  For You executed my right and my
cause, You sat on the throne judging in righteousness.
Psalm
9:5  You have rebuked the gentiles, You
have destroyed the wrong, You have wiped out their name forever and ever.
Psalm
9:6  The enemy is no more – ruins
everlasting! And You have uprooted the cities; Even their remembrance has
perished.
Psalm
9:7  But יהוה
abides forever, He is preparing His throne for judgment.
Psalm
9:8  And He judges the world in
righteousness, He judges the peoples in straightness.
Psalm
9:9  And יהוה is
a refuge for the crushed one, A refuge in times of distress.
Psalm
9:10  And those who know Your Name trust
in You, For You have not forsaken those who seek You, O יהוה.
Psalm
9:11  Sing praises to יהוה,
who dwells in Tsiyon! Declare His deeds among the peoples.
Psalm
9:12  For He remembers the seekers of
bloodshed, He does not forget the cry of the afflicted.
Psalm
9:13  Show favour to me, O יהוה
! See my affliction by those who hate me, You who lift me up from the gates of
death,
Psalm
9:14  So that I declare all Your praise
In the gates of the daughter of Tsiyon. I rejoice in Your deliverance.
Psalm
9:15  The gentiles have sunk down in the
pit which they made; In the net which they hid, their own foot is caught.
Psalm
9:16  יהוה has
made Himself known, He has done right-ruling; The wrong is snared in the work
of his own hands. Meditation. Selah.
Psalm
9:17  The wrong return to the grave, All
the gentiles that forget Elohim.
Psalm
9:18  For the needy is not always
forgotten; Neither the expectancy of the poor lost forever.
Psalm
9:19  Arise, O יהוה,
Do not let man prevail; Let the gentiles be judged before Your face.
Psalm
9:20  Put them in fear, O יהוה,
Let the gentiles know they are but
men. Selah.
Psalm
10:1  Why do You stand afar off, O יהוה,
hiding in times of distress? 
Psalm
10:2  In arrogance the wrongdoer hotly
pursues the poor; They are caught by the schemes which they devised.
Psalm
10:3  For the wrongdoer boasted of his
cravings; And the greedy one cursed and despised יהוה.
Psalm
10:4  In the pride of his face The
wrongdoer does not seek Him, In all
his thoughts there is no Elohim!
Psalm
10:5  His ways are always prosperous!
Your right-rulings are on high, out of his sight! He snorts at all his
adversaries!
Psalm
10:6  He has said in his heart, “I shall
not be moved; From generation to generation, never be in evil!”
Psalm
10:7  His mouth is filled with cursing
and deceit and oppression; Under his tongue is trouble and wickedness.
Psalm
10:8  He sits in the hiding places of the
villages; In the secret places he murders the innocent; His eyes are on the
lookout for the helpless.
Psalm
10:9  He lies in wait in a secret place,
as a lion in his den; He lies in wait to catch the poor; He catches the poor,
drawing him into his net.
Psalm
10:10  And he crouches, he lies low, And
the helpless fall under his strength.
Psalm
10:11  He has said in his heart, “Ĕl
has forgotten, He has hidden His face, He shall never see.”
Psalm
10:12  Arise, O יהוה
! O Ĕl, lift up Your hand! Do not forget the lowly ones.
Psalm
10:13  Why do the wrong scorn Elohim? He
has said in his heart, “It is not required.”
Psalm
10:14  You have seen it, for You observe
trouble and grief, To repay with Your hand. The poor commits himself to You;
You are the helper of the fatherless.
Psalm
10:15  Break the arm of the wrong one and
the evil one; Search out his wrongness that would not be found out.
Psalm
10:16  יהוה is
Sovereign forever and ever; The gentiles shall perish from His land.
Psalm
10:17  יהוה, You
have heard the desire of the lowly ones; You prepare their heart; You incline
Your ear,
Psalm
10:18  To defend the fatherless and the
downtrodden; So that man who is of the earth no longer oppresses!
Psalm
11:1  In יהוה I
have taken refuge; Why do you say to me, “Flee to your mountain like a bird”?
Psalm
11:2  For look! The wrong bend a bow,
They set their arrow on the string, To shoot in darkness at the upright in
heart.
Psalm
11:3  When the foundations are destroyed,
What shall the righteous do?
Psalm
11:4  יהוה is in
His set-apart Hĕḵal, The throne of יהוה is
in the heavens. His eyes see, His eyelids examine the sons of men.
Psalm
11:5  יהוה tries
the righteous, But His being shall hate the wrong And the one who loves
violence.
Psalm
11:6  Upon the wrong He rains snares,
Fire and sulphur and a scorching wind Are the portion of their cup.
Psalm
11:7  For יהוה is
righteous, He has loved righteousness; The upright shall see His face.
Psalm
12:1  Save, יהוה,
for the kind one is no more! For the trustworthy have ceased from among the
sons of men.
Psalm
12:2  They speak falsehood with each
other; They speak with flattering
lips, a double heart.
Psalm
12:3  יהוה does
cut off all flattering lips, A tongue that speaks swelling words,
Psalm
12:4  Who have said, “With our tongue we
do mightily; Our lips are our own; Who is master over us?”
Psalm
12:5  “Because of the oppression of the
poor, because of the sighing of the needy, I now arise,” says יהוה,
“I set in safety – he pants for it.”
Psalm
12:6  The Words of יהוה
are clean Words, Silver tried in a furnace of earth, Refined seven times.
Psalm
12:7  You guard them, O יהוה,
You preserve them from this generation forever.
Psalm
12:8  The wrong walk around on every
side, When worthlessness is exalted among the sons of men.
Psalm
13:1  How long would You forget me, O יהוה
? Forever? How long would You hide Your face from me?
Psalm
13:2  How long would I take counsel in my
being, Grief in my heart day by day? How long would my enemy be exalted over
me?
Psalm
13:3  Look! Answer me, O יהוה
my Elohim; Enlighten my eyes, Lest I sleep in death;
Psalm
13:4  Lest my enemy say, “I have
prevailed against him,” Lest my
adversaries rejoice when I am moved.
Psalm
13:5  But I have trusted in Your
kindness; My heart rejoices in Your deliverance.
Psalm
13:6  I sing to יהוה,
Because He has been good to me.
Psalm
14:1  The fool has said in his heart, “There
is no יהוה.” They have done corruptly, They have done
an abominable deed, There is no one who does good.
Psalm
14:2  יהוה looked
down from the heavens on the sons of mankind, To see if there is a wise one,
seeking יהוה.
Psalm
14:3  They have all turned aside, They
have together become filthy; No one is doing good, not even one.
Psalm
14:4  Have all the workers of wickedness
no knowledge, Who eat up my people as they eat bread, And do not call on יהוה
?
Psalm
14:5  There they are in great fear, For יהוה
is with the generation of the righteous.
Psalm
14:6  You would put to shame the counsel
of the poor, But יהוה is his refuge.
Psalm
14:7  O that the deliverance of Yisra’ĕl
Would be given out of Tsiyon! When יהוה turns back the
captivity of His people, Let Ya‛aqoḇ rejoice, let Yisra’ĕl be
glad.
Psalm
15:1  יהוה, who
does sojourn in Your Tent? Who does dwell in Your set-apart mountain?
Psalm
15:2  He who walks blamelessly, And does
righteousness, And speaks the truth in his heart.
Psalm
15:3  He has not slandered with his
tongue, He has not done evil to his neighbour, Nor lifted up a reproach against
his friend;
Psalm
15:4  In whose eyes a reprobate one is
despised, But he esteems those who fear יהוה ; He who
swears to his own hurt and does not change;
Psalm
15:5  He has not put out his silver at
interest, And has not taken a bribe against the innocent. He who does these is
never moved.
Psalm
16:1  Guard me, O Ĕl, for I have
taken refuge in You. 
Psalm
16:2  I have said to יהוה,
“You are יהוה, I have no good beside You.”
Psalm
16:3  As for the set-apart ones who are
on the earth, They are the excellent ones, in whom is all my delight.
Psalm
16:4  The sorrows of those who run after
another one are increased; I would not pour out their drink offerings of blood,
Nor take up their names on my lips.
Psalm
16:5  יהוה is the
portion of my inheritance and my cup; You uphold my lot.
Psalm
16:6  Boundary
lines have fallen to me in pleasant places; Indeed, a good inheritance is mine.
Psalm
16:7  I bless יהוה
who has given me counsel; My kidneys also instruct me in the nights.
Psalm
16:8  I have set יהוה
always before me; Because He is at my
right hand I am not shaken.
Psalm
16:9  Therefore my heart was glad, and my
esteem rejoices; My flesh also dwells in safety.
Psalm
16:10  For You do not leave my being in
the grave, Neither let Your Kind One see corruption.
Psalm
16:11  You show me the path of life; In
Your presence is joy to satisfaction; At Your right hand are pleasures forever.
Psalm
17:1  Hear righteousness, יהוה,
Listen to my cry; Give ear to my prayer, From lips without deceit.
Psalm
17:2  Let my right-ruling go out from
Your presence; Let Your eyes see what is straight.
Psalm
17:3  You have examined my heart; You
have visited me in the night; You have tried me – You find I have not schemed;
My mouth would not transgress.
Psalm
17:4  As for the deeds of men – By the
word of Your lips, I have kept myself from the paths of the destroyer.
Psalm
17:5  My steps have held fast to Your
paths, My feet have not slipped.
Psalm
17:6  I have called upon You, for You
answer me, O Ĕl; Incline Your ear to me, hear my speech.
Psalm
17:7  Let Your kindness be distinguished,
You who save by Your right hand those who take refuge From those who rise up.
Psalm
17:8  Guard me as the apple of Your eye.
Hide me under the shadow of Your wings,
Psalm
17:9  From the face of the wrong who
ravage me, From my deadly enemies who surround me.
Psalm
17:10  They are enclosed in their own
fat, They speak proudly with their mouths,
Psalm
17:11  They have now surrounded us in our
steps, They set their eyes to cast us
to the ground,
Psalm
17:12  Like a lion who is eager to tear
his prey, And as a young lion crouching in cover.
Psalm
17:13  Arise, O יהוה,
Confront him, cause him to bend; Deliver my being from the wrong by Your sword,
Psalm
17:14  From men by Your hand, O יהוה,
From men of the world whose portion is in this
life, And You fill their bellies with Your treasure, They are satisfied with
children, And shall leave their riches to their babes.
Psalm
17:15  As for me, let Me see Your face in
righteousness; I am satisfied to see
Your appearance when I awake.
Psalm
18:1  I love You, O יהוה,
My strength.
Psalm
18:2  יהוה is my
rock and my stronghold and my deliverer; My Ĕl is my rock, I take refuge
in Him; My shield and the horn of my deliverance, my high tower.
Psalm
18:3  I call upon יהוה,
the One to be praised, And I am saved from my enemies.
Psalm
18:4  The cords of death surrounded me,
And the floods of Beliya‛al made me afraid.
Psalm
18:5  The cords of the grave were all
around me; The snares of death were before me.
Psalm
18:6  In my distress I called upon יהוה,
And to my Elohim I cried; He heard my voice from His Hĕḵal, And my
cry went before Him, into His ears.
Psalm
18:7  And the earth shook and trembled;
Even the foundations of the mountains were troubled And they shook, because He
was wroth.
Psalm
18:8  Smoke went up from His nostrils,
And consuming fire from His mouth; Coals were kindled by it.
Psalm
18:9  And He bowed the heavens and came down,
And thick darkness was under His feet.
Psalm
18:10  And He rode upon a keruḇ,
and flew; He flew upon the wings of the wind.
Psalm
18:11  He made darkness His covering;
Around Him His booth, Darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies.
Psalm
18:12  From the brightness before Him,
His thick clouds passed, hail and coals of fire.
Psalm
18:13  And יהוה
thundered in the heavens, And the Most High sent forth His voice, Hail and
coals of fire.
Psalm
18:14  And He sent out His arrows and
scattered them, And much lightning, and confused them.
Psalm
18:15  And the channels of waters were
seen, And the foundations of the world were uncovered At Your rebuke, O יהוה,
At the blast of the breath of Your nostrils.
Psalm
18:16  He sent from above, He took me; He
drew me out of many waters.
Psalm
18:17  He delivered me from my strong
enemy, And from those hating me, For they were stronger than I.
Psalm
18:18  They confronted me in the day of
my calamity, But יהוה was my support.
Psalm
18:19  And He brought me out into a large
place; He delivered me for He delighted in me.
Psalm
18:20  יהוה
rewarded me according to my righteousness; According to the cleanness of my
hands He repaid me.
Psalm
18:21  For I have guarded the ways of יהוה,
And have not acted wrongly against my Elohim.
Psalm
18:22  For all His right-rulings are
before me, And I did not turn from His laws.
Psalm
18:23  And I am perfect before Him, And I
guard myself from my crookedness.
Psalm
18:24  And יהוה
repays me according to my righteousness, According to the cleanness of my hands
before His eyes.
Psalm
18:25  With the kind You show Yourself
kind; With the perfect one You show Yourself perfect;
Psalm
18:26  With the clean You show Yourself
clean; And with the crooked You show Yourself twisted.
Psalm
18:27  For You save the afflicted people,
But bring down those whose eyes are haughty.
Psalm
18:28  For You Yourself light my lamp; יהוה
my Elohim makes my darkness light.
Psalm
18:29  For with You I run against a band,
And with my Elohim I leap over a wall.
Psalm
18:30  The Ĕl – His way is perfect;
The Word of יהוה is proven; He is a shield to all who
take refuge in Him.
Psalm
18:31  For who is Eloah, besides יהוה
? And who is a rock, except our Elohim?
Psalm
18:32  It is Ĕl who girds me with
strength, And makes my way perfect,
Psalm
18:33  Making my feet like the feet of
deer, And sets me on my high places,
Psalm
18:34  Teaching my hands for battle, So
that my arms shall bend a bow of bronze.
Psalm
18:35  And You give me the shield of Your
deliverance; And Your right hand supports me, And Your lowliness makes me
great.
Psalm
18:36  You enlarge my step under me; And
my feet shall not slip.
Psalm
18:37  I pursue my enemies and overtake
them; And do not turn back till they are destroyed.
Psalm
18:38  I crush them, and they are unable
to rise; They fall under my feet.
Psalm
18:39  And You gird me with strength for
battle; Cause my adversaries to bow under me.
Psalm
18:40  And You have made my enemies turn
their backs, As for those hating me, I cut them off.
Psalm
18:41  They cry – but no one is there to
save, To יהוה – but He answers them not.
Psalm
18:42  And I beat them as dust before the
wind; I empty them out like dirt in the streets.
Psalm
18:43  You deliver me from the strivings
of the people, You set me at the head of the nations; A people I have not known
serve me.
Psalm
18:44  As soon as they hear of me they
obey me; The foreigners submit to me.
Psalm
18:45  The foreigners fade away, And come
frightened from their strongholds.
Psalm
18:46  יהוה
lives! And blessed is my Rock! And exalted is the Elohim of my deliverance,
Psalm
18:47  The Ĕl who avenges me, And He
humbles the peoples under me;
Psalm
18:48  My deliverer from my enemies. You
lift me up above those who rise against me; You deliver me from a man of violence.
Psalm
18:49  Therefore I give thanks to You, O יהוה,
among nations, And I sing praise to Your Name,
Psalm
18:50  Making great the deliverance of
His sovereign, And showing kindness to His anointed, To Dawiḏ and his
seed, forever.
Psalm
19:1  The heavens are proclaiming the
esteem of Ĕl; And the expanse is declaring the work of His hand.
Psalm
19:2  Day to day pours forth speech, And
night to night reveals knowledge.
Psalm
19:3  There is no speech, and there are
no words, Their voice is not heard.
Psalm
19:4  Their line has gone out through all
the earth, And their words to the end of the world. In them He set up a tent
for the sun,
Psalm
19:5  And it is like a bridegroom coming
out of his room, It rejoices like a strong man to run the path.
Psalm
19:6  Its rising is from one end of the
heavens, And its circuit to the other end; And naught is hidden from its heat.
Psalm
19:7  The Torah of יהוה
is perfect, bringing back the being; The witness of יהוה
is trustworthy, making wise the simple;
Psalm
19:8  The orders of יהוה
are straight, rejoicing the heart; The command of יהוה
is clear, enlightening the eyes;
Psalm
19:9  The fear of יהוה
is clean, standing forever; The right-rulings of יהוה
are true, They are righteous altogether,
Psalm
19:10  More desirable than gold, Than
much fine gold; And sweeter than honey and the honeycomb.
Psalm
19:11  Also, Your servant is warned by
them, In guarding them there is great reward.
Psalm
19:12  Who discerns mistakes? Declare me
innocent from those that are secret,
Psalm
19:13  Also keep Your servant back from
presumptuous ones, Do not let them rule over me. Then shall I be perfect, and
innocent of great transgression.
Psalm
19:14  Let the words of my mouth and the
meditation of my heart Be pleasing before You, O יהוה, my
rock and my redeemer.
Psalm
20:1  יהוה does
answer you in the day of distress! The Name of the Elohim of Ya‛aqoḇ
does set you on high!
Psalm
20:2  He does send you help from the
set-apart place, And does uphold you from Tsiyon!
Psalm
20:3  He does remember all your
offerings, And does accept your burnt offering! Selah.
Psalm
20:4  He does give you according to your
heart, And fills all your plans!
Psalm
20:5  We sing of Your deliverance, And in
the Name of our Elohim we set up a banner! יהוה does
fill all your requests!
Psalm
20:6  Now I know that יהוה
shall save His Anointed; He answers him from His set-apart heavens With the
saving might of His right hand.
Psalm
20:7  Some trust in chariots, and some in horses, But we remember the Name of יהוה
our Elohim.
Psalm
20:8  They, they have bowed down and
fallen; But we have risen and are established.
Psalm
20:9  Save, יהוה
! Let the Sovereign answer us in the day we call.
Psalm
21:1  The sovereign rejoices in Your
strength, O יהוה ; And how greatly he exults in Your
deliverance!
Psalm
21:2  You have given him the desire of
his heart, And You have not withheld the request of his lips. Selah.
Psalm
21:3  For You put before him the
blessings of goodness; You set a crown of fine gold on his head.
Psalm
21:4  He asked life from You, and You
gave it to him – Length of days forever and ever.
Psalm
21:5  Through Your deliverance his esteem
is great; You have laid excellency and splendour on him.
Psalm
21:6  For You have made him most blessed
forever; You have made him glad with the joy of Your presence.
Psalm
21:7  For the sovereign is trusting in יהוה,
And through the kindness of the Most High he is not moved.
Psalm
21:8  Your hand reaches all Your enemies;
Your right hand reaches those who hate You.
Psalm
21:9  You make them as a furnace of fire
in the time of Your presence; יהוה does swallow them up
in His wrath, And fire does consume them.
Psalm
21:10  You destroy their fruit from the
earth, And their seed from among the sons of men.
Psalm
21:11  For they held out evil against
You; They devised a plot; they do not prevail.
Psalm
21:12  For You make them turn their back,
When You aim with Your bowstring toward their faces.
Psalm
21:13  Be exalted, O יהוה,
in Your strength! We sing and we praise Your might.
Psalm
22:1  My Ĕl, My Ĕl, why have
You forsaken Me – Far from saving Me,
far from the words of My groaning?
Psalm
22:2  O My Elohim, I call by day, but You
do not answer; And by night, but I find no rest.
Psalm
22:3  Yet You are set-apart, Enthroned on
the praises of Yisra’ĕl.
Psalm
22:4  Our fathers trusted in You; They
trusted, and You delivered them.
Psalm
22:5  They cried to You, and were
delivered; They trusted in You, and were not ashamed.
Psalm
22:6  But I am a worm, and no man; A
reproach of men, and despised by the people.
Psalm
22:7  All those who see Me mock Me; They
shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying,
Psalm
22:8  “He trusted in יהוה,
let Him rescue Him; Let Him deliver Him, seeing He has delighted in Him!”
Psalm
22:9  For You are the One who took Me out
of the womb; Causing Me to trust while
on My mother’s breasts.
Psalm
22:10  I was cast upon You from birth.
From My mother’s belly You have been My Ĕl.
Psalm
22:11  Do not be far from Me, For
distress is near; For there is none to help.
Psalm
22:12  Many bulls have surrounded Me;
Strong ones of Bashan have encircled Me.
Psalm
22:13  They have opened their mouths
against Me, As a raging and roaring lion.
Psalm
22:14  I have been poured out like water,
And all My bones have been spread apart; My heart has become like wax; It has
melted in the midst of My inward parts.
Psalm
22:15  My strength is dried like a
potsherd, And My tongue is cleaving to My jaws; And to the dust of death You
are appointing Me.
Psalm
22:16  For dogs have surrounded Me; A
crowd of evil ones have encircled Me, Piercing My hands and My feet;
Psalm
22:17  I count all My bones. They look,
they stare at Me.
Psalm
22:18  They divide My garments among
them, And for My raiment they cast lots.
Psalm
22:19  But You, O יהוה,
do not be far off; O My Strength, hasten to help Me!
Psalm
22:20  Deliver My life from the sword, My
only life from the power of the dog.
Psalm
22:21  Save Me from the mouth of the
lion, And from the horns of the wild beasts! You have answered Me.
Psalm
22:22  I make known Your Name to My
brothers; In the midst of the assembly I praise You.
Psalm
22:23  You who fear יהוה,
praise Him! All you seed of Ya‛aqoḇ, esteem Him, And fear Him, all
you seed of Yisra’ĕl!
Psalm
22:24  For He has not despised Nor hated the
affliction of the afflicted; Nor has He hidden His face from Him; But when He
cried to Him, He heard.
Psalm
22:25  From You is My praise in the great
assembly; I pay My vows before those who fear Him.
Psalm
22:26  The meek ones do eat and are
satisfied; Let those who seek Him praise יהוה. Let your
heart live forever!
Psalm
22:27  Let all the ends of the earth
Remember and turn to יהוה, And all clans of the nations
Bow themselves before You.
Psalm
22:28  For the reign belongs to יהוה,
And He is ruling over the nations.
Psalm
22:29  All the fat ones of the earth
Shall eat and bow themselves; All who go down to the dust bow before Him, Even
he who did not keep alive his own life.
Psalm
22:30  A seed shall serve Him. It is declared
of יהוה to the coming
generation.
Psalm
22:31  They shall come and declare His
righteousness To a people yet to be
born, For He shall do it!
Psalm
23:1  יהוה is my
shepherd; I do not lack.
Psalm
23:2  He makes me to lie down in green
pastures; He leads me beside still waters.
Psalm
23:3  He turns back my being; He leads me
in paths of righteousness For His Name’s sake.
Psalm
23:4  When I walk through the valley of
the shadow of death, I fear no evil. For You are with me; Your rod and Your
staff, they comfort me.
Psalm
23:5  You spread before me a table in the
face of my enemies; You have anointed my head with oil; My cup runs over.
Psalm
23:6  Only goodness and kindness follow
me All the days of my life; And I shall dwell in the House of יהוה,
To the length of days!
Psalm
24:1  The earth belongs to יהוה,
And all that fills it – The world and those who dwell in it.
Psalm
24:2  For He has founded it upon the
seas, And upon the waters He does establish it.
Psalm
24:3  Who does go up into the mountain of
יהוה ? And who does stand in His set-apart place?
Psalm
24:4  He who has innocent hands and a
clean heart, Who did not bring his life to naught, And did not swear
deceivingly.
Psalm
24:5  He receives a blessing from יהוה,
And righteousness from the Elohim of his deliverance.
Psalm
24:6  This is the generation of those who
seek Him; Ya‛aqoḇ, who seek Your face. Selah.
Psalm
24:7  Lift up your heads, O you gates!
And be lifted up, you everlasting doors! And let the Sovereign of esteem come
in.
Psalm
24:8  Who is this Sovereign of esteem? יהוה
strong and mighty, יהוה mighty in battle.
Psalm
24:9  Lift up your heads, O you gates!
Even lift up, you everlasting doors! And let the Sovereign of esteem come in.
Psalm
24:10  Who is this Sovereign of esteem? יהוה
of hosts, He is the Sovereign of esteem! Selah.
Psalm
25:1  To You, O יהוה,
I lift up my being.
Psalm
25:2  O my Elohim, in You I have put my
trust; Let me not be ashamed; Let not my enemies exult over me.
Psalm
25:3  Indeed, let no one who waits on You
be ashamed; Let those who are treacherous without cause be ashamed.
Psalm
25:4  Show me Your ways, O יהוה
; Teach me Your paths.
Psalm
25:5  Lead me in Your truth and teach me,
For You are the Elohim of my deliverance; On You I wait all the day.
Psalm
25:6  Remember, O יהוה,
Your compassion and Your kindnesses, For they are from everlasting.
Psalm
25:7  Do not remember the sins of my
youth, and my transgressions; According to Your kindness remember me, For Your
goodness’ sake, O יהוה.
Psalm
25:8  Good and straight is יהוה
; Therefore He teaches sinners in the way.
Psalm
25:9  He guides the meek ones in
right-ruling, And He teaches the meek ones His way.
Psalm
25:10  All the paths of יהוה
are kindness and truth, To those who guard His covenant and His witnesses.
Psalm
25:11  For Your Name’s sake, O יהוה,
You shall pardon my crookedness, though it is great.
Psalm
25:12  Who, then, is the man that fears יהוה
? He teaches him in the way he should choose.
Psalm
25:13  His life dwells in good, And his
seed inherits the earth.
Psalm
25:14  The secret of יהוה
is with those who fear Him, And He makes His covenant known to them.
Psalm
25:15  My eyes are ever toward יהוה,
For He brings my feet out of the net.
Psalm
25:16  Turn Your face to me, and show me
favour, For I am lonely and afflicted.
Psalm
25:17  The distresses of my heart have
enlarged; Oh, bring me out of my distresses!
Psalm
25:18  Look on my affliction and my toil,
And forgive all my sins.
Psalm
25:19  See how many my enemies have
become; And they hate me with a violent hatred.
Psalm
25:20  Oh, guard my life, and deliver me;
Let me not be ashamed, for I have taken refuge in You.
Psalm
25:21  Let integrity and straightness
guard me, For I have waited for You.
Psalm
25:22  Redeem Yisra’ĕl, O Elohim,
Out of all his distresses!
Psalm
26:1  Rule me rightly, O יהוה,
For I have walked in my integrity. And I have trusted in יהוה,
without wavering.
Psalm
26:2  Examine me, O יהוה,
and prove me; Try my kidneys and my heart.
Psalm
26:3  For Your kindness is before my
eyes, And I have walked in Your truth.
Psalm
26:4  I have not sat with men of
falsehood, Nor do I enter with pretenders.
Psalm
26:5  I have hated the assembly of
evil-doers, And I do not sit with the wrong.
Psalm
26:6  I wash my hands in innocence; And I
walk around Your altar, O יהוה,
Psalm
26:7  To raise a voice of thanksgiving,
And to declare all Your wonders.
Psalm
26:8  יהוה, I
have loved the abode of Your house, And the place where Your esteem dwells.
Psalm
26:9  Do not gather my being together
with sinners, Nor my life with bloodthirsty men,
Psalm
26:10  In whose hands is a plot, And
their right hand is filled with bribes.
Psalm
26:11  But as for me, I walk in my
integrity; Redeem me and show me favour.
Psalm
26:12  My foot shall stand on a level place;
In the assemblies I bless יהוה.
Psalm
27:1  יהוה is my
light and my deliverance; Whom should I fear? יהוה is
the refuge of my life; Whom should I dread?
Psalm
27:2  When evil-doers come against me To
eat up my flesh, My adversaries and my enemies, They shall stumble and fall.
Psalm
27:3  Though an army encamps against me,
My heart does not fear; Though battle comes up against me, Even then I would be
trusting.
Psalm
27:4  One matter I asked of יהוה – this I seek: To
dwell in the House of יהוה All the days of my life, To
see the pleasantness of יהוה, And to inquire in His Hĕḵal.
Psalm
27:5  For in the day of evil He hides me
in His booth; In the covering of His Tent He hides me; On a rock He raises me
up.
Psalm
27:6  And now my head is lifted up above
my enemies all around me; And I offer in His Tent with shouts of joy; I sing,
yea, I sing praises to יהוה.
Psalm
27:7  Hear, O יהוה,
when I cry with my voice! And show me favour, and answer me.
Psalm
27:8  To my heart You have said, “Seek My
face.” Your face, יהוה, I seek.
Psalm
27:9  Do not hide Your face from me; Do
not turn Your servant away in displeasure; You have been my help; Do not leave
me nor forsake me, O Elohim of my deliverance.
Psalm
27:10  When my father and my mother have
forsaken me, Then יהוה does take me in.
Psalm
27:11  Teach me Your way, O יהוה,
And lead me in a smooth path, because of my enemies.
Psalm
27:12  Do not give me over To the desire
of my adversaries; For false witnesses have risen against me, And they breathe
out cruelty to me.
Psalm
27:13  What if I had not believed To see
the goodness of יהוה In the land of the living!
Psalm
27:14  Wait on יהוה,
be strong, And let Him strengthen your heart! Wait, I say, on יהוה
!
Psalm
28:1  I cry to You, O יהוה
my Rock: Do not be deaf to me! For if You are silent to me, I shall be like
those who go down to the pit.
Psalm
28:2  Hear the voice of my prayers when I
cry to You, When I lift up my hands Toward Your Set-apart Speaking Place.
Psalm
28:3  Do not draw me away with the wrong
And with the workers of wickedness, Who speak peace to their neighbours, But
evil is in their hearts.
Psalm
28:4  Give to them according to their
deeds, And according to the evil of their practices; Give to them according to
the work of their hands; Bring back to them what they deserve.
Psalm
28:5  Because they do not heed the works
of יהוה, Nor the works of His hands, He throws them
down, And does not build them up.
Psalm
28:6  Blessed be יהוה,
Because He has heard the voice of my prayers!
Psalm
28:7  יהוה is my
strength, and my shield; My heart has trusted in Him, and I have been helped;
Therefore my heart exults, And with my song I thank Him.
Psalm
28:8  יהוה is the
strength of His people, And He is the stronghold of deliverance of His
anointed.
Psalm
28:9  Save Your people, and bless Your
inheritance; And be their Shepherd, and bear them up forever.
Psalm
29:1  Ascribe to יהוה,
O you sons of the mighty, Ascribe to יהוה esteem and
strength.
Psalm
29:2  Ascribe to יהוה
the esteem of His Name; Bow yourselves to יהוה in the
splendour of set-apartness.
Psalm
29:3  The voice of יהוה
is over the waters; The Ĕl of esteem thunders; יהוה
is over many waters.
Psalm
29:4  The voice of יהוה
is with power, The voice of יהוה is with greatness.
Psalm
29:5  The voice of יהוה
is breaking the cedars, יהוה is breaking the cedars of
Leḇanon in pieces.
Psalm
29:6  And He makes them skip like a calf,
Leḇanon and Siryon like a young wild ox.
Psalm
29:7  The voice of יהוה
cuts through the flames of fire. 
Psalm
29:8  The voice of יהוה
shakes the wilderness; יהוה shakes the Wilderness of Qaḏĕsh.
Psalm
29:9  The voice of יהוה
makes the deer give birth, And strips the forests bare; And in His Hĕḵal
everyone says, “Esteem!”
Psalm
29:10  יהוה sat
enthroned at the Flood, And יהוה sits as Sovereign
forever.
Psalm
29:11  יהוה gives
strength to His people; יהוה blesses His people with
peace.
Psalm
30:1  I exalt You, O יהוה,
for You have drawn me up, And have not let my enemies rejoice over me.
Psalm
30:2  יהוה my
Elohim, I have cried to You, And You have healed me.
Psalm
30:3  יהוה, You
brought me up from the grave; You have kept me alive, from going down into the
pit.
Psalm
30:4  Sing praise to יהוה,
You kind ones of His, And give thanks at the remembrance of His Set-apartness.
Psalm
30:5  For His displeasure is for a
moment, His delight is for life; Weeping might last for the night, But joy
comes in the morning.
Psalm
30:6  As for me, I have said in my ease, “Never
would I be shaken!” 
Psalm
30:7  יהוה, in
Your good pleasure You have made my mountain to stand strong; You hid Your
face, and I was troubled.
Psalm
30:8  I cried out to You, O יהוה
; And to יהוה I prayed:
Psalm
30:9  “What gain is there in my blood,
When I go down to the pit? Would dust praise You? Would it declare Your truth?
Psalm
30:10  “Hear, O יהוה,
and show me favour; יהוה, be my helper!” 
Psalm
30:11  You have turned my mourning into
dancing for me; You have torn off my sackcloth and girded me with gladness,
Psalm
30:12  So that esteem might praise You
and not be silent. O יהוה my Elohim, I thank You
forever.
Psalm
31:1  In You, O יהוה,
I have taken refuge; Let me never be ashamed; Deliver me in Your righteousness.
Psalm
31:2  Incline Your ear to me, Deliver me
speedily; Be a rock of refuge to me, A house of defence to save me.
Psalm
31:3  For You are my rock and my
stronghold; For Your Name’s sake lead me and guide me.
Psalm
31:4  Bring me out of the net which they
have hidden for me, For You are my stronghold.
Psalm
31:5  Into Your hand I commit my spirit;
You have redeemed me, O יהוה Ĕl of truth.
Psalm
31:6  I have hated those who observe
lying vanities; But I trust in יהוה.
Psalm
31:7  I exult and rejoice in Your
kindness, For You have seen my affliction; You have known the distresses of my
life,
Psalm
31:8  And You have not shut me up into
the hand of the enemy. You have set my feet in a large place.
Psalm
31:9  Show me favour, O יהוה,
for I am in distress; My eye, my being and my body have become old with grief!
Psalm
31:10  For my life is consumed in sorrow,
And my years in sighing; My strength fails because of my crookedness, And my
bones have become old.
Psalm
31:11  I am a reproach among all my
adversaries, But most of all among my neighbours, And a dread to my friends;
Those who see me outside flee from me.
Psalm
31:12  I have been forgotten like someone
dead from the heart; I have been like a missing vessel.
Psalm
31:13  For I hear the evil report of
many; Fear is from all around; When they take counsel together against me, They
plot to take away my life.
Psalm
31:14  But I, I have put my trust in You,
O יהוה ; I have said, “You are my Elohim.”
Psalm
31:15  My times are in Your hand; Deliver
me from the hand of my enemies, And from those who pursue me.
Psalm
31:16  Make Your face shine upon Your
servant; Save me in Your kindness.
Psalm
31:17  Do not let me be ashamed, O יהוה,
For I have called upon You; Let the wrong be ashamed; Let them be silenced in
the grave.
Psalm
31:18  Let lips of falsehood be stilled,
Which speak recklessly against the righteous, With pride and scorn.
Psalm
31:19  How great is Your goodness, Which
You have laid up for those fearing You, Which You have prepared for those
taking refuge in You In the sight of the sons of men!
Psalm
31:20  In the secrecy of Your presence
You shall hide them from the plots of man; You shelter them in a booth from the
strife of tongues.
Psalm
31:21  Blessed be יהוה,
For He has made marvellous His kindness to me in a strong city!
Psalm
31:22  And I, I have said in my haste, “I
am cut off from before Your eyes,” Yet You heard the voice of my prayers When I
cried out to You.
Psalm
31:23  Love יהוה,
all you His kind ones! For יהוה guards the trustworthy
ones, And exceedingly repays the doer of pride.
Psalm
31:24  Be strong, and let Him strengthen
your heart, All you who are waiting for יהוה.
Psalm
32:1  Blessed is he whose transgression
is forgiven, Whose sin is covered.
Psalm
32:2  Blessed is the man to whom יהוה
imputes no crookedness, And in whose spirit there is no deceit.
Psalm
32:3  When I kept silent, my bones became
old Through my groaning all the day.
Psalm
32:4  For day and night Your hand was
heavy upon me; My sap was turned into the droughts of summer. Selah.
Psalm
32:5  I acknowledged my sin to You, And
my crookedness I did not hide. I have said, “I confess my transgressions to יהוה,”
And You forgave the crookedness of my sin. Selah.
Psalm
32:6  Therefore, let every kind one pray
to You While You might be found; Even
in a flood of great waters They would not reach him.
Psalm
32:7  You are my hiding place; You
preserve me from distress; You surround me with songs of deliverance. Selah.
Psalm
32:8  “Let Me instruct you and teach you
in the way you should go; Let Me counsel, My eye be on you.
Psalm
32:9  Do not be like the horse, like the
mule, With no understanding, with bit and bridle, Else they do not come near
you.”
Psalm
32:10  Many are the sorrows of the wrong;
But as for the one trusting in יהוה, Kindness surrounds
him.
Psalm
32:11  Be glad in יהוה
and exult, you righteous; And shout for joy, all you upright in heart!
Psalm
33:1  Shout for joy in יהוה,
you righteous! Praise is fitting for the straight!
Psalm
33:2  Praise יהוה
with the lyre; Sing to Him with an instrument of ten strings.
Psalm
33:3  Sing to Him a new song; Play
sweetly with a shout of joy.
Psalm
33:4  For the Word of יהוה
is straight, And all His works are in truth,
Psalm
33:5  Loving righteousness and
right-ruling; The earth is filled with the kindness of יהוה.
Psalm
33:6  By the Word of יהוה
the heavens were made, And all their host by the Spirit of His mouth,
Psalm
33:7  Gathering the waters of the sea
together as a heap; Laying up the deep in storehouses.
Psalm
33:8  Let all the earth fear יהוה
; Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of Him.
Psalm
33:9  For He spoke, and it came to be; He
commanded, and it stood fast.
Psalm
33:10  יהוה
brings the counsel of the nations to naught; He thwarts the plans of the
peoples.
Psalm
33:11  The counsel of יהוה
stands forever, The plans of His heart to all generations.
Psalm
33:12  Blessed is the nation whose Elohim
is יהוה, The people whom He has chosen as His own
inheritance.
Psalm
33:13  יהוה has
looked from the heavens; He has seen all the sons of men.
Psalm
33:14  He looked from His dwelling place
On all the inhabitants of the earth –
Psalm
33:15  He who fashions the hearts of them
all, He who understands all their works.
Psalm
33:16  The sovereign is not saved by the
multitude of an army; A mighty man is not delivered by great strength.
Psalm
33:17  A horse is a vain means of safety;
Neither does it rescue any by its great power.
Psalm
33:18  See, the eye of יהוה
is on those fearing Him, On those waiting for His kindness,
Psalm
33:19  To deliver their being from death,
And to keep them alive during scarcity of food.
Psalm
33:20  Our being has longed for יהוה
; Our help and our shield is He.
Psalm
33:21  For our heart does rejoice in Him,
For we have put our trust in His set-apart Name.
Psalm
33:22  Let Your kindness, O יהוה,
be upon us, Even as we wait for You.
Psalm
34:1  I bless יהוה
at all times; His praise is continually in my mouth.
Psalm
34:2  My being makes its boast in יהוה
; Let the humble hear and be glad.
Psalm
34:3  Oh, make יהוה
great with me, And let us exalt His Name together.
Psalm
34:4  I sought יהוה,
and He answered me, And delivered me from all my fears.
Psalm
34:5  They looked to Him and were
lightened, And their faces were not ashamed.
Psalm
34:6  This poor one cried out and יהוה
heard him, And saved him out of all his distresses.
Psalm
34:7  The messenger of יהוה
encamps all around those who fear Him, And rescues them.
Psalm
34:8  Oh, taste and see that יהוה
is good; Blessed is the man that takes refuge in Him!
Psalm
34:9  Fear יהוה,
you His set-apart ones, For there is no lack to them who fear Him!
Psalm
34:10  Young lions have lacked and been
hungry; But those who seek יהוה lack not any good matter.
Psalm
34:11  Come, you children, listen to me;
Let me teach you the fear of יהוה.
Psalm
34:12  Who is the man who desires life,
Who loves many days, in order to see good?
Psalm
34:13  Keep your tongue from evil, And
your lips from speaking deceit.
Psalm
34:14  Turn away from evil and do good;
Seek peace, and pursue it.
Psalm
34:15  The eyes of יהוה
are on the righteous, And His ears unto their cry.
Psalm
34:16  The face of יהוה
is against evil-doers, To cut off their remembrance from the earth.
Psalm
34:17  The righteous cried out, and יהוה heard,
And delivered them out of all their distresses.
Psalm
34:18  יהוה is
near to the broken-hearted, And saves those whose spirit is crushed.
Psalm
34:19  Many are the evils of the
righteous, But יהוה delivers him out of them all.
Psalm
34:20  He is guarding all his bones; Not
one of them is broken.
Psalm
34:21  Evil does slay the wrong, And
those who hate the righteous are guilty.
Psalm
34:22  יהוה
redeems the lives of His servants, And none of those taking refuge in Him are
guilty.
Psalm
35:1  O יהוה,
strive with those who strive with me; Fight against those who fight against me.
Psalm
35:2  Take hold of shield and armour, And
rise for my help.
Psalm
35:3  And draw out spear and lance, To
meet those who pursue me. Say to my life, “I am your deliverance.”
Psalm
35:4  Let those be ashamed and blush Who
seek my life; Let those be turned back and abashed Who plot evil to me.
Psalm
35:5  Let them be as chaff before the
wind, With a messenger of יהוה driving on.
Psalm
35:6  Let their way be dark and slippery,
With a messenger of יהוה pursuing them.
Psalm
35:7  For without cause they hid their
net for me; Without cause they dug a pit
for my life.
Psalm
35:8  Let ruin come upon him unawares,
And let his net that he hid catch himself; Let him fall in it, into ruin.
Psalm
35:9  But let my own being exult in יהוה
; Let it rejoice in His deliverance.
Psalm
35:10  Let all my bones say, “ יהוה,
who is like You, Delivering the poor from one stronger than he, And the poor
and the needy from him who robs him?”
Psalm
35:11  Ruthless witnesses rise up; They
ask me that which I knew not.
Psalm
35:12  They reward me evil for good,
bereaving my life.
Psalm
35:13  But I, when they were sick, I put
on sackcloth; I humbled my being with fastings; And my prayer would return to
my own bosom.
Psalm
35:14  I walked about as though he were
my friend or brother; I bowed down mourning, as one mourning for a mother.
Psalm
35:15  But they rejoiced at my stumbling
And gathered together; The smiters gathered against me, And I did not know it;
They tore in pieces without ceasing,
Psalm
35:16  With unclean ones, mockers at
feasts, Gnashing at me with their teeth.
Psalm
35:17  יהוה, how
long would You look on? Rescue my being from their destructions, My only life from the lions.
Psalm
35:18  I give You thanks in the great
assembly; I praise You among a mighty people.
Psalm
35:19  Let not my lying enemies rejoice
over me; Or those who hate me without cause wink their eyes.
Psalm
35:20  For they do not speak peace, But
they devise words of deceit Against the peaceable ones of the land.
Psalm
35:21  And they open their mouth wide
against me, They said, “Aha, aha! Our eyes have seen it.”
Psalm
35:22  This You have seen, O יהוה
; Do not be silent. O יהוה, do not be far from me.
Psalm
35:23  Stir up Yourself and awake to my
right-ruling – To my cause, my Elohim and my Master.
Psalm
35:24  Rule me rightly, O יהוה
my Elohim, According to Your righteousness; And let them not rejoice over me.
Psalm
35:25  Let them not say in their hearts, “Aha,
our desire!” Let them not say, “We have swallowed him up.”
Psalm
35:26  Let those who are rejoicing at my
evil Be ashamed and abashed altogether; Let those who are exalting themselves
over me Be clad in shame and humiliation.
Psalm
35:27  Let those who delight in my
righteous cause Shout for joy and be glad, And let them always say, “Let יהוה
be made great, Who is desiring the peace of His servant.”
Psalm
35:28  And my tongue shall speak of Your
righteousness, Your praise, All day long.
Psalm
36:1  Transgression speaks to the wrong
within his heart; Fear of Elohim is not before his eyes.
Psalm
36:2  For he flatters himself in his own
eyes, To find his crookedness to be hated.
Psalm
36:3  The words of his mouth are
wickedness and deceit; He has ceased to be wise, to do good.
Psalm
36:4  He plots wickedness on his bed; He
sets himself in a way that is not good; He does not despise evil.
Psalm
36:5  O יהוה,
Your kindness is in the heavens, And Your trustworthiness reaches to the
clouds.
Psalm
36:6  Your righteousness is like the
mighty mountains; Your right-rulings are a great deep; O יהוה,
You save man and beast.
Psalm
36:7  How precious is Your kindness, O
Elohim! And the sons of men take refuge in the shadow of Your wings.
Psalm
36:8  They are filled from the fatness of
Your house, And You give them drink from the river of Your pleasures.
Psalm
36:9  For with You is the fountain of
life; In Your light we see light.
Psalm
36:10  Draw out Your kindness to those
who know You, And Your righteousness to the upright in heart.
Psalm
36:11  Let not the foot of pride come
against me, And the hand of the wrong drive me away.
Psalm
36:12  There the workers of wickedness
have fallen; They have been overthrown And have been unable to rise.
Psalm
37:1  Do not fret because of evil-doers,
Do not be envious of the workers of unrighteousness. 
Psalm
37:2  For they soon wither like grass,
And fade like green plants.
Psalm
37:3  Trust in יהוה,
and do good; Dwell in the earth, and feed on steadfastness.
Psalm
37:4  And delight yourself in יהוה,
And let Him give you the desires of your heart.
Psalm
37:5  Commit your way to יהוה,
And trust in Him, and He does it.
Psalm
37:6  And He shall bring forth your
righteousness as the light, And your right-ruling as midday.
Psalm
37:7  Rest in יהוה,
and wait patiently for Him; Do not fret because of him who prospers in his way,
Because of the man doing wicked devices.
Psalm
37:8  Abstain from displeasure, and
forsake wrath; Do not fret, also to do evil.
Psalm
37:9  For evil-doers are cut off; But
those who wait on יהוה, They shall inherit the earth.
Psalm
37:10  Yet a little while and the wrong
is no more; And you shall look on his place, But it is not.
Psalm
37:11  But the meek ones shall inherit
the earth, And delight themselves in plenty of peace.
Psalm
37:12  The wrong plots against the
righteous, And gnashes his teeth at him.
Psalm
37:13  יהוה
laughs at him, For He sees that his day is coming.
Psalm
37:14  The wrong have drawn the sword And
have bent their bow, To cause the poor and needy to fall, To slay those who
walk straightly.
Psalm
37:15  Their sword does enter into their
own heart, And their bows are broken.
Psalm
37:16  Better is the little of the
righteous one, Than the riches of many wrongdoers.
Psalm
37:17  For the arms of the wrongdoers are
broken, But יהוה sustains the righteous.
Psalm
37:18  יהוה knows
the days of the perfect, And their inheritance is forever.
Psalm
37:19  They are not ashamed in a time of
evil, And in the days of scarcity of food they are satisfied.
Psalm
37:20  But the wrongdoers shall perish;
And the enemies of יהוה, Like the splendour of the meadows
they vanish, Like smoke they vanish away.
Psalm
37:21  The wrongdoer is borrowing and
does not repay, But the righteous one shows favour and gives.
Psalm
37:22  For His blessed ones inherit the
earth, But those cursed by Him are cut off.
Psalm
37:23  The steps of a man are ordered by יהוה,
And He delights in his way.
Psalm
37:24  Though he falls, he is not cast
down, For יהוה is supporting his hand.
Psalm
37:25  I have been young, and now I am
old; Yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken, Or his seed begging bread.
Psalm
37:26  All day long he is showing favour
and lending; And his seed is for a blessing.
Psalm
37:27  Turn away from evil, and do good;
And dwell forever.
Psalm
37:28  For יהוה
loves right-ruling, And does not forsake His kind ones; They shall be guarded
forever, But the seed of the wrongdoers is cut off.
Psalm
37:29  The righteous shall inherit the
earth, And dwell in it forever.
Psalm
37:30  The mouth of the righteous speaks
wisdom, And his tongue talks of right-ruling.
Psalm
37:31  The Torah of his Elohim is in his
heart; His steps do not slide.
Psalm
37:32  The wrong one is watching for the
righteous, And is seeking to slay him.
Psalm
37:33  יהוה does
not leave him in his hand, Or let him be declared wrong when he is judged.
Psalm
37:34  Wait on יהוה
and guard His way, And He shall exalt you to inherit the earth – When the
wrongdoers are cut off, you shall see it.
Psalm
37:35  I have seen the wrongdoer in great
power, And spreading himself like a native green tree.
Psalm
37:36  Yet he passed away, and see, he
was not; And I sought him, but he was not found.
Psalm
37:37  Watch the perfect, and observe the
straight; For the latter end of each is peace.
Psalm
37:38  But the transgressors shall be
destroyed together; The latter end of the wrong shall be cut off.
Psalm
37:39  But the deliverance of the
righteous is from יהוה, Their strength in time of
distress.
Psalm
37:40  And יהוה
does help them and deliver them; He delivers them from the wrongdoers and saves
them, Because they took refuge in Him.
Psalm
38:1  O יהוה, do
not rebuke me in Your wrath, Nor chastise me in Your hot displeasure!
Psalm
38:2  For Your arrows have pierced me,
And Your hand comes down on me.
Psalm
38:3  There is no soundness in my flesh
because of Your rage, Nor peace in my bones because of my sin.
Psalm
38:4  For my crookednesses have passed
over my head; Like a heavy burden, too heavy for me.
Psalm
38:5  My wounds have become stinky,
festering Because of my folly.
Psalm
38:6  I have been bent down; I have been
bowed down very much; All day long I have gone mourning.
Psalm
38:7  For my loins have become filled
with burning, And there is no soundness in my flesh.
Psalm
38:8  I have become weak and greatly
crushed; I howled from the groaning of my heart.
Psalm
38:9  יהוה, all
my desire is before You; And my sighing has not been hid from You.
Psalm
38:10  My heart is throbbing, my strength
has forsaken me; And the light of my eyes also is not with me.
Psalm
38:11  My loved ones and my friends stand
back from my plague, And my neighbours stand far away.
Psalm
38:12  And those seeking my life lay a
snare; And those seeking my evil have spoken of destruction, And utter deceit
all day long.
Psalm
38:13  But I, as one deaf, do not hear;
And as a dumb one who does not open his mouth.
Psalm
38:14  I am like a man who does not hear,
And who has no rebukes in his mouth.
Psalm
38:15  For on You, O יהוה,
I have waited; You do answer, O יהוה my Elohim.
Psalm
38:16  For I said, “Otherwise they would
rejoice over me, When my foot slips they would exalt themselves over me.”
Psalm
38:17  For I am ready to fall, And my
pain is always with me.
Psalm
38:18  For I confess my crookedness; I am
sorry over my sin.
Psalm
38:19  But my enemies are alive; They
have become strong; And those hating me falsely are many.
Psalm
38:20  And those who repay evil for good,
They oppose me, because I follow what is good.
Psalm
38:21  Do not forsake me, O יהוה
; O my Elohim, be not far from me!
Psalm
38:22  Hasten to help me, O יהוה,
my deliverance!
Psalm
39:1  I have said,“Let me guard my ways
Against sinning with my tongue; Let me guard my mouth with a muzzle, While the
wrongdoer is before me.” 
Psalm
39:2  I became dumb, keeping still; I was
silent, from good; And my pain was stirred.
Psalm
39:3  My heart was hot within me; While I
was meditating, the fire burned. Then I spoke with my tongue:
Psalm
39:4  “ יהוה, let
me know my end, And the measure of my days, what it is, Let me know how
short-lived I am.
Psalm
39:5  “See, You have made my days as
handbreadths, And my lifetime is as non-existence before You; Only, all men
standing, are all breath. Selah.
Psalm
39:6  “As but a shadow each one walks;
They busy themselves, only in vain; He heaps up wealth, But knows not who gathers them.
Psalm
39:7  “And now, יהוה,
what do I wait for? My expectancy is in You.
Psalm
39:8  “Deliver me from all my
transgressions; Do not make me the reproach of the foolish.
Psalm
39:9  “I was dumb, I did not open my
mouth, Because it was You who did it.
Psalm
39:10  “Turn aside Your stroke from me; I
am overcome by the blow of Your hand.
Psalm
39:11  “When You chastise man for
crookedness with reproofs, You consume what he loves, like a moth; All men are
but a breath. Selah.
Psalm
39:12  “Hear my prayer, O יהוה,
And give ear to my cry; Do not be silent at my tears; For I am a stranger with
You, A sojourner, as all my fathers were.
Psalm
39:13  “Look away from me, That I might
brighten up, Before I go away and am no more.”
Psalm
40:1  I waited, waited for יהוה
; And He inclined to me, and heard my cry.
Psalm
40:2  And He drew me Out of the pit of
destruction, Out of the muddy clay, And He set my feet upon a rock, He is
establishing my steps.
Psalm
40:3  Then He put a new song in my mouth;
Praise to our Elohim; Many do see it and fear, And trust in יהוה.
Psalm
40:4  Blessed is that man who has made יהוה
his trust, And has not turned to the proud, And those turning aside to
falsehood.
Psalm
40:5  O יהוה my
Elohim, many are the wonders Which You have done, and Your purposes toward us;
There is no one to compare with You; I declare and speak: They are too many to
be numbered.
Psalm
40:6  Slaughtering and meal offering You
did not desire; You have opened my ears; Burnt offering and sin offering You
did not ask for.
Psalm
40:7  Then I said, “See, I have come; In
the scroll of the Book it is prescribed for me.
Psalm
40:8  I have delighted to do Your
pleasure, O my Elohim, And Your Torah is within my heart.”
Psalm
40:9  I have proclaimed the good news of
righteousness, In the great assembly; See, I do not restrain my lips, O יהוה,
You know.
Psalm
40:10  I did not conceal Your
righteousness within my heart; I have declared Your trustworthiness and Your deliverance;
I did not hide Your kindness and Your truth From the great assembly.
Psalm
40:11  Do not withhold Your compassion
from me, O יהוה ; Let Your kindness and Your truth
always watch over me.
Psalm
40:12  For evils without number have
surrounded me; My crookednesses have overtaken me, And I have been unable to
see; They became more than the hairs of my head; And my heart has failed me.
Psalm
40:13  Be pleased, O יהוה,
to deliver me; O יהוה, hasten to help me!
Psalm
40:14  Let those who seek to destroy my
life Be ashamed and abashed altogether; Let those who are desiring my evil Be
driven back and put to shame.
Psalm
40:15  Let those who say to me, “Aha,
aha!” Be appalled at their own shame.
Psalm
40:16  Let all those who seek You Rejoice
and be glad in You; Let those who love Your deliverance always say, “ יהוה
be exalted!”
Psalm
40:17  But I am poor and needy; Let יהוה
think upon me. You are my help and my deliverer; O my Elohim, do not delay!
Psalm
41:1  Blessed is he who considers the
poor; יהוה does deliver him in a day of evil.
Psalm
41:2  יהוה does
guard him and keep him alive; He is blessed on the earth, And You do not hand
him over To the desire of his enemies.
Psalm
41:3  יהוה
sustains him on his sickbed; In his weakness on his bed You bring a change.
Psalm
41:4  As for me, I said, “O יהוה,
show me favour; Heal me, for I have sinned against You.”
Psalm
41:5  My enemies speak evil of me, “When
he dies his name shall perish.”
Psalm
41:6  And when one comes to visit, he
speaks falsely; His heart gathers wickedness to itself; He goes out, he speaks
of it.
Psalm
41:7  All who hate me whisper together
against me; They plot evil to me, saying,
Psalm
41:8  “A matter of Beliya‛al is
poured out on him, That when he lies down, he would not rise again.”
Psalm
41:9  Even my own friend in whom I
trusted, who ate my bread, Has lifted up his heel against me.
Psalm
41:10  But You, יהוה,
show me favour and raise me up, And let me repay them.
Psalm
41:11  By this I know that You did
delight in me, Because my enemy does not shout for joy over me.
Psalm
41:12  And I, You uphold me in my
integrity, And set me before Your face forever.
Psalm
41:13  Blessed be יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl From everlasting to everlasting! Amĕn and Amĕn.
Psalm
42:1  As a deer longs for the water
streams, So my being longs for You, O Elohim.
Psalm
42:2  My being thirsts for Elohim, for
the living Ĕl. When shall I enter in to appear before Elohim?
Psalm
42:3  My tears have been my food day and
night, While they say to me all day, “Where is your Elohim?”
Psalm
42:4  These I remember, and pour out my
being within me. For I used to pass along with the throng; I went with them to
the House of Elohim, With the voice of joy and praise, A multitude keeping a
festival!
Psalm
42:5  Why are you depressed, O my being?
And why are you restless within me?
Wait for Elohim: for I shall yet thank Him, For
the deliverance of His face!
Psalm
42:6  O my Elohim, my being is depressed
within me; Therefore I remember You from the land of the Yardĕn, And from
the heights of Ḥermon, From Mount Mits‛ar.
Psalm
42:7  Deep calls to deep at the sound of
Your waterfalls; All Your waves and breakers passed over me.
Psalm
42:8  By day יהוה
commands His kindness, And by night His song is with me; A prayer to the Ĕl
of my life.
Psalm
42:9  I say to Ĕl my Rock, “Why have
You forgotten me? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?”
Psalm
42:10  My enemies have reproached me,
Like a crushing of my bones, While they say to me all day long, “Where is your
Elohim?”
Psalm
42:11  Why are you depressed, O my being?
And why are you restless within me? Wait for Elohim: for I shall yet thank Him,
the deliverance of my face, And my Elohim.
Psalm
43:1  Rule me rightly, O Elohim, And
plead my cause against a nation without kindness. Oh, deliver me from a man of
deceit and unrighteousness!
Psalm
43:2  For You are the Elohim of my
strength. Why have You rejected me? Why do I go mourning because of the
oppression of the enemy?
Psalm
43:3  Send forth Your light and Your
truth! Let them lead me, Let them bring me to Your set-apart mountain And to
Your dwelling places.
Psalm
43:4  That I might come to the altar of
Elohim, To Ĕl, the joy of my delight, And praise You with the lyre, O
Elohim, my Elohim.
Psalm
43:5  Why are you depressed, O my being?
And why are you restless within me? Wait for Elohim: for I shall yet thank Him,
the deliverance of my face, And my Elohim.
Psalm
44:1  O Elohim, we have heard with our
ears, Our fathers have related to us, The work You did in their days, In the
days of old.
Psalm
44:2  You drove out the nations with Your
hand, But them You planted. You afflicted peoples, and sent them out.
Psalm
44:3  For not by their own sword did they
possess the land, Neither did their own arm save them; But it was Your right
hand and Your arm, And the light of Your face, Because You delighted in them.
Psalm
44:4  You Yourself are my Sovereign, O
Elohim; Command deliverances for Ya‛aqoḇ.
Psalm
44:5  Through You we push our enemies;
Through Your Name we tread down those who rise up against us.
Psalm
44:6  For I do not trust in my bow, And
my sword does not save me.
Psalm
44:7  For You have saved us from our
enemies, And have put to shame those who hated us.
Psalm
44:8  In Elohim we shall boast all day
long, And praise Your Name forever. Selah.
Psalm
44:9  Yet You have rejected us and put us
to shame, And You do not go with our armies.
Psalm
44:10  You make us turn back from the
adversary, And those who hate us have plundered us.
Psalm
44:11  You do give us as sheep to be
eaten, And You have scattered us among the gentiles.
Psalm
44:12  You sell Your people for no value,
And have set no high price on them.
Psalm
44:13  You make us a reproach to our
neighbours, A scorn and a mockery to those round about us.
Psalm
44:14  You make us a proverb among the
nations, A shaking of the head among the peoples.
Psalm
44:15  My reproach is always before me,
And the shame of my face has covered me,
Psalm
44:16  Because of the voice of the
slanderer and blasphemer, Because of the enemy and avenger.
Psalm
44:17  All this has come upon us; But we
have not forgotten You, Neither have we been false to Your covenant.
Psalm
44:18  Our heart has not turned back,
Neither has our step swerved from Your way,
Psalm
44:19  Yet You have crushed us in the
place of jackals, And covered us with the shadow of death.
Psalm
44:20  If we have forgotten the Name of
our Elohim, Or stretched out our hands to a foreign mighty one,
Psalm
44:21  Would Elohim not search this out?
For He knows the secrets of the heart.
Psalm
44:22  But for Your sake we are killed
all day long; Reckoned as sheep for the slaughter.
Psalm
44:23  Awake! Why do You sleep, O יהוה
? Arise! Do not reject us forever.
Psalm
44:24  Why do You hide Your face,
Ignoring our affliction and our oppression?
Psalm
44:25  For our being is bowed down to the
dust; Our body cleaves to the earth.
Psalm
44:26  Arise, be our help, And redeem us
for Your kindness’ sake.
Psalm
45:1  My heart is overflowing with a
goodly word; I address my works to the Sovereign; My tongue is the pen of a
speedy writer.
Psalm
45:2  You are more handsome than the sons
of men; Favour has been poured upon Your lips; Therefore Elohim has blessed You
forever.
Psalm
45:3  Gird Your sword upon Your thigh, O Mighty One, Your
excellency and Your splendour.
Psalm
45:4  And ride prosperously in Your
splendour, On the matter of truth and humility, righteousness; And let Your
right hand lead You to awesome matters.
Psalm
45:5  Your arrows are sharp In the heart
of the Sovereign’s enemies – Peoples fall under You.
Psalm
45:6  Your throne, O Elohim, is forever
and ever; The sceptre of Your reign Is a sceptre of straightness.
Psalm
45:7  You have loved righteousness and
hated wrongness; Therefore Elohim, Your Elohim, has anointed You With the oil
of gladness more than Your companions.
Psalm
45:8  All Your garments are myrrh and
aloes, cassia; Out of the palaces of ivory, Stringed instruments have made You
glad.
Psalm
45:9  Daughters of sovereigns are among
Your precious ones; At Your right hand stands the sovereigness in gold from
Ophir.
Psalm
45:10  Listen, O daughter, and see, And
incline your ear, And forget your own people and your father’s house;
Psalm
45:11  And let the Sovereign delight in
your loveliness; Because He is your Master – bow yourself to Him.
Psalm
45:12  And the daughter of Tsor with a
gift, The rich among the people seek your favour.
Psalm
45:13  The daughter of the Sovereign Is
all esteemed within the palace; Her
dress is embroidered with gold.
Psalm
45:14  She is brought to the Sovereign in
embroidered work; Maidens, her companions following her, Are brought to You.
Psalm
45:15  They are brought with gladness and
rejoicing; They enter the Sovereign’s palace.
Psalm
45:16  Instead of Your fathers are Your
sons, Whom You appoint princes in all the earth.
Psalm
45:17  I cause Your Name to be remembered
in all generations; Therefore the people praise You forever and ever.
Psalm
46:1  Elohim is our refuge and strength,
A help in distress, soon found.
Psalm
46:2  Therefore we do not fear, Though
the earth reels And mountains topple into the heart of the seas.
Psalm
46:3  Let its waters rage, foam; Let
mountains shake with its swelling. Selah.
Psalm
46:4  A river whose streams Make glad the
city of Elohim, The set-apart dwelling of the Most High.
Psalm
46:5  Elohim is in her midst, she does
not topple; Elohim does help her when morning turns.
Psalm
46:6  The gentiles shall rage, Reigns
shall topple; He shall give forth His voice, The earth melts.
Psalm
46:7  יהוה of
hosts is with us; The Elohim of Ya‛aqoḇ is our refuge. Selah.
Psalm
46:8  Come, see the works of יהוה,
The ruins He has wrought on the earth,
Psalm
46:9  Causing all fighting to cease, Unto the end of the earth. He breaks the bow
and shatters the spear; He burns the chariot with fire.
Psalm
46:10  Be still, and know that I am
Elohim; I am exalted among nations, I am exalted in the earth!
Psalm
46:11  יהוה of
hosts is with us; The Elohim of Ya‛aqoḇ is our refuge. Selah.
Psalm
47:1  Oh, clap your hands, all you
peoples! Shout to Elohim with a voice of singing!
Psalm
47:2  For יהוה
Most High is awesome; A great Sovereign over all the earth.
Psalm
47:3  He subdues peoples under us, And
nations under our feet.
Psalm
47:4  He chooses our inheritance for us,
The excellence of Ya‛aqoḇ whom He loves. Selah.
Psalm
47:5  Elohim shall go up with a shout, יהוה
with the sound of a ram’s horn.
Psalm
47:6  Sing praises to Elohim, sing
praises! Sing praises to our Sovereign, sing praises!
Psalm
47:7  For Elohim is Sovereign of all the
earth; Sing praises with understanding.
Psalm
47:8  Elohim shall reign over the
nations; Elohim shall sit on His set-apart throne.
Psalm
47:9  Nobles of peoples shall be gathered
together, The people of the Elohim of Aḇraham. For the shields of the
earth belong to Elohim; He shall be greatly exalted.
Psalm
48:1  Great is יהוה,
and greatly to be praised In the city of our Elohim, His set-apart mountain.
Psalm
48:2  Pretty on high, The joy of all the
earth, Is Mount Tsiyon on the sides of the north, The city of the great
Sovereign.
Psalm
48:3  Elohim is in her citadels; He is
known as her refuge.
Psalm
48:4  For look, the sovereigns met, They
passed by together.
Psalm
48:5  They saw, so they marvelled; They
were alarmed, they hastened away.
Psalm
48:6  Trembling took hold of them there,
Pain, as of a woman in labour,
Psalm
48:7  With an east wind You break the
ships of Tarshish. 
Psalm
48:8  As we have heard, so we have seen In
the city of יהוה of hosts, In the city of our Elohim,
Elohim establishes her forever. Selah.
Psalm
48:9  We have thought, O Elohim, of Your
kindness, In the midst of Your Hĕḵal.
Psalm
48:10  According to Your Name, O Elohim,
So is Your praise to the ends of the earth; Your right hand is filled with
righteousness.
Psalm
48:11  Let Mount Tsiyon rejoice, Let the
daughters of Yehuḏah exult, Because of Your right-rulings.
Psalm
48:12  Walk about Tsiyon, And go all
around her. Count her towers;
Psalm
48:13  Set your heart upon her rampart;
Go through her citadels; So that you report it to the coming generation.
Psalm
48:14  For this Elohim is our Elohim,
Forever and ever; He Himself leads us, Even to death.
Psalm
49:1  Hear this, all you peoples; Give
ear, all you inhabitants of the world,
Psalm
49:2  Both sons of mankind and sons of
man, Rich and poor together.
Psalm
49:3  My mouth speaks wisdom, And the
meditation of my heart brings understanding.
Psalm
49:4  I incline my ear to a parable; I
expound my riddle on the lyre.
Psalm
49:5  Why should I fear in the days of
evil, When the crookedness of my supplanters surrounds me?
Psalm
49:6  Those who are trusting in their
riches And who are boasting in their great wealth?
Psalm
49:7  A brother does not redeem anyone at
all, Neither give to Elohim a ransom for him;
Psalm
49:8  For the redemption of their lives
is costly, And it shall cease forever;
Psalm
49:9  That he should still live forever, And not see the Pit.
Psalm
49:10  For he sees wise men die, The
foolish and the ignorant both perish, And shall leave their wealth to others.
Psalm
49:11  Their graves are their houses,
forever; Their dwelling places, to all generations; They call their lands after their own names.
Psalm
49:12  But man does not remain in esteem,
He is like the beasts that perish.
Psalm
49:13  This way of theirs is folly to
them, Yet their followers are pleased with their words. Selah.
Psalm
49:14  Like sheep they shall be laid in
the grave; Death shall shepherd them; And the upright rule over them in the
morning; And their form is consumed in the grave, Far from their dwelling.
Psalm
49:15  But Elohim does redeem my being
From the power of the grave, For He does receive me. Selah.
Psalm
49:16  Do not be afraid when a man
becomes rich, When the wealth of his house increases;
Psalm
49:17  For when he dies he takes none of
it; His wealth does not go down after him.
Psalm
49:18  Though while he lived he blessed
himself, And though they praise you when you do well for yourself,
Psalm
49:19  He has to go to the generation of
his fathers; They never see the light.
Psalm
49:20  Man, who is rich, Yet does not
understand, Shall be like the beasts, They shall perish.
Psalm
50:1  Ĕl Elohim יהוה
shall speak, And He shall call the earth From the rising of the sun to its
going down.
Psalm
50:2  From Tsiyon, the perfection of
loveliness, Elohim shall shine forth.
Psalm
50:3  Our Elohim comes, and is not silent
– A fire consumes before Him, And it shall be very stormy all around Him.
Psalm
50:4  He calls to the heavens from above,
And to the earth, to rightly rule His people:
Psalm
50:5  “Gather My kind ones together to
Me, Those who have made a covenant with Me by slaughtering.”
Psalm
50:6  Then the heavens declared His
righteousness, For Elohim Himself is Judge. Selah.
Psalm
50:7  “Hear, O My people, and I speak, O
Yisra’ĕl, and I witness against you: I am Elohim, your Elohim!
Psalm
50:8  “I do not reprove you for your
slaughterings, And your burnt offerings are continually before Me.
Psalm
50:9  “I do not take a bull from your
house, Nor goats out of your pens.
Psalm
50:10  “For every beast of the forest is
Mine, The cattle on a thousand hills.
Psalm
50:11  “I know all the birds of the
mountains, And all moving in My field are Mine.
Psalm
50:12  “If I were hungry, I would not
speak to you; For the world is Mine, and all that fills it.
Psalm
50:13  “Do I eat the flesh of bulls, Or
drink the blood of goats?
Psalm
50:14  “Offer thanksgiving to Elohim, And
pay your vows to the Most High.
Psalm
50:15  “And call upon Me in the day of
distress – Let Me rescue you, and you esteem Me.”
Psalm
50:16  But to the wrong Elohim said, “What
right have you to recite My laws, Or take My covenant in your mouth,
Psalm
50:17  “While you hated instruction And
cast My Words behind you?
Psalm
50:18  “When you saw a thief, you were
pleased with him, And you take part with adulterers.
Psalm
50:19  “You let your mouth loose to evil,
And your tongue frames deceit.
Psalm
50:20  “You sit, speak against your
brother; You slander your own mother’s son.
Psalm
50:21  “You have done this, and I kept
silent; You have thought that I was altogether like you – I rebuke you, and set
it in order before your eyes.
Psalm
50:22  “Understand this please, you who
forget Eloah, Lest I tear you in pieces, With no one to deliver:
Psalm
50:23  “Whoever offers praise esteems Me;
And to him who prepares a way, I show the deliverance of Elohim.”
Psalm
51:1  Show me favour, O Elohim, According
to Your kindness; According to the greatness of Your compassion, Blot out my
transgressions.
Psalm
51:2  Wash me completely from my guilt,
And cleanse me from my sin.
Psalm
51:3  For I know my transgressions, And
my sin is ever before me.
Psalm
51:4  Against You, You alone, have I
sinned, And done evil in Your eyes; That You might be proven right in Your
words; Be clear when You judge.
Psalm
51:5  See, I was brought forth in
crookedness, And in sin my mother conceived me.
Psalm
51:6  See, You have desired truth in the
inward parts, And in the hidden part You make me know wisdom.
Psalm
51:7  Cleanse me with hyssop, and I am
clean; Wash me, and I am whiter than snow.
Psalm
51:8  Let me hear joy and gladness, Let
the bones You have crushed rejoice.
Psalm
51:9  Hide Your face from my sins, And
blot out all my crookednesses.
Psalm
51:10  Create in me a clean heart, O
Elohim, And renew a steadfast spirit within me.
Psalm
51:11  Do not cast me away from Your
presence, And do not take Your Set-apart Spirit from me.
Psalm
51:12  Restore to me the joy of Your
deliverance, And uphold me, Noble Spirit!
Psalm
51:13  Let me teach transgressors Your
ways, So that sinners turn back to You.
Psalm
51:14  Deliver me from blood-guilt, O
Elohim, Elohim of my deliverance, Let my tongue sing aloud of Your
righteousness.
Psalm
51:15  O יהוה,
open my lips, And that my mouth declare Your praise.
Psalm
51:16  For You do not desire
slaughtering, or I would give it; You do not delight in burnt offering.
Psalm
51:17  The slaughterings of Elohim are a
broken spirit, A heart broken and crushed, O Elohim, These You do not despise.
Psalm
51:18  Do good in Your good pleasure to
Tsiyon; Build the walls of Yerushalayim.
Psalm
51:19  Then You would delight in
slaughterings of righteousness, In burnt offering and complete burnt offering;
Then young bulls would be offered on Your altar.
Psalm
52:1  Why do you boast in evil, O mighty
man? The kindness of Ĕl is all day long!
Psalm
52:2  Your tongue devises destruction,
Like a sharp razor, working deceit.
Psalm
52:3  You loved evil more than good,
Lying more than speaking righteousness. Selah.
Psalm
52:4  You loved all devouring words, O
tongue of deceit.
Psalm
52:5  Let Ĕl also break you down
forever, Take you and pluck you out of your tent. And He shall uproot you From
the land of the living. Selah.
Psalm
52:6  And let the righteous see and fear,
And laugh at him, saying,
Psalm
52:7  “See the man who did not make
Elohim his strength, But trusted in his many riches, Being strong in his
destruction.”
Psalm
52:8  But I am like a green olive tree In
the House of Elohim, I have trusted in the kindness of Elohim Forever and ever.
Psalm
52:9  I thank You forever, Because You
have done it; And in the presence of Your kind ones I wait on Your Name, for it
is good.
Psalm
53:1  The fool has said in his heart, “There
is no Elohim.” They have done corruptly, And they have done abominable
unrighteousness; No one does good.
Psalm
53:2  Elohim looked down from the heavens
on the children of men, To see if there is a wise one, seeking Elohim.
Psalm
53:3  They have all turned aside; They
have together become filthy; No one is doing good, not even one.
Psalm
53:4  Have the workers of wickedness no
knowledge, Who eat up my people as they eat bread, And do not call on Elohim?
Psalm
53:5  There they are in great fear, Where
no fear was, For Elohim shall scatter the bones Of him who encamps against you.
You shall put them to shame, For Elohim has rejected them.
Psalm
53:6  O that the deliverance of Yisra’ĕl
Would be given out of Tsiyon! When Elohim turns back the captivity of His
people, Let Ya‛aqoḇ rejoice, let Yisra’ĕl be glad.
Psalm
54:1  O Elohim, save me by Your Name, And
rightly rule me by Your might.
Psalm
54:2  Hear my prayer, O Elohim; Give ear to
the words of my mouth.
Psalm
54:3  For strangers have risen up against
me, And cruel men have sought after my life; They have not set Elohim before
them. Selah.
Psalm
54:4  See, Elohim is my helper; יהוה
is with those who sustain my life.
Psalm
54:5  He repays evil to my enemies. Cut
them off in Your truth.
Psalm
54:6  Voluntarily I slaughter to You; I
praise Your Name, O יהוה, for it is good.
Psalm
54:7  For He has delivered me out of all
distress; And my eye has looked upon my enemies.
Psalm
55:1  Give ear to my prayer, O Elohim,
And do not hide Yourself from my plea.
Psalm
55:2  Give heed to me, and answer me; I
wander and moan in my complaint,
Psalm
55:3  Because of the noise of the enemy,
Because of the outcry of the wrong; For they bring down wickedness upon me, And
in wrath they hate me.
Psalm
55:4  My heart is pained within me, And
the frights of death have fallen upon me.
Psalm
55:5  Fear and trembling have come upon
me, And shuddering covers me.
Psalm
55:6  And I said, “Who would give me
wings like a dove! I would fly away and be at rest.
Psalm
55:7  “See, I would wander far off, I
would lodge in the wilderness. Selah.
Psalm
55:8  “I would hasten my escape From the
raging wind and storm.”
Psalm
55:9  Confuse, O יהוה,
divide their tongues, For I saw violence and strife in the city.
Psalm
55:10  Day and night they go around it on
its walls; Wickedness and trouble are also in the midst of it.
Psalm
55:11  Covetings are in its midst;
Oppression and deceit do not vanish from its streets.
Psalm
55:12  It is not an enemy who reproaches
me – That I could bear; Nor one who hates me who is making himself great
against me – Then I could hide from him.
Psalm
55:13  But it was you, a man my equal, My
companion and my friend.
Psalm
55:14  We took sweet counsel together, We
walked to the House of Elohim in the throng.
Psalm
55:15  Let death come upon them; Let them
go down into the grave alive, For evil is in their dwellings, in their midst.
Psalm
55:16  I, I call upon Elohim, And יהוה
saves me.
Psalm
55:17  Evening and morning and at noon I
complain and moan, And He hears my voice.
Psalm
55:18  He has redeemed my life in peace
From the battle against me, For there were many against me.
Psalm
55:19  Ĕl, even He who sits enthroned from of old, Does hear and
afflict them – Selah – Those with whom there are no changes, Those who do not
fear Elohim.
Psalm
55:20  He has put forth his hands against
those Who were at peace with him; He has broken his covenant.
Psalm
55:21  His mouth was smoother than curds,
Yet in his heart is fighting; His words were softer than oil, But they are
drawn swords.
Psalm
55:22  Cast your burden on יהוה,
And let Him sustain you; He never allows the righteous to be shaken.
Psalm
55:23  For You, O Elohim, do bring them
down To the pit of destruction; Men of blood and deceit do not reach half their
days; But I, I trust in You.
Psalm
56:1  Show me favour, O Elohim, For man
would swallow me up; Fighting all day long, he oppresses me.
Psalm
56:2  My enemies would swallow me up all
day long, For many are fighting against me, O Most High.
Psalm
56:3  In the day I am afraid, I trust in
You. 
Psalm
56:4  In Elohim, whose Word I praise, In
Elohim I have trusted; I do not fear; What could flesh do to me?
Psalm
56:5  All day long they twist my words;
All their thoughts are against me for evil.
Psalm
56:6  They stir up strife, they hide,
They watch my steps, As they lie in wait for my life.
Psalm
56:7  Because of wickedness, cast them
out. Put down the peoples in displeasure, O Elohim!
Psalm
56:8  You have counted my wanderings; You
put my tears into Your bottle; Are they not in Your book?
Psalm
56:9  My enemies turn back in the day I
call; This I know, because Elohim is for me.
Psalm
56:10  In Elohim, whose Word I praise, In
יהוה, whose Word I praise,
Psalm
56:11  In Elohim I have trusted; I do not
fear; What could man do to me?
Psalm
56:12  On me, O Elohim, are Your vows; I
render praises to You,
Psalm
56:13  For You have delivered my life
from death, My feet from stumbling, That I might walk before Elohim, In the
light of the living!
Psalm
57:1  Show me favour, O Elohim, show me
favour! For in You my being is taking refuge; And in the shadow of Your wings I
take refuge, Until destruction passes by.
Psalm
57:2  I cry out to the Most High Elohim,
To Ĕl who is perfecting all matters
for me.
Psalm
57:3  He sends from the heavens and saves
me; He reproaches the one who would swallow me up. Selah. Elohim sends forth
His kindness and His truth.
Psalm
57:4  My being is in the midst of lions;
I lie among those who breathe fire,
Whose teeth are spears and arrows, And their tongue is a sharp sword.
Psalm
57:5  Be exalted, O Elohim, above the
heavens; Let Your esteem be above all the earth.
Psalm
57:6  They have prepared a net for my
footsteps; My being was bowed down; They have dug a pit before me; They fell
into the midst of it! Selah.
Psalm
57:7  My heart is firm, O Elohim, My
heart is firm; I sing and praise.
Psalm
57:8  Awake, my esteem! Awake, harp and
lyre! I awake the dawn.
Psalm
57:9  I praise You among the peoples, O יהוה
; I sing to You among the nations.
Psalm
57:10  For Your kindness is great up to
the heavens, And Your truth unto the clouds.
Psalm
57:11  Be exalted above the heavens, O
Elohim; Let Your esteem be above all the earth.
Psalm
58:1  Would you indeed speak
righteousness, in silence? Do you judge straightly, you sons of men?
Psalm
58:2  No, in heart you work
unrighteousness; On earth you weigh out the violence of your hands.
Psalm
58:3  The wrong have been estranged from
the womb; These who speak lies go astray from birth.
Psalm
58:4  Their poison is like the poison of
a snake; Like a deaf cobra that stops its ear,
Psalm
58:5  So as not to hear the voice of
whisperers, Or a skilled caster of spells.
Psalm
58:6  O Elohim, break their teeth in
their mouth! Break out the fangs of the young lions, O יהוה
!
Psalm
58:7  Let them melt, let them vanish as
water; Let Him aim His arrows that they be cut down;
Psalm
58:8  Like a snail which melts away as it
moves, Like a woman’s stillbirth, Let them not see the sun!
Psalm
58:9  Before your pots feel the thorns,
Whether green or ablaze, He sweeps them away.
Psalm
58:10  The righteous rejoices when he has
seen the vengeance, He washes his feet in the blood of the wrong,
Psalm
58:11  And man says, “Truly, the
righteous are rewarded; Truly, there is an Elohim judging in the earth.”
Psalm
59:1  Deliver me from my enemies, O my
Elohim; Set me on high from those who rise up against me.
Psalm
59:2  Deliver me from the workers of
wickedness, And save me from men of blood.
Psalm
59:3  For look, they have lain in wait
for my life; Mighty men assemble against me, For no transgression or sin of
mine, O יהוה,
Psalm
59:4  For no guilt of mine! They run and prepare themselves. Awake to help me, and
see!
Psalm
59:5  And You, יהוה
Elohim of hosts, Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, Awake to punish all the gentiles;
Show no favour to any wicked traitors. Selah.
Psalm
59:6  They return at evening, They howl
like a dog, And go around the city.
Psalm
59:7  See, they belch out with their
mouth, Swords are in their lips, For who is listening?
Psalm
59:8  But You, יהוה,
laughs at them, You mock all the gentiles.
Psalm
59:9  O my Strength, I wait for You; For
Elohim is my strong tower, My Elohim of kindness.
Psalm
59:10  Elohim does go before me, He lets
me look upon my enemies.
Psalm
59:11  Do not slay them, lest my people
forget; Scatter them by Your power, And bring them down, O יהוה
our shield.
Psalm
59:12  The sin of their mouth is the
words of their lips, And they are captured in their pride, And for the cursing
and lying they utter.
Psalm
59:13  Bring them to an end in wrath, Bring them
to an end, That they be no more; And let them know That Elohim is ruling in Ya‛aqoḇ
To the ends of the earth. Selah.
Psalm
59:14  And at evening they return, They
howl like a dog, And go around the city.
Psalm
59:15  They wander up and down for food,
And whine if they are not satisfied.
Psalm
59:16  And I, I sing of Your power; And
in the morning I sing aloud of Your kindness; For You have been my strong tower
And a refuge in the day of my distress.
Psalm
59:17  O my Strength, to You I sing
praises; For Elohim is my strong tower, My Elohim of kindness.
Psalm
60:1  O Elohim, You have rejected us; You
have broken us; You have been displeased; Turn back to us!
Psalm
60:2  You have made the earth tremble;
You have broken it; Heal its breaches, for it is shaken.
Psalm
60:3  You have let Your people see
hardship; You have made us drink the wine of trembling.
Psalm
60:4  You have given a banner to those
who fear You, That it might be lifted up Because of the truth. Selah.
Psalm
60:5  That those You love might be
rescued, Save with Your right hand and answer me.
Psalm
60:6  Elohim has spoken in His
set-apartness, “I exult, I portion out Sheḵem And measure out the Valley
of Sukkoth.
Psalm
60:7  “Gil‛aḏ is Mine and
Menashsheh is Mine, And Ephrayim is the defence of My head, Yehuḏah is My
lawgiver.
Psalm
60:8  “Mo’aḇ is My wash-pot, Over Eḏom
I cast My shoe, Shout loud, O Philistia, because of Me.”
Psalm
60:9  Who would bring me to the strong
city? Who shall lead me to Eḏom?
Psalm
60:10  Have not You, O Elohim, rejected
us? And You do not go out, O Elohim, With our armies!
Psalm
60:11  Give us help from distress, For
the help of man is naught.
Psalm
60:12  In Elohim we do mightily, And He
treads down our adversaries!
Psalm
61:1  Hear my cry, O Elohim, Listen to my
prayer.
Psalm
61:2  From the end of the earth I call
unto You, When my heart is faint; Lead me to the rock that is higher than I.
Psalm
61:3  For You have been my refuge, A
strong tower in the face of the enemy.
Psalm
61:4  Let me dwell in Your Tent forever,
Let me take refuge in the shelter of Your wings. Selah.
Psalm
61:5  For You, O Elohim, have heard my
vows; You have given me the inheritance Of those who fear Your Name.
Psalm
61:6  You add days to the days of the
sovereign, His years as many generations.
Psalm
61:7  Let him dwell forever before
Elohim. Prepare kindness and truth to preserve him!
Psalm
61:8  So I sing praise to Your Name
forever, When I pay my vows day by day.
Psalm
62:1  My being finds rest in Elohim
alone; From Him is my deliverance.
Psalm
62:2  He alone is my rock and my
deliverance, my strong tower; I am not greatly shaken.
Psalm
62:3  How long would you assail a man?
You crush him, all of you, Like a leaning wall, a tottering fence.
Psalm
62:4  They plotted to topple him from his
high position; They delight in lies; They bless with their mouth, But in their
heart they curse. Selah.
Psalm
62:5  My being, find rest in Elohim
alone, Because my expectation is from Him.
Psalm
62:6  He alone is my rock and my
deliverance, my strong tower; I am not shaken.
Psalm
62:7  My deliverance and my esteem depend on Elohim; The rock of my
strength, my refuge is in Elohim.
Psalm
62:8  Trust in Him at all times, you
people; Pour out your heart before Him; Elohim is a refuge for us. Selah.
Psalm
62:9  Sons of Aḏam are but a
breath, Sons of men are a lie; If weighed in the scales, They are altogether
lighter than breath.
Psalm
62:10  Do not trust in oppression. And do
not become vain in robbery; If riches increase, Do not set your heart on them.
Psalm
62:11  Elohim has spoken once, Twice I
have heard this: That strength belongs to Elohim.
Psalm
62:12  And kindness is Yours, O יהוה
; For You reward each one according to his work.
Psalm
63:1  O Elohim, You are my Ĕl; I
earnestly seek You; My being has thirsted for You; My flesh has longed for You
In a dry and thirsty land without water.
Psalm
63:2  Therefore I have had a vision of
You In the set-apart place, To see Your power and Your esteem.
Psalm
63:3  Because Your kindness is better
than life, My lips do praise You.
Psalm
63:4  Therefore I bless You while I live;
In Your Name I lift up my hands.
Psalm
63:5  My being is satisfied as with
marrow and fat, And my mouth praises You with singing lips.
Psalm
63:6  When I remember You on my bed, I
meditate on You in the night watches.
Psalm
63:7  For You have been my help, And in
the shadow of Your wings I sing.
Psalm
63:8  My being has closely followed You;
Your right hand did uphold me.
Psalm
63:9  But those who seek to destroy my
life, Go into the lower parts of the earth.
Psalm
63:10  They are handed over To the power
of the sword; They become a portion for jackals.
Psalm
63:11  But let the sovereign rejoice in
Elohim; Let everyone who swears by Him exult; For the mouth of those speaking
lies are stopped.
Psalm
64:1  Hear my voice, O Elohim, in my
meditation; Guard my life from the threats of the enemy.
Psalm
64:2  Hide me from the secret plans of
the evil-doers, From the tumult of the workers of wickedness,
Psalm
64:3  Who sharpen their tongue like a
sword, And aim their arrows, a bitter word,
Psalm
64:4  To shoot in ambush at someone
blameless, They shoot at him suddenly and do not fear.
Psalm
64:5  They arm themselves with an evil
word; They talk of hiding snares; They have said, “Who sees them?”
Psalm
64:6  They search out unrighteousnesses, “We
have perfected a well searched out plan.” For the inward part of man, and
heart, are deep.
Psalm
64:7  But Elohim does shoot at them with
an arrow; Their wounds shall be sudden.
Psalm
64:8  And they cause one to stumble,
Their own tongue is against them; All who see them flee away.
Psalm
64:9  And all men fear, And declare the
work of Elohim. And they shall wisely consider What He has done.
Psalm
64:10  The righteous rejoice in יהוה,
And shall take refuge in Him, And all the upright in heart praise Him.
Psalm
65:1  To You, stillness, praise, in
Tsiyon, O Elohim; And to You a vow is paid.
Psalm
65:2  To You who hears all prayer, all
flesh comes.
Psalm
65:3  Crooked matters were mightier than
I; As for our transgressions, You do cover them.
Psalm
65:4  Blessed is the one You choose, And
bring near to dwell in Your courts. We are satisfied with the goodness of Your
house, Your set-apart Hĕḵal.
Psalm
65:5  By awesome deeds in righteousness
You answer us, O Elohim of our deliverance, The Trust of all the ends of the
earth, And the distant seas;
Psalm
65:6  Who established the mountains by
His strength, Being girded with might;
Psalm
65:7  Who stills the roaring of the seas,
The roaring of their waves, And the uproar of the peoples.
Psalm
65:8  And they who dwell in the farthest
parts, Are afraid of Your signs; You make the outgoings of the morning and
evening rejoice.
Psalm
65:9  You have visited the earth and
watered it, You greatly enrich it; The river of Elohim is filled with water;
You provide their grain, For so You have prepared it.
Psalm
65:10  Its ridges have been filled, Its
furrows have been deepened, You make it soft with showers, You bless its
growth.
Psalm
65:11  You have crowned the year with
Your goodness, And Your paths drip with fatness.
Psalm
65:12  The pastures of the wilderness
drip, And the hills are girded with rejoicing.
Psalm
65:13  The meadows are dressed in flocks,
And valleys are covered with grain; They shout for joy and sing.
Psalm
66:1  Shout with joy to Elohim, All the
earth!
Psalm
66:2  Sing out the splendour of His Name;
Make His praise esteemed.
Psalm
66:3  Say to Elohim, “How awesome are
Your works! Through the greatness of Your power Your enemies pretend obedience
to You.
Psalm
66:4  “All the earth bow to You, They
sing praises to You, They praise Your Name.” Selah.
Psalm
66:5  Come and see the works of Elohim,
Awesome acts toward the sons of men.
Psalm
66:6  He has turned the sea into dry
land, They went through the river on foot. There we rejoiced in Him,
Psalm
66:7  Who rules by His power forever; His
eyes keeping watch on the gentiles; Let the rebellious not exalt themselves.
Selah.
Psalm
66:8  Bless our Elohim, you peoples! And
sound His praise abroad,
Psalm
66:9  Who keeps us in life, And does not
allow our feet to be moved.
Psalm
66:10  For You, O Elohim, have proved us;
You have refined us as silver is refined.
Psalm
66:11  You brought us into the net; You
laid affliction on our loins.
Psalm
66:12  You have let men ride at our head;
We went through fire and through water; But You brought us out to plenty.
Psalm
66:13  I enter Your house with burnt
offerings; I complete my vows to You,
Psalm
66:14  That which my lips have uttered
And my mouth spoke in my distress.
Psalm
66:15  Burnt offerings of fatlings I
offer to You, With the incense of rams; I offer bulls with goats. Selah.
Psalm
66:16  Come, hear, all you who fear
Elohim, And I relate what He has done for my being.
Psalm
66:17  I called to Him with my mouth, And
praise was in my tongue.
Psalm
66:18  If I have seen wickedness in my
heart, יהוה would not hear.
Psalm
66:19  Truly, Elohim has heard me; He has
given heed to the voice of my prayer.
Psalm
66:20  Blessed be Elohim, Who has not
turned away my prayer, Nor His kindness from me!
Psalm
67:1  Elohim does favour us and bless us,
Cause His face to shine upon us. Selah.
Psalm
67:2  For Your way to be known on earth,
Your deliverance among all nations.
Psalm
67:3  Let the peoples praise You, O
Elohim, Let all the peoples praise You.
Psalm
67:4  Let the nations be glad and sing
for joy! For You judge the peoples uprightly, And lead the nations on earth.
Selah.
Psalm
67:5  Let the peoples praise You, O
Elohim; Let all the peoples praise You.
Psalm
67:6  The earth shall give her increase;
Elohim, our own Elohim, blesses us!
Psalm
67:7  Elohim blesses us! And all the ends
of the earth fear Him!
Psalm
68:1  Elohim arises, His enemies are
scattered. And those who hate Him flee before Him!
Psalm
68:2  As smoke is driven away, You drive them away; As wax melts before the
fire, The wrong perish before Elohim.
Psalm
68:3  But the righteous are glad, They
exult before Elohim. And they rejoice with gladness.
Psalm
68:4  Sing to Elohim, sing praises to His
Name. Raise up a highway for Him Who rides through the deserts, By His Name
Yah, And exult before Him.
Psalm
68:5  Father of the fatherless, And
Right-ruler of widows, Is Elohim in His set-apart dwelling.
Psalm
68:6  Elohim makes a home for the lonely;
He brings out into prosperity Those who are bound with chains; Only the
rebellious shall dwell in a dry land.
Psalm
68:7  O Elohim, when You went out before
Your people, When You stepped through the wilderness, Selah.
Psalm
68:8  The earth shook and the heavens
dropped before Elohim, This Sinai, shook before Elohim, the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl.
Psalm
68:9  You, O Elohim, sent a shower of
plenty, You confirmed Your inheritance, When it was weary.
Psalm
68:10  Your flock dwelt in it; You
provided from Your goodness for the poor, O Elohim.
Psalm
68:11  יהוה gave
the word; The women who proclaimed it was a great company:
Psalm
68:12  “Sovereigns of armies flee in
haste! And she who remains at home divides the spoil.”
Psalm
68:13  If you lie down among the
sheepfolds, The wings of a dove are covered with silver, And her feathers with
yellow gold.
Psalm
68:14  When the Almighty scattered
sovereigns in it, It did snow in Tsalmon.
Psalm
68:15  A mountain of Elohim is the
mountain of Bashan; A mountain of peaks is the mountain of Bashan.
Psalm
68:16  O mountain of peaks, why do you
gaze in envy At the mountain which Elohim desired to dwell in; יהוה
even dwells there forever.
Psalm
68:17  The chariots of Elohim are twenty
thousand, Thousands of thousands; יהוה came from Sinai
Into the Set-apart Place.
Psalm
68:18  You have ascended on high, You
have led captivity captive, You have received gifts among men, And even the
rebellious, That Yah Elohim might dwell there.
Psalm
68:19  Blessed be יהוה,
Day by day He bears our burden, The Ĕl of our deliverance! Selah.
Psalm
68:20  Our Ĕl is the Ĕl of
deliverance; And to יהוה, the Master, belong escapes
from death.
Psalm
68:21  Indeed, Elohim smites the head of
His enemies, The hairy scalp of him who walks about in His guilt.
Psalm
68:22  יהוה said,
“I bring back from Bashan, I bring back from the depths of the sea,
Psalm
68:23  “So that you plunge your foot in
blood; That the tongues of your dogs Have their portion from the enemies.”
Psalm
68:24  They have seen Your goings, O
Elohim, The goings of my Ĕl, my Sovereign, Into the set-apart place.
Psalm
68:25  The singers went in front, The
players on instruments after them; Among them were the maidens playing
tambourines.
Psalm
68:26  Bless Elohim in the assemblies, יהוה,
from the fountain of Yisra’ĕl.
Psalm
68:27  There is Binyamin, the smallest,
their ruler, The leaders of Yehuḏah, their company, The leader of Zeḇulun,
the leader of Naphtali.
Psalm
68:28  Your Elohim has commanded your
strength, be strong! O Elohim, this You have worked out for us!
Psalm
68:29  Because of Your Hĕḵal
at Yerushalayim, Sovereigns bring presents to You.
Psalm
68:30  Rebuke the wild beasts of the
reeds, The herd of bulls, with the calves of the peoples, Each one humbling
himself with pieces of silver. Scatter the peoples who delight in conflicts!
Psalm
68:31  Ambassadors come out of Mitsrayim;
Kush stretches out her hands to Elohim.
Psalm
68:32  Sing to Elohim, you reigns of the
earth, Praises to יהוה, Selah.
Psalm
68:33  To Him who rides on the ancient
highest heavens! See, He sends out His voice, a mighty voice.
Psalm
68:34  Ascribe strength to Elohim; His
excellence is over Yisra’ĕl, And His strength is in the clouds.
Psalm
68:35  O Elohim, awesome from Your
set-apart places, The Ĕl of Yisra’ĕl is He Who gives strength and
power to His people. Blessed be Elohim!
Psalm
69:1  Save me, O Elohim! For waters have
come up to my neck.
Psalm
69:2  I have sunk in deep mud, And there
is no place to stand; I have come into deep waters, And the floods overflow me.
Psalm
69:3  I am worn out from my crying; My
throat is dry; My eyes grow dim As I wait for my Elohim.
Psalm
69:4  Those who hate me without a cause
Are more than the hairs of my head; They are mighty who would destroy me, My
lying enemies; What I did not steal, I restored.
Psalm
69:5  O Elohim, You Yourself know my
foolishness; And my guilt has not been hidden from You.
Psalm
69:6  Let not those who wait for You, O
Master יהוה of hosts, Be ashamed because of me; Let not
those who seek You Be humbled because of me, O Elohim of Yisra’ĕl.
Psalm
69:7  Because I have borne reproach for
Your sake; Shame has covered my face.
Psalm
69:8  I have become a stranger to my
brothers, And a foreigner to my mother’s children;
Psalm
69:9  Because ardour for Your house has
eaten me up, And the reproaches of those who reproach You have fallen on me.
Psalm
69:10  And I wept in my being with
fasting, And it became my reproach.
Psalm
69:11  And when I put on sackcloth, I
became a proverb to them.
Psalm
69:12  They who sit in the gate talk
about me, And I am the song of the drunkards.
Psalm
69:13  But as for me, my prayer is to
You, O יהוה, At an acceptable time, O Elohim. In the
greatness of Your kindness, Answer me in the truth of Your deliverance.
Psalm
69:14  Rescue me out of the mire, And let
me not sink. Let me be rescued from those who hate me, And out of the deep
waters.
Psalm
69:15  Let not a flood of waters overflow
me, Nor let the deep swallow me up, Nor let the pit shut its mouth on me.
Psalm
69:16  Answer me, O יהוה,
for Your kindness is good. According to the greatness of Your compassion, turn
to me.
Psalm
69:17  And do not hide Your face from
Your servant, For I am in distress; Answer me speedily.
Psalm
69:18  Draw near to my being, redeem it;
Ransom me because of my enemies.
Psalm
69:19  You Yourself know my reproach, And
my shame and my confusion; My adversaries are all before You.
Psalm
69:20  Reproach has broken my heart and I
am sick; I looked for sympathy, but there was none; And for comforters, but I
found none.
Psalm
69:21  And they gave me gall for my food,
And for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.
Psalm
69:22  Let their table before them become
a snare, And a trap to those at ease.
Psalm
69:23  Let their eyes be darkened, so as
not to see; And make their loins shake continually.
Psalm
69:24  Pour out Your wrath upon them, And
let Your burning displeasure overtake them.
Psalm
69:25  Let their encampments be deserted;
Let no one dwell in their tents.
Psalm
69:26  For they persecute him whom You
have smitten, And talk about the pain of those You have wounded.
Psalm
69:27  Add crookedness to their
crookedness, And let them not enter into Your righteousness.
Psalm
69:28  Let them be blotted out of the
book of the living, And not be written with the righteous.
Psalm
69:29  But I am poor and in pain; Let
Your deliverance, O Elohim, set me up on high.
Psalm
69:30  I praise the Name of Elohim with a
song, And I make Him great with thanksgiving.
Psalm
69:31  And this pleases יהוה
more than an ox, A bull with horns and
hooves.
Psalm
69:32  The humble shall see, they
rejoice, You who seek Elohim, and your hearts live.
Psalm
69:33  For יהוה
hears the poor, And He shall not despise His captives.
Psalm
69:34  Let the heavens and earth praise
Him, The seas and all that moves in them.
Psalm
69:35  For Elohim shall save Tsiyon And
build the cities of Yehuḏah. And they shall dwell there and possess it,
Psalm
69:36  And the seed of His servants
inherit it, And those who love His Name dwell in it.
Psalm
70:1  O Elohim, deliver me! Hasten to my
help, O יהוה !
Psalm
70:2  Let those who seek my life Be
ashamed and abashed, Let those who are desiring my evil Be turned back and
humiliated.
Psalm
70:3  Let those who say, “Aha, aha!” Be
turned back because of their shame.
Psalm
70:4  Let all those who seek You Rejoice
and be glad in You; And let those who love Your deliverance always say, “Let
Elohim be made great!”
Psalm
70:5  But I am poor and needy; Hasten to
me, O Elohim! You are my help and my deliverer; O יהוה,
do not delay.
Psalm
71:1  In You, O יהוה,
I have taken refuge; Let me never be ashamed.
Psalm
71:2  In Your righteousness deliver and
rescue me; Incline Your ear to me, and save me.
Psalm
71:3  Be to me a rock to dwell in, To go
into continually. You have given the command to save me, For You are my rock
and my stronghold.
Psalm
71:4  Rescue me, O my Elohim, Out of the
hand of the wrong, Out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel.
Psalm
71:5  For You are my expectation, Master יהוה,
my Trust from my youth.
Psalm
71:6  Upon You I have leaned from my
birth; You took me out of my mother’s womb. My praise is continually of You.
Psalm
71:7  I have become as a wonder to many,
But You are my strong refuge.
Psalm
71:8  My mouth is filled with Your praise, Your splendour, all
the day.
Psalm
71:9  Do not cast me off in the time of
old age, When my strength fails, do not forsake me.
Psalm
71:10  For my enemies have spoken against
me. And those who watch for my life Have taken counsel together,
Psalm
71:11  Saying, “Elohim has forsaken him;
Pursue and take him, for there is no one to deliver.”
Psalm
71:12  O Elohim, do not be far from me;
My Elohim, hasten to my help!
Psalm
71:13  Let those who are adversaries of
my life Be ashamed, consumed, Let those who seek my evil Be covered with
reproach and confusion.
Psalm
71:14  But I continually wait, And shall
praise You more and more.
Psalm
71:15  My mouth recounts Your
righteousness Your deliverance all the day, Though I do not know their numbers.
Psalm
71:16  I come in the might of the Master יהוה
; I make mention of Your righteousness, Yours alone.
Psalm
71:17  Elohim, You have taught me from my
youth; And to this day I declare Your wonders.
Psalm
71:18  And also when I am old and grey, O
Elohim, do not forsake me, Until I declare Your strength to a generation, Your
might to all those who are to come.
Psalm
71:19  For Your righteousness, O Elohim,
is most high, You who have done great deeds.
O Elohim, who is like You?
Psalm
71:20  You who have shown me great and
evil distresses, Revive me again and bring me up again From the depths of the
earth.
Psalm
71:21  You increase my greatness, And
comfort me on every side.
Psalm
71:22  Also with the lyre I praise You
For Your trustworthiness, O my Elohim! I sing to You with the lyre, O Set-apart
One of Yisra’ĕl.
Psalm
71:23  My lips shout for joy when I sing
to You, Even my being, which You have redeemed.
Psalm
71:24  My tongue, too, utters Your
righteousness all day long; For those who have been seeking my evil Have been
put to shame, Have become abashed.
Psalm
72:1  O Elohim, give the sovereign Your
right-rulings, And Your righteousness to the Son of a sovereign.
Psalm
72:2  Let Him rule Your people with
righteousness, And Your poor with right-ruling.
Psalm
72:3  Let the mountains bring peace to
the people, And the hills, by righteousness.
Psalm
72:4  Let Him rightly rule the poor of
the people, Save the children of the needy, And crush the oppressor.
Psalm
72:5  Let them fear You with the sun, shining And before the moon, in all
generations.
Psalm
72:6  Let Him come down like rain upon
the mown grass, Like showers, watering the earth.
Psalm
72:7  Let the righteous flourish in His
days, With plenty of peace, Till the moon is no more.
Psalm
72:8  And let Him rule from sea to sea,
And from the River to the ends of the earth.
Psalm
72:9  Let those dwelling in the desert
bow before Him, And His enemies lick the dust.
Psalm
72:10  Let the sovereigns of Tarshish and
of the isles bring presents; The sovereigns of Sheḇa and Seḇa offer
gifts.
Psalm
72:11  And let all sovereigns bow down
before Him, All nations serve Him.
Psalm
72:12  For He delivers the needy when he
cries, And the poor, who has no helper.
Psalm
72:13  He spares the poor and needy, And
He saves the lives of the needy.
Psalm
72:14  He redeems their life from
oppression and from violence; And their blood is precious in His eyes.
Psalm
72:15  And He shall live, And the gold of
Sheḇa be given to Him, And prayer be made for Him continually; Let Him be
blessed all day long.
Psalm
72:16  Let there be plenty of grain in
the earth, On the top of the mountains, Let its fruit wave like Leḇanon,
And those of the city flourish like grass of the earth.
Psalm
72:17  Let His Name be forever, His Name
continue before the sun; And let them bless themselves in Him; Let all nations
call Him blessed.
Psalm
72:18  Blessed be יהוה
Elohim, Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, He alone is doing wonders!
Psalm
72:19  And blessed be His esteemed Name
forever! And let all the earth Be filled with His esteem. Amĕn and Amĕn.
Psalm
72:20  The prayers of Dawiḏ the son
of Yishai are ended. 
Psalm
73:1  Elohim is truly good to Yisra’ĕl,
To those whose heart is clean.
Psalm
73:2  But as for me, my feet had almost
stumbled, My steps had nearly slipped.
Psalm
73:3  For I was envious of the boasters,
When I saw the peace of the wrong-doers.
Psalm
73:4  For death has no pangs for them,
And their strength is firm.
Psalm
73:5  They are not in trouble as other
men, And they are not plagued like other men.
Psalm
73:6  So pride is their necklace, The
garment of violence covers them.
Psalm
73:7  Their eyes bulge from fatness;
Their heart overflows with imaginations.
Psalm
73:8  They mock and speak in the evil of
oppression; They speak loftily.
Psalm
73:9  They have set their mouth against
the heavens, And their tongue walks through the earth, saying:
Psalm
73:10  “Therefore His people return here,
And waters of a filled cup are
drained by them!”
Psalm
73:11  And they have said, “How could Ĕl
know? And is there knowledge in the Most High?”
Psalm
73:12  See, these are the wrong, And
always at ease, They have amassed wealth!
Psalm
73:13  Indeed, in vain have I cleansed my
heart, And washed my hands in innocence.
Psalm
73:14  For I am plagued all day long, And
my reproof is every morning.
Psalm
73:15  If I had said, “Let me speak thus,”
See, I would have deceived A generation of Your children.
Psalm
73:16  Yet, when I tried to understand
this, It was labour to my eyes –
Psalm
73:17  Until I went into the set-apart
place of Ĕl; Then I perceived
their end.
Psalm
73:18  Indeed, You set them in slippery
places; You make them fall to ruins.
Psalm
73:19  How suddenly they are ruined!
Completely swept away through destructions.
Psalm
73:20  יהוה, when
You awake You despise their image, As one does a dream after waking.
Psalm
73:21  For my heart was in a ferment, And
I was pierced in my kidneys.
Psalm
73:22  I was stupid and ignorant, I was
like a beast toward You.
Psalm
73:23  Yet I am always with You, You took
hold of my right hand.
Psalm
73:24  You lead me by Your counsel, And
afterward receive me unto esteem.
Psalm
73:25  Whom do I have in the heavens? And
I have desired no one besides You on earth.
Psalm
73:26  My flesh and my heart shall waste
away, But Elohim is the rock of my
heart And my portion forever.
Psalm
73:27  For look, those who are far from
You perish; You shall cut off all those Who go whoring away from You.
Psalm
73:28  But as for me, it is good to be
near Elohim. I have made my refuge in the Master יהוה,
To declare all Your works.
Psalm
74:1  O Elohim, why do You forever reject
us? Why does Your displeasure smoke Against the sheep of Your pasture?
Psalm
74:2  Remember Your congregation. You did
purchase of old, The tribe of Your inheritance. You did redeem, This Mount
Tsiyon where You have dwelt.
Psalm
74:3  Lift up Your steps to the endless
ruins; The enemy has done all evil in the set-apart place.
Psalm
74:4  Your adversaries have roared In the
midst of Your meeting places; They have set up their own signs as signs.
Psalm
74:5  It seems as if one had lifted up
Axes among the thick trees.
Psalm
74:6  And now all its carved work, They
have broken down with axe and hammer.
Psalm
74:7  They have set fire to Your
set-apart place, They have profaned the dwelling place of Your Name to the
ground.
Psalm
74:8  They said in their hearts, “Let us
suppress them altogether.” They burned all the meeting places of Ĕl in the
land.
Psalm
74:9  We do not see our signs, There is
no longer a prophet, Nor any among us who knows how long.
Psalm
74:10  O Elohim, how long would the
adversary reproach? Would the enemy despise Your Name forever?
Psalm
74:11  Why do You hold back Your hand,
even Your right hand? From the midst of Your bosom – end it!
Psalm
74:12  For Elohim is my Sovereign from of
old, Working deliverance in the midst of the earth.
Psalm
74:13  You divided the sea by Your might;
You broke the heads of the sea serpents in the waters.
Psalm
74:14  You broke the heads of Liwiathan
in pieces, You made him food for the people Living in the wilderness.
Psalm
74:15  You did cleave open the fountain
and the flood, You did dry up mighty rivers.
Psalm
74:16  The day is Yours, the night is
Yours too, You have established the light and the sun.
Psalm
74:17  You have set all the borders of
the earth, You have made summer and winter.
Psalm
74:18  Remember this: the enemy has
reproached יהוה, And a foolish people has despised Your
Name.
Psalm
74:19  Do not give the being of Your
turtledove to the wild beast! Do not forget the life of Your afflicted ones
forever.
Psalm
74:20  Look to the covenant, For the dark
places of the earth are filled With haunts of violence.
Psalm
74:21  Let not the crushed one return
ashamed! Let the poor and needy praise Your Name.
Psalm
74:22  Arise, O Elohim, plead Your own
cause, Remember how the foolish man reproaches You daily.
Psalm
74:23  Do not forget the voice of Your
enemies, The uproar of those rising up against You increases continually.
Psalm
75:1  We shall give thanks to You, O
Elohim, we shall give thanks! And Your Name is near! Your wonders shall be
declared!
Psalm
75:2  “When I seize the appointed time,
It is I who judge in uprightness.
Psalm
75:3  “The earth and all its inhabitants
are melted; It is I who set its columns firm. Selah.
Psalm
75:4  “I said to the boasters, ‘Do not
boast,’ And to the wrong, ‘Do not lift up the horn.
Psalm
75:5  “Do not lift up your horn on high
(You speak with a stiff neck).’ ”
Psalm
75:6  For exaltations are neither from
the east, Nor from the west nor from the wilderness.
Psalm
75:7  But Elohim is the Judge – He puts
down one, And exalts another.
Psalm
75:8  For a cup is in the hand of יהוה,
And the wine shall foam; It is filled with a mixture, And He pours it out. All
the wrong of the earth drink, Draining it to the dregs.
Psalm
75:9  But I, I declare forever, I sing
praises to the Elohim of Ya‛aqoḇ.
Psalm
75:10  “And all the horns of the wrong I
cut off; The horns of the righteous are lifted up.”
Psalm
76:1  In Yehuḏah Elohim is known;
His Name is great in Yisra’ĕl.
Psalm
76:2  And His booth is in Shalĕm,
Psalm
76:3  There He broke the arrows of the
bow, The shield and the sword and the battle-axe. Selah.
Psalm
76:4  You are resplendent, More excellent
than mountains of prey.
Psalm
76:5  The stout-hearted have been
stripped; They slept their sleep; And none of the mighty men have found their
hands.
Psalm
76:6  At Your rebuke, O Elohim of Ya‛aqoḇ,
Both the rider and horse lay stunned.
Psalm
76:7  You, You are to be feared; And who
would stand in Your presence When You are displeased?
Psalm
76:8  From heaven You shall cause
judgment to be heard; The earth shall fear, and shall be still,
Psalm
76:9  When Elohim arises to right-ruling,
To save all the meek of the earth. Selah.
Psalm
76:10  For the wrath of mankind praises
You, With the remainder of wrath You gird Yourself!
Psalm
76:11  Make vows to יהוה
your Elohim, and pay them. Let all who are around Him bring presents To the One
to be feared.
Psalm
76:12  He cuts off the spirit of leaders,
He is awesome to the sovereigns of the earth!
Psalm
77:1  My voice is to Elohim, and I cry;
My voice is to Elohim, and He listened to me.
Psalm
77:2  In the day of my distress I sought יהוה
; My hand was stretched out in the night And it did not cease, My being refused
to be comforted.
Psalm
77:3  I remembered Elohim, and groaned; I
complained, and my spirit grew faint. Selah.
Psalm
77:4  You ceased the watches of my eyes,
I was too troubled to speak.
Psalm
77:5  I have thought about the days of
old, The years long past.
Psalm
77:6  I remember my song in the night, I
meditate within my heart, And my spirit searches diligently.
Psalm
77:7  Would יהוה
reject forever, And never again be pleased?
Psalm
77:8  Has His kindness ceased forever,
Has the promise failed for all generations?
Psalm
77:9  Has Ĕl forgotten to show
favour? Has He shut up His compassions in displeasure? Selah.
Psalm
77:10  And I said, “This is my grief:
That the right hand of the Most High has changed.”
Psalm
77:11  I remember the deeds of Yah, For I
remember Your wonders of old.
Psalm
77:12  And I shall meditate on all Your
work, And talk of Your deeds.
Psalm
77:13  Your way, O Elohim, is in
Set-apartness; Who is a great Ĕl like Elohim?
Psalm
77:14  You are the Ĕl who does
wonders; You have made known Your strength among the peoples.
Psalm
77:15  By Your arm You have redeemed Your
people, The sons of Ya‛aqoḇ and Yosĕph. Selah.
Psalm
77:16  The waters saw You, O Elohim; The
waters saw You, they were afraid; The depths also trembled.
Psalm
77:17  The clouds poured out water; The
heavens rumbled; Also, Your arrows flashed back and forth.
Psalm
77:18  The voice of Your thunder rolled
along; Lightnings lit up the world; The earth trembled and shook.
Psalm
77:19  Your way was in the sea, And Your
path in the great waters, And Your footsteps were not known.
Psalm
77:20  You did lead Your people like a
flock By the hand of Mosheh and Aharon.
Psalm
78:1  My people, give ear to my Torah,
Incline your ears to the words of my mouth.
Psalm
78:2  I open my mouth in a parable; I
utter riddles of old,
Psalm
78:3  Which we have heard and known, For
our fathers have related them to us.
Psalm
78:4  We do not hide them from their children, Relating to the generation to come the
praises of יהוה, And His strength and His wonders which
He has done.
Psalm
78:5  For He raised a witness in Ya‛aqoḇ,
And set a Torah in Yisra’ĕl, Which He commanded our fathers, To teach them
to their children;
Psalm
78:6  That it might be known to a
generation to come, To children who would be born, To rise up and relate them to their children,
Psalm
78:7  And place their trust in Elohim,
And not forget the works of Ĕl, But watch over His commands,
Psalm
78:8  And not be like their fathers, A
stubborn and rebellious generation, A generation which did not prepare its
heart, Whose spirit was not steadfast to Ĕl.
Psalm
78:9  The children of Ephrayim, armed
bowmen, Turned back in the day of battle.
Psalm
78:10  They did not guard the covenant of
Elohim, And they refused to walk in His Torah,
Psalm
78:11  And they forgot His deeds And His
wonders which He had shown them.
Psalm
78:12  He did wonders in the sight of
their fathers, In the land of Mitsrayim, in the field of Tso‛an.
Psalm
78:13  He split the sea and caused them
to pass through, And He made the waters stand up like a heap,
Psalm
78:14  And led them with the cloud by
day, And all the night with a light of fire.
Psalm
78:15  He split the rocks in the
wilderness, And made them drink, as from the great depths,
Psalm
78:16  And brought forth streams from the
rock, And caused waters to come down as rivers.
Psalm
78:17  Yet they sinned still more against
Him To rebel against the Most High in the desert.
Psalm
78:18  And they tried Ĕl in their
heart By asking food according to their desire.
Psalm
78:19  And they spoke against Elohim.
They said, “Is Ĕl able to set a table in the wilderness?
Psalm
78:20  “Look, He struck the rock, So that
the waters gushed out, And the streams overflowed. Is He able to give bread
also? Would He provide meat for His people?”
Psalm
78:21  Therefore יהוה
heard, and He was wroth; So a fire was kindled against Ya‛aqoḇ, And
displeasure also came up against Yisra’ĕl,
Psalm
78:22  Because they did not believe in
Elohim, Neither did they trust in His deliverance.
Psalm
78:23  Yet He had commanded the clouds
above, And opened the doors of the heavens,
Psalm
78:24  And He rained down manna on them
to eat, And He gave them the grain of the heavens.
Psalm
78:25  Men ate bread of the mighty; He
sent them provisions to satisfaction.
Psalm
78:26  He made an east wind blow in the
heavens; And by His power He brought in the south wind.
Psalm
78:27  And He rained meat on them like
the dust, And winged birds like the sand of the seas,
Psalm
78:28  And let them fall in the midst of
His camp, All around His Dwelling Place.
Psalm
78:29  So they ate and were completely
satisfied, For He brought them what they desired.
Psalm
78:30  They had not turned away from
their desire, Their food was still in their mouths,
Psalm
78:31  When the wrath of Elohim came
against them, And He slew among their fat ones, And He struck down the choice
ones of Yisra’ĕl.
Psalm
78:32  In spite of all this they still
sinned, And did not believe in His wonders.
Psalm
78:33  So He ended their days in a
breath, And their years in trouble.
Psalm
78:34  When He slew them, then they
sought Him, And they returned and did earnestly seek Ĕl.
Psalm
78:35  And they remembered that Elohim
was their rock, And the Most High Ĕl their redeemer.
Psalm
78:36  But they flattered Him with their
mouth, And they lied to Him with their tongue,
Psalm
78:37  For their heart was not steadfast
with Him, And they were not true to His covenant.
Psalm
78:38  But He, the Compassionate One,
Pardoned crookedness, And did not destroy them. And many a time He turned His
displeasure away, And did not stir up all His wrath.
Psalm
78:39  For He remembered that they were
but flesh, A passing breath that does not return.
Psalm
78:40  How often they rebelled against
Him in the wilderness, And grieved Him in the desert!
Psalm
78:41  And again and again they tried Ĕl,
And provoked the Set-apart One of Yisra’ĕl.
Psalm
78:42  They did not remember His hand,
The day when He redeemed them from the adversary,
Psalm
78:43  How He worked His signs in
Mitsrayim, And His wonders in the field of Tso‛an.
Psalm
78:44  He turned their rivers into blood,
And they could not drink their streams.
Psalm
78:45  He sent among them swarms of flies
which devoured them, And frogs which destroyed them,
Psalm
78:46  And gave their crops to the
caterpillar, And their labour to the locust.
Psalm
78:47  He destroyed their vines with
hail, And their sycamore trees with frost,
Psalm
78:48  And gave their beasts over to the
hail, And their livestock to bolts of fire.
Psalm
78:49  He sent on them the burning of His
displeasure, Wrath, and rage, and distress, A deputation of messengers of
evils.
Psalm
78:50  He made a path for His
displeasure; He did not spare their being from death, But gave their life over
to the plague.
Psalm
78:51  And He smote all the first-born in
Mitsrayim, The first-fruits of strength in the tents of Ḥam,
Psalm
78:52  Then made His own people go forth
like sheep, And led them in the wilderness like a flock.
Psalm
78:53  And He led them on safely, And
they did not fear, But the sea covered their enemies.
Psalm
78:54  And He brought them to the border of
His set-apart place, This mountain which His right hand had gained,
Psalm
78:55  And drove out nations before them,
And allotted them a measured inheritance, And made the tribes of Yisra’ĕl
dwell in their tents.
Psalm
78:56  Yet they tried and rebelled Against
the Most High Elohim, And did not guard His witnesses,
