Dani’ĕl/Daniel
Dan
1:1  In the third year of the reign of
Yehoyaqim, sovereign of Yehuḏah, Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar,
sovereign of Baḇel came to Yerushalayim and besieged it. 
Dan
1:2  And יהוה
gave Yehoyaqim sovereign of Yehuḏah into his hand, with some of the
utensils of the House of Elohim, which he brought to the land of Shin‛ar
to the house of his mighty one. And he brought the utensils into the treasure
house of his mighty one. 
Dan
1:3  And the sovereign said to Ashpenaz,
the chief of his eunuchs, to bring some of the children of Yisra’ĕl and
some of the sovereign’s descendants and some of the nobles, 
Dan
1:4  young men in whom there was no
blemish, but good-looking, having insight in all wisdom, having knowledge and
understanding learning, capable to stand in the sovereign’s palace, and to
teach them the writing and speech of the Chaldeans. 
Dan
1:5  And the sovereign appointed for them
a daily ration of the sovereign’s food and of the wine which he drank, and
three years of training for them, so that at the end thereof they should stand
before the sovereign. 
Dan
1:6  Now among them were from the sons of
Yehuḏah: Dani’ĕl, Ḥananyah, Misha’ĕl, and Azaryah. 
Dan
1:7  And the chief of the eunuchs gave
them names. For he called Dani’ĕl, Bĕlteshatstsar; and Ḥananyah,
Shaḏraḵ; and Misha’ĕl, Mĕyshaḵ; and Azaryah, Aḇĕḏ-Neḡo.

Dan
1:8  But Dani’ĕl laid it upon his
heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the sovereign’s
food, nor with the wine which he drank. So he asked permission from the chief of the eunuchs not to defile himself. 
Dan
1:9  And Elohim granted Dani’ĕl
kindness and compassion from the chief of the eunuchs, 
Dan
1:10  but the chief of the eunuchs said
to Dani’ĕl, “I fear my master the sovereign, who has appointed your food
and drink. For why should he see your faces looking worse than the young men
who are your age? Then you would make my head guilty before the sovereign!” 
Dan
1:11  And Dani’ĕl said to the
overseer whom the chief of the eunuchs had set over Dani’ĕl, Ḥananyah,
Misha’ĕl, and Azaryah, 
Dan
1:12  “Please try your servants for ten
days, and let them give us vegetables to eat and water to drink. 
Dan
1:13  “Then let our appearances be
examined before you, and the appearances of the young men who eat the portion
of the sovereign’s food. And do with your servants as you see fit.” 
Dan
1:14  And he listened to them in this
matter, and tried them ten days. 
Dan
1:15  And at the end of ten days their
appearances looked better and fatter in flesh than all the young men who ate
the portion of the sovereign’s food. 
Dan
1:16  And it came to be that the overseer
took away their portion of food and the wine they were to drink, and gave them
vegetables. 
Dan
1:17  As for these four young men, Elohim
gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom. And Dani’ĕl had
understanding in all visions and dreams. 
Dan
1:18  And at the end of the days, when
the sovereign had said that they should be brought in, the chief of the eunuchs
brought them in before Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar. 
Dan
1:19  And the sovereign spoke with them,
and none among them all were found like Dani’ĕl, Ḥananyah, Misha’ĕl,
and Azaryah, so they stood before the sovereign. 
Dan
1:20  And in any word of wisdom and
understanding about which the sovereign examined them, he found them ten times
better than all the magicians, the astrologers, who were in all his reign. 
Dan
1:21  And Dani’ĕl continued until
the first year of Sovereign Koresh. 
Dan
2:1  And in the second year of the reign
of Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar, Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar had
dreams. And his spirit was so troubled that his sleep left him. 
Dan
2:2  And the sovereign gave orders to
call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the practisers of witchcraft, and
the Chaldeans to declare to the sovereign his dreams. So they came and stood
before the sovereign. 
Dan
2:3  And the sovereign said to them, “I
have had a dream, and my spirit is troubled to know the dream.” 
Dan
2:4  And the Chaldeans spoke to the
sovereign in Aramaic, “O sovereign, live forever! Relate the dream to your
servants, and we shall reveal the interpretation.” 
Dan
2:5  The sovereign answered and said to
the Chaldeans, “My decision is firm: if you do not make known the dream and its
interpretation to me, your limbs shall be taken from you, and your houses made
dunghills. 
Dan
2:6  “But if you reveal the dream and its
interpretation, you shall receive gifts, and rewards, and great esteem from me.
So reveal to me the dream and its interpretation.” 
Dan
2:7  They answered again and said, “Let
the sovereign relate to his servants the dream, and we shall reveal its
interpretation.” 
Dan
2:8  The sovereign answered and said, “I
know for certain that you would gain time, because you see that my decision is
firm: 
Dan
2:9  “If you do not make known the dream
to me, there is only one decree for you! For you have agreed to speak lying and
corrupt words before me till the time has changed. So relate the dream to me,
then I shall know that you shall reveal its interpretation for me.” 
Dan
2:10  The Chaldeans answered the
sovereign, and said, “There is no one on earth who is able to reveal the matter
of the sovereign. Because no sovereign, master, or ruler has ever asked a
matter like this of any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean. 
Dan
2:11  “And the matter that the sovereign
is asking is difficult, and there is no other who is able to reveal it to the
sovereign except the elahin, whose dwelling is not with flesh.” 
Dan
2:12  Because of this the sovereign was
enraged and very wroth, and gave orders to destroy all the wise ones of Baḇel.

Dan
2:13  So the decree went out, and they
began killing the wise ones. And they sought Dani’ĕl and his companions,
to kill them. 
Dan
2:14  Then with counsel and wisdom Dani’ĕl
answered Aryoḵ, the chief of the sovereign’s guard, who had gone out to
kill the wise ones of Baḇel – 
Dan
2:15  he answered and said to Aryoḵ
the sovereign’s officer, “Why is the decree from the sovereign so urgent?” So
Aryoḵ made the decision known to Dani’ĕl. 
Dan
2:16  And Dani’ĕl went in and asked
the sovereign to give him time, and he would show the sovereign the
interpretation. 
Dan
2:17  Then Dani’ĕl went to his
house, and made the decision known to Ḥananyah, Misha’ĕl, and
Azaryah, his companions, 
Dan
2:18  to seek compassion from the Elah of
the heavens concerning this secret, so that Dani’ĕl and his companions
should not perish with the rest of the wise ones of Baḇel. 
Dan
2:19  Then the secret was revealed to
Dani’ĕl in a night vision, and Dani’ĕl blessed the Elah of the
heavens. 
Dan
2:20  Dani’ĕl responded and said, “Blessed
be the Name of Elah forever and ever, for wisdom and might are His. 
Dan
2:21  “And He changes the times and the
seasons. He removes sovereigns and raises up sovereigns. He gives wisdom to the
wise and knowledge to those who possess understanding. 
Dan
2:22  “He reveals deep and secret
matters. He knows what is in the darkness, and light dwells with Him. 
Dan
2:23  “I thank You and praise You, O Elah
of my fathers. You have given me wisdom and might, and have now made known to
me what we asked of You, for You have made known to us the sovereign’s matter.”

Dan
2:24  So Dani’ĕl went to Aryoḵ,
whom the sovereign had appointed to destroy the wise ones of Baḇel. He
went and said this to him, “Do not destroy the wise ones of Baḇel. Bring
me in before the sovereign, and I shall show the interpretation to the
sovereign.” 
Dan
2:25  Then Aryoḵ brought Dani’ĕl
in a hurry before the sovereign, and said thus to him, “I have found a man
among the sons of the exile of Yehuḏah, who does make known to the
sovereign the interpretation.” 
Dan
2:26  The sovereign answered and said to
Dani’ĕl, whose name was Bĕlteshatstsar, “Are you able to make known
to me the dream which I have seen, and its interpretation?” 
Dan
2:27  Dani’ĕl answered before the
sovereign, and said, “The secret which the sovereign is asking – the wise ones,
the astrologers, the magicians, and the diviners are unable to show it to the
sovereign. 
Dan
2:28  “But there is an Elah in the
heavens who reveals secrets, and He has made known to Sovereign Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar
what is to be in the latter days. Your dream, and the visions of your head upon
your bed, were these: 
Dan
2:29  “As for you, O sovereign, on your
bed your thoughts came up: What is going to take place after this. And He who
reveals secrets has made known to you what shall be after this. 
Dan
2:30  “As for me, this secret has not
been revealed to me because I have more wisdom than anyone living, but for our
sakes who make known the interpretation to the sovereign, and that you should
know the thoughts of your heart. 
Dan
2:31  “You, O sovereign, were looking on,
and saw a great image! This great image, and its brightness excellent, was
standing before you, and its form was awesome. 
Dan
2:32  “This image’s head was of fine
gold, its chest and arms of silver, its belly and thighs of bronze, 
Dan
2:33  its legs of iron, its feet partly
of iron and partly of clay. 
Dan
2:34  “You were looking on, until a stone
was cut out without hands, and it smote the image on its feet of iron and clay,
and broke them in pieces. 
Dan
2:35  “Then the iron, the clay, the
bronze, the silver, and the gold were crushed together, and became like chaff
from the summer threshing-floors. And the wind took them away so that no trace
of them was found. And the stone that smote the image became a great mountain
and filled all the earth. 
Dan
2:36  “This is the dream, and its
interpretation we declare before the sovereign. 
Dan
2:37  “You, O sovereign, are a sovereign
of sovereigns. For the Elah of the heavens has given you a reign, power, and
strength, and preciousness, 
Dan
2:38  and wherever the children of men
dwell, or the beasts of the field and the birds of the heavens, He has given
them into your hand, and has made you ruler over them all. You are the head of
gold. 
Dan
2:39  “And after you rises up another
reign lower than yours, and another third reign of bronze that rules over all
the earth. 
Dan
2:40  “And the fourth reign is as strong
as iron, because iron crushes and shatters all. So, like iron that breaks in
pieces, it crushes and breaks all these. 
Dan
2:41  “Yet, as you saw the feet and toes,
partly of potter’s clay and partly of iron, the reign is to be divided. But
some of the strength of the iron is to be in it, because you saw the iron mixed
with muddy clay. 
Dan
2:42  “And as the toes of the feet were
partly of iron and partly of clay, so the reign is partly strong and partly
brittle. 
Dan
2:43  “And as you saw iron mixed with
muddy clay, they are mixing themselves with the seed of men, but they are not
clinging to each other, even as iron does not mix with clay. 
Dan
2:44  “And in the days of these
sovereigns the Elah of the heavens shall set up a reign which shall never be
destroyed, nor the reign pass on to other people – it crushes and puts to an
end all these reigns, and it shall stand forever.
Dan
2:45  “Because you saw that the stone was
cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it crushed the iron, the
bronze, the clay, the silver, and the gold, the great Elah has made known to
the sovereign what shall be after this. And the dream is true, and its
interpretation is trustworthy.” 
Dan
2:46  Then Sovereign Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar
fell on his face, and did obeisance before Dani’ĕl, and gave orders to
present to him an offering and incense. 
Dan
2:47  The sovereign answered Dani’ĕl,
and said, “Truly your Elah is the Elah of elahin, the Master of sovereigns, and
a revealer of secrets, since you were able to reveal this secret.” 
Dan
2:48  Then the sovereign made Dani’ĕl
great and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over all the province
of Baḇel, and chief of the nobles, over all the wise ones of Baḇel.

Dan
2:49  And Dani’ĕl asked of the
sovereign, and he set Shaḏraḵ, Mĕyshaḵ, and Aḇĕḏ-Neḡo
over the work of the province of Baḇel, and Dani’ĕl in the gate of
the sovereign. 
Dan
3:1  Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar
the sovereign made an image of gold, whose height was sixty cubits and its
width six cubits. He set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Baḇel.

Dan
3:2  And Sovereign Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar
sent word to gather together the viceroys, the nobles, and the governors, the
counsellors, the treasurers, the judges, the magistrates, and all the officials
of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Sovereign Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar
had set up. 
Dan
3:3  Then the viceroys, the nobles, and
the governors, the counsellors, the treasurers, the judges, the magistrates,
and all the officials of the provinces gathered together for the dedication of
the image that Sovereign Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar had set up. And they
stood before the image that Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar had set up. 
Dan
3:4  Then a herald loudly proclaimed, “To
you it is commanded, O peoples, nations, and languages, 
Dan
3:5  that as soon as you hear the sound
of the horn, the flute, the zither, the lyre, the harp, the pipes, and all
kinds of instruments, you shall fall down and do obeisance to the gold image
that Sovereign Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar has set up. 
Dan
3:6  “And whoever does not fall down and
do obeisance is immediately thrown into the midst of a burning furnace of fire.”

Dan
3:7  So as soon as all the people heard
the sound of the horn, the flute, the zither, the lyre, the harp, all kinds of
instruments, all the people, nations, and languages fell down and did obeisance
to the gold image that Sovereign Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar had set up. 
Dan
3:8  Thereupon, at that time, certain
Chaldeans came forward and accused the Yehuḏim. 
Dan
3:9  They spoke and said to Sovereign Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar,
“O sovereign, live forever! 
Dan
3:10  “You, O sovereign, have made a
decree that everyone who hears the sound of the horn, the flute, the zither,
the lyre, the harp, the pipes, and all kinds of instruments, shall fall down
and do obeisance to the gold image, 
Dan
3:11  and whoever does not fall down and
do obeisance is thrown into the midst of a burning furnace of fire. 
Dan
3:12  “There are certain Yehuḏim
whom you have set over the work of the province of Baḇel: Shaḏraḵ,
Mĕyshaḵ, and Aḇĕḏ-Neḡo. These men, O
sovereign, pay no heed to you. They do not serve your elahin, and they are not
doing obeisance to the gold image which you have set up.” 
Dan
3:13  Then Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar,
in rage and wrath, gave orders to bring Shaḏraḵ, Mĕyshaḵ,
and Aḇĕḏ-Neḡo. Then they brought these men before the
sovereign. 
Dan
3:14  Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar
spoke and said to them, “Is it true, Shaḏraḵ, Mĕyshaḵ,
and Aḇĕḏ-Neḡo, that you do not serve my elahin, and you
do not do obeisance to the gold image which I have set up? 
Dan
3:15  “Now if you are ready when you hear
the sound of the horn, the flute, the zither, the lyre, the harp, the pipes,
and all kinds of instruments, and you fall down and do obeisance to the image
which I have made, good! But if you do not do obeisance, you are immediately
thrown into the midst of a burning furnace of fire. And who is the elah who
does deliver you from my hands?” 
Dan
3:16  Shaḏraḵ, Mĕyshaḵ,
and Aḇĕḏ-Neḡo answered and said to the sovereign, “O Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar,
we have no need to answer you in this matter. 
Dan
3:17  “For if so, our Elah whom we serve
is able to deliver us from the burning furnace of fire and from your hand, O
sovereign – He does deliver! 
Dan
3:18  “But if not, let it be known to
you, O sovereign, that we do not serve your elahin, nor do we do obeisance to
the gold image which you have set up.” 
Dan
3:19  Then Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar
was filled with wrath, and the expression on his face changed toward Shaḏraḵ,
Mĕyshaḵ, and Aḇĕḏ-Neḡo. He responded and gave
orders that they heat the furnace seven times more than it was usual to heat
it. 
Dan
3:20  And he commanded some of the
strongest men of his army to bind Shaḏraḵ, Mĕyshaḵ, and
Aḇĕḏ-Neḡo, and throw them into the burning furnace of
fire. 
Dan
3:21  So these men were bound in their
coats, their trousers, and their turbans, and their other garments, and were
thrown into the midst of the burning furnace of fire. 
Dan
3:22  Thereupon, because the sovereign’s
order was urgent, and the furnace exceedingly hot, the flame of the fire killed
those men who took up Shaḏraḵ, Mĕyshaḵ, and Aḇĕḏ-Neḡo.

Dan
3:23  And these three men, Shaḏraḵ,
Mĕyshaḵ, and Aḇĕḏ-Neḡo, fell down bound into
the midst of the burning furnace of fire. 
Dan
3:24  Then Sovereign Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar
was amazed, and stood up in haste and spoke and said to his counsellors, “Did
we not throw three men bound into the midst of the fire?” They answered and
said to the sovereign, “Certainly, O sovereign.” 
Dan
3:25  He answered and said, “Look! I see
four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire. And they are not hurt, and
the form of the fourth is like the Son of Elah.” 
Dan
3:26  Then Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar
went near the mouth of the burning furnace of fire. He spoke and said, “Shaḏraḵ,
Mĕyshaḵ, and Aḇĕḏ-Neḡo, servants of the Most
High Elah, come out, and come here.” Then Shaḏraḵ, Mĕyshaḵ,
and Aḇĕḏ-Neḡo came from the midst of the fire. 
Dan
3:27  And the viceroys, the nobles, and
the governors, and the sovereign’s counsellors gathered together, seeing these
men on whose bodies the fire had no power, and the hair of their head was not
singed nor were their garments changed, nor did the smell of fire come on them.

Dan
3:28  Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar
responded and said, “Blessed be the Elah of Shaḏraḵ, Mĕyshaḵ,
and Aḇĕḏ-Neḡo, who sent His Messenger and delivered His
servants who trusted in Him, and changed the sovereign’s order, and gave up
their bodies, that they should not serve nor do obeisance to any elah except
their own Elah! 
Dan
3:29  “Therefore I make a decree that
whoever of any people, nation, or language who speaks any wrong against the
Elah of Shaḏraḵ, Mĕyshaḵ, and Aḇĕḏ-Neḡo,
his limbs shall be taken, and his house made a dunghill, because there is no
other Elah who is able to deliver like this.” 
Dan
3:30  Then the sovereign promoted Shaḏraḵ,
Mĕyshaḵ, and Aḇĕḏ-Neḡo in the province of Baḇel.

Dan
4:1  Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar
the sovereign, to all peoples, nations and languages that dwell in all the
earth: Peace be increased to you.
Dan
4:2  I thought it good to declare the
signs and wonders which the Most High Elah has worked for me. 
Dan
4:3  How great are His signs, and how
mighty His wonders! His reign is an everlasting reign, and His rulership is
from generation to generation. 
Dan
4:4  I, Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar,
was at rest in my house, and prospering in my palace. 
Dan
4:5  I saw a dream and it frightened me,
and the thoughts on my bed and the visions of my head alarmed me. 
Dan
4:6  So I issued a decree to bring in all
the wise ones of Baḇel before me, to make known to me the interpretation
of the dream. 
Dan
4:7  So the magicians, the astrologers,
the Chaldeans, and the diviners came in, and I related the dream to them, but
its interpretation they did not make known to me. 
Dan
4:8  And at last Dani’ĕl, whose name
is Bĕlteshatstsar, according to the name of my elah, came before me. In
him is the Spirit of the Set-apart Elah. So I related the dream to him, saying,

Dan
4:9  “Bĕlteshatstsar, chief of the
magicians, because I know that the Spirit of the Set-apart Elah is in you, and
no secret is too difficult for you, explain to me the visions of my dream that
I have seen, and its interpretation. 
Dan
4:10  “Now the visions of my head on my
bed were these: I looked, and saw a tree in the midst of the earth, and its
height great. 
Dan
4:11  “The tree became great and strong,
and its height reached to the heavens, and it was visible to the ends of all
the earth. 
Dan
4:12  “Its leaves were lovely, and its
fruit plenty, and in it was food for all. The beasts of the field found shade
under it, and the birds of the heavens dwelt in its branches, and all flesh was
fed from it. 
Dan
4:13  “In the visions of my head on my
bed, I looked and saw a Watcher, even a set-apart one, coming down from the
heavens. 
Dan
4:14  “He cried aloud and said this, ‘Hew
down the tree and cut off its branches, strip off its leaves and scatter its
fruit. Let the beasts flee from under it, and the birds from its branches. 
Dan
4:15  ‘But leave the stump of its roots
in the earth, even with a band of iron and bronze, in the tender grass of the
field. And let it be wet with the dew of the heavens, and let his portion be
with the beasts on the grass of the earth. 
Dan
4:16  ‘Let his heart be changed from man’s,
let him be given the heart of a beast, and seven times pass over him. 
Dan
4:17  ‘This matter is by the decree of
the watchers, and the command by the word of the set-apart ones, so that the
living know that the Most High is ruler in the reign of men, and gives it to
whomever He wishes, and sets over it the lowest of men.’ 
Dan
4:18  “This dream have I seen, I,
Sovereign Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar. And you, Bĕlteshatstsar,
reveal its interpretation, since all the wise ones of my reign are unable to
make known to me the interpretation. But you are able, for the Spirit of the
Set-apart Elah is in you.” 
Dan
4:19  Then Dani’ĕl, whose name was Bĕlteshatstsar,
was stunned for a short time, and his thoughts alarmed him. The sovereign
responded and said, “Bĕlteshatstsar, do not let the dream or its
interpretation alarm you.” Bĕlteshatstsar answered and said, “My master,
the dream is to those who hate you, and its interpretation to your enemies! 
Dan
4:20  “The tree you saw, which became
great and strong, whose height reached to the heavens and was visible to all
the earth, 
Dan
4:21  whose leaves were lovely and its
fruit plenty, and in it was food for all, under which the beasts of the field
dwelt, and on whose branches the birds of the heavens sat – 
Dan
4:22  it is you, O sovereign, for you
have become great and strong. And your greatness has grown, and has reached to
the heavens and your rulership to the end of the earth. 
Dan
4:23  “And as the sovereign saw a
Watcher, even a set-apart one, coming down from the heavens, and he said, ‘Hew
down the tree and destroy it, but leave the stump of its roots in the earth,
even with a band of iron and bronze in the tender grass of the field. And let
it be wet with the dew of the heavens, and let his portion be with the beasts
of the field, till seven times pass over him’ – 
Dan
4:24  this is the interpretation, O
sovereign, and this is the decree of the Most High, which has come upon my
master the sovereign: 
Dan
4:25  “That you are going to be driven
away from men, and your dwelling be with the beasts of the field, and you be
given grass to eat like oxen, and you be wetted with the dew of the heavens,
and seven times pass over you, till you know that the Most High is ruler in the
reign of men, and that He gives it to whomever He wishes. 
Dan
4:26  “And they that gave the command to
leave the stump of its roots of the tree: your reign remains yours, from the
time you come to know that the heavens are ruling. 
Dan
4:27  “Therefore, O sovereign, let my
counsel be acceptable to you, and break off your sins by righteousness, and
your crookednesses by showing favour to the poor – your prosperity might be
extended.” 
Dan
4:28  All this came upon Sovereign Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar.

Dan
4:29  At the end of the twelve months he
was walking about the palace of the reign of Baḇel. 
Dan
4:30  The sovereign spoke and said, “Is
not this great Baḇel, which I myself have built, for the house of the
reign, by the might of my power and for the esteem of my splendour?” 
Dan
4:31  The word was still in the sovereign’s
mouth, when a voice fell from the heavens, “Sovereign Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar,
to you it is spoken: the reign has been taken away from you, 
Dan
4:32  and you are driven away from men,
and your dwelling is to be with the beasts of the field. You are given grass to
eat like oxen, and seven seasons shall pass over you, until you know that the
Most High is ruler in the reign of men, and He gives it to whomever He wishes.”

Dan
4:33  In that hour the word was executed
on Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar, and he was driven from men and he ate
grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of the heavens till his hair
had grown like eagles’ feathers and
his nails like birds’ claws. 
Dan
4:34  And at the end of the days I, Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar,
lifted my eyes to the heavens, and my understanding returned to me. And I
blessed the Most High and praised and made Him great who lives forever, whose
rule is an everlasting rule, and His reign is from generation to generation. 
Dan
4:35  And all the inhabitants of the
earth are of no account, and He does as He wishes with the host of the heavens
and among the inhabitants of the earth. And there is none to strike against His
hand or say to Him, “What have You done?” 
Dan
4:36  At the same time my understanding
returned to me, and for the preciousness of my reign, my esteem and splendour
were returning to me. And my counsellors and nobles sought me out, and I was
re-established to my reign, and excellent greatness was added to me. 
Dan
4:37  Now I, Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar,
am praising and exalting and esteeming the Sovereign of the heavens, for all
His works are truth, and His ways right. And those who walk in pride He is able
to humble. 
Dan
5:1  Bĕlshatstsar the sovereign made
a great feast for a thousand of his great men, and drank wine in the presence
of the thousand. 
Dan
5:2  While tasting the wine, Bĕlshatstsar
gave orders to bring the gold and silver vessels which his father Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar
had taken from the Hĕḵal which had been in Yerushalayim, that the
sovereign and his great men, his wives, and his concubines could drink from
them. 
Dan
5:3  Then they brought the gold vessels
that had been taken from the Hĕḵal of the House of Elah which had
been in Yerushalayim. And the sovereign and his great men, his wives, and his
concubines drank out of them. 
Dan
5:4  They drank wine, and praised the
elahin of gold, and of silver, of bronze, of iron, of wood and of stone. 
Dan
5:5  At that moment the fingers of a man’s
hand appeared and wrote opposite the lampstand on the plaster of the wall of
the sovereign’s palace. And the sovereign saw the part of the hand that wrote. 
Dan
5:6  Then the sovereign’s colour changed,
and his thoughts alarmed him, so that the joints of his hips were loosened and
his knees knocked against each other. 
Dan
5:7  The sovereign called loudly to bring
in the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the diviners. The sovereign spoke and
said to the wise ones of Baḇel, “Whoever reads this writing, and shows me
its interpretation, is robed in purple and has a chain of gold around his neck,
and shall be the third ruler in the reign.” 
Dan
5:8  So all the sovereign’s wise ones
came, but they were unable to read the writing, or to make known its
interpretation to the sovereign. 
Dan
5:9  Then Sovereign Bĕlshatstsar was
greatly alarmed, and his colour changed, and his great men were puzzled. 
Dan
5:10  The sovereigness, because of the
words of the sovereign and his great men, came to the banquet hall. And the
sovereigness spoke and said, “O sovereign, live forever! Do not let your
thoughts alarm you, nor let your colour change. 
Dan
5:11  “There is a man in your reign in
whom is the Spirit of the Set-apart Elah. And in the days of your father, light
and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the elahin, were found in him.
And Sovereign Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar your father, your father the
sovereign, made him chief of the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, and
diviners, 
Dan
5:12  because an excellent spirit,
knowledge and understanding, interpreting dreams, and explaining riddles, and
solving difficult problems were found in this Dani’ĕl, whom the sovereign
named Bĕlteshatstsar. Now let Dani’ĕl be called, and let him show the
interpretation.” 
Dan
5:13  So Dani’ĕl was brought in
before the sovereign. The sovereign spoke and said to Dani’ĕl, “Are you
that Dani’ĕl who is one of the sons of the exile from Yehuḏah, whom
my father the sovereign brought from Yehuḏah? 
Dan
5:14  “I have heard of you, that the
Spirit of Elah is in you, and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom
are found in you. 
Dan
5:15  “And the wise ones, the
astrologers, have been brought in before me, that they should read this writing
and make known to me its interpretation, but they were unable to show the
interpretation of the word. 
Dan
5:16  “And I myself have heard of you,
that you are able to give interpretations and to solve difficult problems. Now
if you are able to read the writing and make known its interpretation to me,
you are to be robed in purple and have a chain of gold around your neck, and
shall be the third ruler in the reign.” 
Dan
5:17  Then Dani’ĕl answered and said
before the sovereign, “Let your gifts be for yourself, and give your rewards to
another. Yet I shall read the writing to the sovereign, and make known the
interpretation to him. 
Dan
5:18  “O sovereign, the Most High Elah
gave Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar your father a reign and greatness, and
preciousness and esteem. 
Dan
5:19  “And because of the greatness which
He gave him, all peoples, nations, and languages trembled and feared before
him. Whomever he wished he executed, and whomever he wished he kept alive, and
whomever he wished he raised up, and whomever he wished he made low. 
Dan
5:20  “But when his heart was lifted up,
and his spirit was so strong as to act proudly, he was put down from his throne
of reign, and they took his preciousness from him. 
Dan
5:21  “Then he was driven from the sons
of men, and his heart was made like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the
wild donkeys. He was given grass to eat like oxen, and his body was wet with
the dew of the heavens, till he knew that the Most High Elah is ruler in the
reign of men, and He sets up over it whomever He wishes. 
Dan
5:22  “And you his son, Bĕlshatstsar,
have not humbled your heart, although you knew all this. 
Dan
5:23  “And you have lifted yourself up
against the Master of the heavens. And they brought before you the vessels of
His house, and you and your great men, your wives and your concubines, have
been drinking wine from them. And you have praised the elahin of silver, and of
gold, of bronze, of iron, of wood, and of stone, which neither see nor hear nor
know. But the Elah who holds your breath in His hand and owns all your ways,
you have not made great. 
Dan
5:24  “Then the part of the hand was sent
from Him, and this writing was inscribed. 
Dan
5:25  “And this is the writing that was
inscribed: MENĔ, MENĔ, TEQĔL, UPHARSIN. 
Dan
5:26  “This is the interpretation of each
word: MENĔ – Elah has numbered your reign, and put an end to it. 
Dan
5:27  “TEQĔL – You have been weighed
on the scales, and found lacking. 
Dan
5:28  “PERES – Your reign has been
divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.” 
Dan
5:29  Then Bĕlshatstsar gave orders,
and they robed Dani’ĕl in purple and put a chain of gold around his neck,
and they proclaimed concerning him that he is the third ruler in the reign. 
Dan
5:30  In that night Bĕlshatstsar,
sovereign of the Chaldeans, was slain. 
Dan
5:31  And Dareyawesh the Mede took over
the reign, being about sixty-two years old. 
Dan
6:1  It pleased Dareyawesh to appoint
over the reign one hundred and twenty viceroys, to be over all the reign, 
Dan
6:2  and over them three governors, of
whom Dani’ĕl was one, so that these viceroys should give account to them,
and the sovereign suffer no loss. 
Dan
6:3  Then this Dani’ĕl distinguished
himself above the governors and viceroys, because an excellent spirit was in
him. And the sovereign planned to appoint him over all the reign. 
Dan
6:4  Then the governors and viceroys
sought to find occasion against Dani’ĕl concerning the reign. But they
were unable to find occasion or corruption, because he was steadfast, and no
negligence or corruption was found in him. 
Dan
6:5  Then these men said, “We shall not
find any occasion against this Dani’ĕl unless we find it against him
concerning the law of his Elah.” 
Dan
6:6  Then these governors and viceroys
tumultuously gathered before the sovereign, and said this to him, “Sovereign
Dareyawesh, live forever! 
Dan
6:7  “All the governors of the reign, the
nobles and viceroys, the counsellors and advisors, have consulted together to
establish a royal decree and to make a strong interdict, that whoever petitions
any elah or man for thirty days, except you, O sovereign, is thrown into the
den of lions.
Dan
6:8  “Now, O sovereign, establish the
interdict and sign the writing, so that it is not to be changed, according to
the law of the Medes and Persians, which does not pass away.” 
Dan
6:9  So Sovereign Dareyawesh signed the
written interdict. 
Dan
6:10  And Dani’ĕl, when he knew that
the writing was signed, went home and in his upper room with his windows open
toward Yerushalayim he knelt down on his knees three times a day, and prayed
and gave thanks before his Elah, as he had done before. 
Dan
6:11  Then these men tumultuously
gathered and found Dani’ĕl praying and entreating before his Elah. 
Dan
6:12  Then they approached the sovereign,
and spoke concerning the sovereign’s interdict, “Have you not signed a
interdict that every man who petitions any elah or man within thirty days,
except you, O sovereign, is thrown into the den of lions?” The sovereign
answered and said, “The word is certain, according to the law of the Medes and
Persians, which does not pass away.” 
Dan
6:13  Then they answered and said before
the sovereign, “Dani’ĕl, who is one of the sons of the exile from Yehuḏah,
pays no heed to you, O sovereign, nor for the interdict that you have signed,
but makes his petition three times a day.” 
Dan
6:14  Then the sovereign, when he heard
these words, was greatly displeased with himself, and set his heart on Dani’ĕl
to deliver him. And he laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver him. 
Dan
6:15  Then these men tumultuously
gathered before the sovereign, and said to the sovereign, “Know, O sovereign,
that it is the law of the Medes and Persians that any interdict or decree which
the sovereign establishes is not to be changed.”
Dan
6:16  Then the sovereign gave orders, and
they brought Dani’ĕl and threw him into the den of lions. But the
sovereign spoke and said to Dani’ĕl, “Your Elah, whom you serve
continually, He Himself delivers you.” 
Dan
6:17  And a stone was brought and laid on
the mouth of the den, and the sovereign sealed it with his own signet and with
the signets of his great men, that the situation concerning Dani’ĕl might
not be changed. 
Dan
6:18  And the sovereign went to his
palace and spent the night fasting. And no entertainment was brought before
him, and his sleep fled from him. 
Dan
6:19  Then the sovereign rose up very
early in the morning and hurried to the den of lions. 
Dan
6:20  And when he came to the den, he
called with a grieved voice to Dani’ĕl. The sovereign spoke and said to
Dani’ĕl, “Dani’ĕl, servant of the living Elah, has your Elah, whom
you serve continually, been able to deliver you from the lions?” 
Dan
6:21  Then Dani’ĕl said to the
sovereign, “O sovereign, live forever! 
Dan
6:22  “My Elah has sent His messenger and
has shut the lions’ mouths, and they did not harm me, because I was found
innocent before Him. And also before you, O sovereign, I have done no harm.” 
Dan
6:23  Then the sovereign was very glad
and gave orders that Dani’ĕl be taken up out of the den. And Dani’ĕl
was taken up out of the den, and no harm was found on him, because he trusted
in his Elah. 
Dan
6:24  And the sovereign gave orders and
they brought those men who had accused Dani’ĕl, and they threw them, their
children, and their wives into the den of lions. And the lions overpowered
them, and broke all their bones in pieces before they reached the floor of the
den. 
Dan
6:25  Then Sovereign Dareyawesh wrote to
all peoples, nations, and languages that dwell in all the earth: “Peace be
increased to you. 
Dan
6:26  “From before me is made a decree
that throughout every rule of my reign men are to tremble and fear before the
Elah of Dani’ĕl, for He is the living Elah, and steadfast forever. And His
reign is one which is not destroyed, and His rule is unto the end. 
Dan
6:27  “He delivers and rescues, and He
works signs and wonders in the heavens and on earth, for He has delivered Dani’ĕl
from the power of the lions.” 
Dan
6:28  And this Dani’ĕl prospered in
the reign of Dareyawesh and in the reign of Koresh the Persian. 
Dan
7:1  In the first year of Bĕlshatstsar
sovereign of Baḇel, Dani’ĕl had a dream and visions of his head on
his bed. Then he wrote down the dream, giving a summary of the matters. 
Dan
7:2  Dani’ĕl spoke and said, “I was
looking in my vision by night and saw the four winds of the heavens stirring up
the Great Sea. 
Dan
7:3  “And four great beasts came up from
the sea, different from one another. 
Dan
7:4  “The first was like a lion, and had
eagle’s wings. I was looking until its wings were plucked off, and it was
lifted up from the earth and made to stand on two feet like a man, and it was
given a man’s heart. 
Dan
7:5  “And see, another beast, a second,
like a bear. And it was raised up on one side, and had three ribs in its mouth
between its teeth. And they said this to it, ‘Arise, devour much flesh!’ 
Dan
7:6  “After this I looked and saw
another, like a leopard, which had on its back four wings of a bird. The beast
also had four heads, and rule was given to it. 
Dan
7:7  “After this I looked in the night
visions and saw a fourth beast, fearsome and burly, exceedingly strong. And it
had great iron teeth. It devoured and crushed, and trampled down the rest with
its feet. And it was different from all the beasts that were before it, and it
had ten horns. 
Dan
7:8  “I was thinking about the horns,
then saw another horn, a little one, coming up among them, and three of the
first horns were plucked out by the roots before it. And see, eyes like the
eyes of a man were in this horn, and a mouth speaking great words. 
Dan
7:9  “I was looking until thrones were
set up, and the Ancient of Days was seated. His garment was white as snow, and
the hair of His head was like clean wool, His throne was flames of fire, its
wheels burning fire. 
Dan
7:10  “A stream of fire was flowing and
coming forth from His presence, and a thousand thousands served Him, and ten
thousand times ten thousand stood before Him, the Judge was seated, and the
books were opened. 
Dan
7:11  “I was looking. Then, because of
the sound of the great words which the horn was speaking, I was looking until
the beast was slain, and its body destroyed and given to the burning fire, 
Dan
7:12  and the rest of the beasts had
their rule taken away. But a lengthening of life was given to them, for a
season and a time. 
Dan
7:13  “I was looking in the night visions
and saw One like the Son of Enosh, coming with the clouds of the heavens! And
He came to the Ancient of Days, and they brought Him near before Him.
Dan
7:14  “And to Him was given rulership and
preciousness and a reign, that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve
Him. His rule is an everlasting rule which shall not pass away, and His reign
that which shall not be destroyed. 
Dan
7:15  “As for me, Dani’ĕl, my spirit
was pierced within my body, and the visions of my head alarmed me. 
Dan
7:16  “I drew near to one of those who
stood by, and asked him the certainty of all this. And he spoke to me and made
known to me the interpretation of the matters: 
Dan
7:17  ‘These great beasts, which are
four, are four sovereigns which rise up from the earth. 
Dan
7:18  ‘Then the set-apart ones of the
Most High shall receive the reign, and possess the reign forever, even forever
and ever.’ 
Dan
7:19  “Then I desired for certainty
concerning the fourth beast, which was different from all the others, very
fearsome, with its teeth of iron and its nails of bronze, which devoured,
crushed, and trampled down the rest with its feet, 
Dan
7:20  and concerning the ten horns that
were on its head, and of the other horn
that came up, before which three fell – this horn which had eyes and a mouth
which spoke great words, whose
appearance was greater than his fellows. 
Dan
7:21  “I was looking, and this horn was
fighting against the set-apart ones, and was prevailing against them, 
Dan
7:22  until the Ancient of Days came, and
right-ruling was given to the set-apart ones of the Most High, and the time
came and the set-apart ones took possession of the reign. 
Dan
7:23  “This is what he said, ‘The fourth
beast is the fourth reign on earth, which is different from all other reigns,
and it devours all the earth, tramples it down and crushes it. 
Dan
7:24  ‘And the ten horns are ten
sovereigns from this reign. They shall rise, and another shall rise after them,
and it is different from the first ones, and it humbles three sovereigns, 
Dan
7:25  and it speaks words against the
Most High, and it wears out the set-apart ones of the Most High, and it intends
to change appointed times and law, and they are given into its hand for a time
and times and half a time.
Dan
7:26  ‘But the Judgement shall sit, and
they shall take away its rule, to cut off and to destroy, until the end. 
Dan
7:27  ‘And the reign, and the rulership,
and the greatness of the reigns under all the heavens, shall be given to the
people, the set-apart ones of the Most High. His reign is an everlasting reign,
and all rulerships shall serve and obey Him.’ 
Dan
7:28  “This is the end of the matter. As
for me, Dani’ĕl, my thoughts greatly alarmed me, and my colour changed.
And I kept the matter in my heart.” 
Dan
8:1  In the third year of the reign of Bĕlshatstsar
the sovereign, a vision appeared to me, Dani’ĕl, after the one that
appeared to me the first time. 
Dan
8:2  And I looked in the vision, and it
came to be while I was looking, that I was in the citadel of Shushan, which is
in the province of Ĕylam. And I looked in the vision, and I was by the
River Ulai. 
Dan
8:3  And I lifted my eyes and looked and
saw a ram standing beside the river, and it had two horns, and the two horns
were high. And the one was higher than the other, and the higher one came up
last. 
Dan
8:4  I saw the ram pushing westward, and
northward, and southward, so that no beast could stand before him, and there
was no one to deliver from his hand, while he did as he pleased and became
great. 
Dan
8:5  And I was observing and saw a male
goat came from the west, over the surface of all the earth, without touching
the ground. And the goat had a conspicuous horn between his eyes. 
Dan
8:6  And he came to the ram that had two
horns, which I had seen standing beside the river, and ran at him in the rage
of his power. 
Dan
8:7  And I saw him come close to the ram,
and he became embittered against him, and smote the ram, and broke his two
horns. And there was no power in the ram to withstand him, but he threw him
down to the ground and trampled on him. And there was no one to deliver the ram
from his hand. 
Dan
8:8  And the male goat became very great.
But when he was strong, the large horn was broken, and in place of it four
conspicuous ones came up toward the four winds of the heavens. 
Dan
8:9  And from one of them came a little
horn which became exceedingly great toward the south, and toward the east, and
toward the Splendid Land. 
Dan
8:10  And it became great, up to the host
of the heavens. And it caused some of the host and some of the stars to fall to
the earth, and trampled them down. 
Dan
8:11  It even exalted itself as high as
the Prince of the host. And it took that which is continual away from Him, and
threw down the foundation of His set-apart place. 
Dan
8:12  And because of transgression, an
army was given over to the horn to
oppose that which is continual. And it threw the truth down to the ground, and
it acted and prospered.
Dan
8:13  Then I heard a certain set-apart
one speaking. And another set-apart one said to that certain one who was
speaking, “Till when is the vision, concerning that which is continual, and the
transgression that lays waste, to make both the set-apart place and the host to
be trampled under foot?”
Dan
8:14  And he said to me, “For two
thousand three hundred days, then that which is set-apart shall be made right.”

Dan
8:15  And it came to be, when I, Dani’ĕl,
had seen the vision, that I sought understanding, and see, before me stood one
having the appearance of a mighty man. 
Dan
8:16  And I heard a man’s voice between the banks of Ulai, who called, and said,
“Gaḇri’ĕl, make this man understand the vision.” 
Dan
8:17  He then came near where I stood.
And when he came I feared and I fell on my face, but he said to me, “Understand,
son of man, for the vision is for the time of the end.” 
Dan
8:18  And, as he was speaking with me, I
fell stunned upon my face to the ground, but he touched me, and made me stand
up straight, 
Dan
8:19  and said, “Look, I am making known
to you what shall take place in the latter time of the wrath, for at the
appointed time shall be the end. 
Dan
8:20  “The ram which you saw, having two
horns, are the sovereigns of Media and Persia. 
Dan
8:21  “And the male goat is the sovereign
of Greece, and the large horn between its eyes is the first sovereign. 
Dan
8:22  “And that it was broken and four
stood up in its place: are four rulerships arising out of that nation, but not
in its power. 
Dan
8:23  “And in the latter time of their
rule, when the transgressors have filled up their measure, a sovereign, fierce
of face and skilled at intrigues, shall stand up. 
Dan
8:24  “And his power shall be mighty, but
not by his own power, and he shall destroy incredibly, and shall prosper and
thrive, and destroy mighty men, and the set-apart people. 
Dan
8:25  “And through his skill he shall
make deceit prosper in his hand, and hold himself to be great in his heart, and
destroy many who are at ease, and even stand against the Prince of princes –
yet without hand he shall be broken. 
Dan
8:26  “And what was said in the vision of
the evenings and mornings is truth. And hide the vision, for it is after many
days.” 
Dan
8:27  And I, Dani’ĕl, was stricken
and became sick for days. Then I rose up and went about the sovereign’s work.
And I was amazed at the vision, but there was no understanding. 
Dan
9:1  In the first year of Dareyawesh the
son of Aḥashwĕrosh, of the seed of the Medes, who was set up as
sovereign over the reign of the Chaldeans – 
Dan
9:2  in the first year of his reign I,
Dani’ĕl, observed from the Scriptures the number of the years, according
to the word of יהוה given to Yirmeyah the prophet, for the
completion of the wastes of Yerushalayim would be seventy years. 
Dan
9:3  So I set my face toward יהוה
the Elohim to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth,
and ashes. 
Dan
9:4  And I prayed to יהוה
my Elohim, and made confession, and said, “O יהוה,
great and awesome Ĕl, guarding the covenant and the kindness to those who
love Him, and to those who guard His commands. 
Dan
9:5  “We have sinned and did crookedness,
and did wrong and rebelled, to turn aside from Your commands and from Your
right-rulings. 
Dan
9:6  “And we have not listened to Your
servants the prophets, who spoke in Your Name to our sovereigns, our heads, and
our fathers, and to all the people of the land. 
Dan
9:7  “O יהוה, to
You is the righteousness, and to us the shame of face, as it is this day – to
the men of Yehuḏah, to the inhabitants of Yerushalayim and all Yisra’ĕl,
those near and those far off in all the lands to which You have driven them,
because of their trespass which they have trespassed against You. 
Dan
9:8  “O Master, to us is the shame of
face, to our sovereigns, to our heads, and to our fathers, because we have
sinned against You. 
Dan
9:9  “To יהוה our
Elohim are the compassions and forgivenesses, for we have rebelled against Him.

Dan
9:10  “And we have not obeyed the voice
of יהוה our Elohim, to walk in His Torot, which He set
before us through His servants the prophets. 
Dan
9:11  “And all Yisra’ĕl have
transgressed Your Torah, and turned aside, so as not to obey Your voice. So the
curse and the oath written in the Torah of Mosheh the servant of Elohim have
been poured out on us, for we have sinned against Him. 
Dan
9:12  “And He has confirmed His words,
which He spoke against us and against our rulers who judged us, by bringing
upon us great evil. For under all the heavens there has not been done like what
was done to Yerushalayim. 
Dan
9:13  “As it is written in the Torah of
Mosheh, all this evil has come upon us, and we have not entreated the face of יהוה
our Elohim, to turn back from our crookednesses, and to study Your truth. 
Dan
9:14  “Hence יהוה
has watched over the evil and has brought it upon us. For יהוה
our Elohim is righteous in all the works which He has done, but we have not
obeyed His voice. 
Dan
9:15  “And now, O יהוה
our Elohim, who brought Your people out of the land of Mitsrayim with a strong
hand, and made Yourself a Name, as it is this day – we have sinned, we have
done wrong! 
Dan
9:16  “O יהוה,
according to all Your righteousness, I pray, let Your displeasure and Your wrath
be turned away from Your city Yerushalayim, Your set-apart mountain. For,
because of our sins, and because of the crookednesses of our fathers,
Yerushalayim and Your people have become a reproach to all those around us. 
Dan
9:17  “And now, our Elohim, hear the
prayer of Your servant, and his supplications, and for the sake of יהוה
cause Your face to shine on Your set-apart place, which is laid waste. 
Dan
9:18  “O my Elohim, incline Your ear and
hear. Open Your eyes and see our wastes, and the city which is called by Your
Name. For we do not present our supplications before You because of our
righteous deeds, but because of Your great compassions. 
Dan
9:19  “O יהוה,
hear! O יהוה, forgive! O יהוה,
listen and act! Do not delay for Your own sake, my Elohim, for Your city and
Your people are called by Your Name.” 
Dan
9:20  And while I was speaking, and
praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Yisra’ĕl, and
presenting my supplication before יהוה my Elohim for
the set-apart mountain of my Elohim, 
Dan
9:21  while I was still speaking in
prayer, the man Gaḇri’ĕl, whom I had seen in the vision at the
beginning, came close to me, in swift flight about the time of the evening
offering. 
Dan
9:22  And he made me understand, and
talked with me, and said, “O Dani’ĕl, I have now come forth to make you
wise concerning understanding. 
Dan
9:23  “At the beginning of your
supplications a word went out, and I have come to make it known, for you are
greatly appreciated. So consider the word and understand the vision: 
Dan
9:24  “Seventy weeks are decreed for your
people and for your set-apart city, to put an end to the transgression, and to
seal up sins, and to cover crookedness, and to bring in everlasting
righteousness, and to seal up vision and prophet, and to anoint the Most
Set-apart. 
Dan
9:25  “Know, then, and understand: from
the going forth of the command to restore and build Yerushalayim until Messiah
the Prince is seven weeks and sixty-two weeks. It shall be built again, with
streets and a trench, but in times of affliction. 
Dan
9:26  “And after the sixty-two weeks
Messiah shall be cut off and have naught. And the people of a coming prince
shall destroy the city and the set-apart place. And the end of it is with a
flood. And wastes are decreed, and fighting until the end. 
Dan
9:27  “And he shall confirm a covenant
with many for one week. And in the middle of the week he shall put an end to
slaughtering and meal offering. And on the wing of abominations he shall lay
waste, even until the complete end and that which is decreed is poured out on
the one who lays waste.”
Dan
10:1  In the third year of Koresh
sovereign of Persia a word was revealed to Dani’ĕl, whose name was called
Bĕlteshatstsar. And the word was true, and the conflict great. And he
understood the word, and had understanding of the vision. 
Dan
10:2  In those days I, Dani’ĕl, was
mourning three weeks of days. 
Dan
10:3  I did not eat desirable food, and
meat and wine did not come into my mouth, and I did not anoint myself at all,
till the completion of three weeks of days. 
Dan
10:4  And on the twenty-fourth day of the
first month, while I was by the side of the great river, that is Ḥiddeqel,

Dan
10:5  then I lifted my eyes and looked
and saw a certain man dressed in linen, whose loins were girded with gold of
Uphaz! 
Dan
10:6  And his body was like beryl, and
his face like the appearance of lightning, and his eyes like torches of fire,
and his arms and feet like polished bronze in appearance, and the sound of his
words like the sound of a crowd. 
Dan
10:7  And I, Dani’ĕl, alone saw the
vision, for the men who were with me did not see the vision, but a great
trembling fell upon them, and they ran away to hide themselves. 
Dan
10:8  So I was left alone when I saw this
great vision, and no strength remained in me, for my comeliness was destroyed
in me, and I retained no strength. 
Dan
10:9  But I heard the sound of his words.
And while I heard the sound of his words I was stunned lying with my face to
the ground. 
Dan
10:10  And see, a hand touched me, and
set me trembling on my knees and on the palms of my hands. 
Dan
10:11  And he said to me, “O Dani’ĕl,
man greatly appreciated, understand the words that I speak to you, and stand
upright, for I have now been sent to you.” And while he was speaking this word
to me, I stood trembling.
Dan
10:12  And he said to me, “Do not fear,
Dani’ĕl, for from the first day that you set your heart to understand and
to humble yourself before your Elohim, your words were heard, and I have come
because of your words. 
Dan
10:13  “But the head of the rule of
Persia withstood me twenty-one days. And see, Miḵa’ĕl, one of the
chief heads, came to help me, for I had been left alone there with the
sovereigns of Persia. 
Dan
10:14  “And I have come to make you
understand what is to befall your people in the latter days. For the vision is
yet for days to come.” 
Dan
10:15  And when he had spoken such words
to me, I turned my face toward the ground and kept silent. 
Dan
10:16  And see, one who looked like the
sons of men touched my lips, and I opened my mouth and spoke and said to him
who stood before me, “My master, because of the vision I have been seized with
pains, and I have retained no strength. 
Dan
10:17  “So how was this servant of my
master able to speak with you, my master? As for me, no strength remains in me
now, nor is any breath left in me.” 
Dan
10:18  And again the one who looked like
a man touched me and strengthened me. 
Dan
10:19  And he said, “Do not fear, O man
greatly appreciated! Peace be to you, be strong now, be strong!” So when he
spoke to me I was strengthened, and said, “Let my master speak, for you have
strengthened me.” 
Dan
10:20  And he said, “Do you know why I
have come to you? And now I return to fight with the head of Persia. And when I
have left, see, the head of Greece shall come. 
Dan
10:21  “But let me declare to you what is
written in the Scripture of Truth, and there is no one supporting me against
these, except Miḵa’ĕl your head. 
Dan
11:1  “And in the first year of
Dareyawesh the Mede, I myself stood up to support and protect him. 
Dan
11:2  “And now I declare the truth to
you: See, three more sovereigns are to arise in Persia, and the fourth is to
become far richer than them all. And by his power, through his riches, he stirs
up all against the rulership of Greece. 
Dan
11:3  “And a mighty sovereign shall
arise, and he shall rule with great authority, and do as he pleases. 
Dan
11:4  “But when he has arisen, his rule
shall be broken up and divided toward the four winds of the heavens, but not
among his descendants nor according to his authority with which he ruled,
because his rule shall be uprooted, even for others besides these. 
Dan
11:5  “And a sovereign of the South shall
become strong, along with one of his princes who gains power over him and shall
rule – his rule being a great rule. 
Dan
11:6  “And at the end of years they shall
join themselves together, and a daughter of the sovereign of the South shall
come to the sovereign of the North to make an alliance. But she shall not
retain the strength of her power, nor would he or his power stand. And she
shall be given up, with those who brought her, and he who brought her forth,
and he who supported her in those times. 
Dan
11:7  “But from a branch of her roots one
shall arise in his place, and he shall come into the defence and come into a
stronghold of the sovereign of the North, and shall act against them, and shall
prevail, 
Dan
11:8  and also their mighty ones, with
their princes and their precious utensils of silver and gold he shall seize and
bring to Mitsrayim. And he shall stand more years than the sovereign of the
North. 
Dan
11:9  “Then he shall enter the reign of
the sovereign of the South, but shall return to his own land. 
Dan
11:10  “But his sons shall stir
themselves up, and assemble a great army. And he shall certainly come and
overflow and pass through, then return to his stronghold, and be stirred up. 
Dan
11:11  “Then the sovereign of the South
shall be enraged and go out to fight with him, with the sovereign of the North,
who shall raise a large army. But the army shall be given into the hand of his
enemy, 
Dan
11:12  and he shall capture the army, his
heart being exalted. And he shall cause tens of thousands to fall, but not
prevail. 
Dan
11:13  “And the sovereign of the North
shall return and raise an army greater than the former, and certainly come at
the end of some years with a great army and much supplies. 
Dan
11:14  “And in those times many shall
rise up against the sovereign of the South, while some violent ones among your
people exalt themselves to establish the vision, but they shall stumble. 
Dan
11:15  “Then the sovereign of the North
shall come in and build a siege mound, and capture a city of strongholds. And
the arms of the South shall not stand, nor his choice people, for there is no
strength to stand. 
Dan
11:16  “So his opponent shall do as he
pleases – with no one standing against him – and stand in the Splendid Land
with destruction in his hand. 
Dan
11:17  “And he shall set his face to
enter with the strength of his entire rule, and make an alliance with him. And
he shall do so, and give him the daughter of women to corrupt her. But she
shall not stand, neither be for him. 
Dan
11:18  “Then he shall turn his face to
the coastlands and capture many. But a ruler shall bring the reproach against
them to an end. And with the reproach removed, he shall turn back on him. 
Dan
11:19  “Then he shall turn his face
toward the strongholds of his own land, but shall stumble and fall, and not be
found. 
Dan
11:20  “And in his place one shall stand
up who imposes taxes on the adorned city
of the rule, but within a few days he is destroyed, but not in wrath or in
battle. 
Dan
11:21  “And in his place shall arise a
despised one, to whom they shall not give the excellency of the rule. But he
shall come in peaceably, and seize the rule by flatteries. 
Dan
11:22  “And the arms of the flood shall
be swept away from before him and be broken, and also the prince of the covenant.

Dan
11:23  “And after they joined him, he
shall work deceit, and shall come up and become strong with a small nation. 
Dan
11:24  “He shall enter peaceably, even
into the richest places of the province, and do what his fathers have not done,
nor his forefathers: distribute among them plunder and spoil and supplies, and
devise his plots against the strongholds, but only for a time. 
Dan
11:25  “And he shall stir up his power
and his heart against the sovereign of the South with a great army, and the
sovereign of the South shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and
mighty army, but not stand, for they shall devise plots against him. 
Dan
11:26  “And those who have been eating
his food shall destroy him, and his army be swept away, and many fall down
slain. 
Dan
11:27  “And both these sovereigns’ hearts
are to do evil, and speak lies at the same table, but not prosper, for the end
is still for an appointed time. 
Dan
11:28  “Then he shall return to his land
with much supplies, and his heart be against the set-apart covenant. And he
shall act, and shall return to his land. 
Dan
11:29  “At the appointed time he shall
return and go toward the south, but it shall not be like the former or the
latter. 
Dan
11:30  “For ships from Kittim shall come
against him, and he shall lose heart, and shall return in rage against the
set-apart covenant, and shall act, and shall return and consider those who
forsake the set-apart covenant. 
Dan
11:31  “And strong ones shall arise from
him and profane the set-apart place, the stronghold, and shall take away that
which is continual, and set up the abomination that lays waste.
Dan
11:32  “And by flatteries he shall
profane those who do wrong against the covenant, but the people who know their
Elohim shall be strong, and shall act. 
Dan
11:33  “And those of the people who have
insight shall give understanding to many. And they shall stumble by sword and
flame, by captivity and plundering, for days. 
Dan
11:34  “And when they stumble, they shall
be helped, a little help, but many shall join them, by flatteries. 
Dan
11:35  “And some of those who have
insight shall stumble, to refine them, and to cleanse them, and to make them
white, until the time of the end, for it is still for an appointed time. 
Dan
11:36  “And the sovereign shall do as he
pleases, and exalt himself and show himself to be great above every mighty one,
and speak incredible matters against the Ĕl of mighty ones, and shall
prosper until the wrath has been accomplished – for what has been decreed shall
be done – 
Dan
11:37  and have no regard for the mighty
ones of his fathers nor for the desire of women, nor have regard for any mighty
one, but exalt himself above them all. 
Dan
11:38  “But in his place he shall give
esteem to a mighty one of strongholds. And to a mighty one which his fathers
did not know he shall give esteem with gold and silver, with precious stones
and costly gifts. 
Dan
11:39  “And he shall act against the
strongest strongholds with a foreign mighty one, which he shall acknowledge. He
shall increase in esteem and cause them to rule over many, and divide the land
for gain. 
Dan
11:40  “At the time of the end the
sovereign of the South shall push at him, and the sovereign of the North rush
against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many
ships. And he shall enter the lands, and shall overflow and pass over,  
Dan
11:41  and shall enter the Splendid Land,
and many shall stumble, but these escape from his hand: Eḏom, and Mo’aḇ,
and the chief of the sons of Ammon. 
Dan
11:42  “And he shall stretch out his hand
against the lands, and the land of Mitsrayim shall not escape. 
Dan
11:43  “And he shall rule over the
treasures of gold and silver, and over all the riches of Mitsrayim, and Libyans
and Kushites shall be at his steps. 
Dan
11:44  “Then reports from the east and
the north shall disturb him, and he shall go out with great wrath to destroy
and put many under the ban, 
Dan
11:45  and he shall pitch the tents of
his palace between the seas and the splendid set-apart mountain, but shall come
to his end with none to help him. 
Dan
12:1  “Now at that time Miḵa’ĕl
shall stand up, the great head who is standing over the sons of your people.
And there shall be a time of distress, such as never was since there was a
nation, until that time. And at that time your people shall be delivered, every
one who is found written in the book, 
Dan
12:2  and many of those who sleep in the
dust of the earth wake up, some to everlasting life, and some to reproaches,
everlasting abhorrence. 
Dan
12:3  “And those who have insight shall
shine like the brightness of the expanse, and those who lead many to
righteousness like the stars forever and ever. 
Dan
12:4  “But you, Dani’ĕl, hide the
words, and seal the book until the time of the end. Many shall diligently
search and knowledge shall increase.”
Dan
12:5  Then I, Dani’ĕl, looked and
saw two others standing, one on this bank of the river and the other on that
bank. 
Dan
12:6  And one said to the man dressed in
linen, who was above the waters of the river, “How long until the end of these
wonders?” 
Dan
12:7  And I heard the man dressed in
linen, who was above the waters of the river, and he held up his right hand and
his left hand to the heavens, and swore by Him who lives forever, that it would
be for a time, times, and half a time. And when they have ended scattering the
power of the set-apart people, then all these shall be completed. 
Dan
12:8  And I heard, but I did not
understand, so I said, “My master, what is the latter end of these matters?” 
Dan
12:9  And he said, “Go, Dani’ĕl, for
the words are hidden and sealed till the time of the end.
Dan
12:10  “Many shall be cleansed and made
white, and refined. But the wrong shall do wrong – and none of the wrong shall
understand, but those who have insight shall understand. 
Dan
12:11  “And from the time that which is
continual is taken away, and the abomination that lays waste is set up, is one
thousand two hundred and ninety days. 
Dan
12:12  “Blessed is he who is waiting
earnestly, and comes to the one thousand three hundred and thirty-five days. 
Dan
12:13  “But you, go your way till the
end. And rest, and arise to your lot at the end of the days.”
