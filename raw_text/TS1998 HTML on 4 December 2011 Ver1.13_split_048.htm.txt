Zeḵaryah/Zechariah
Zech
1:1  In the eighth month of the second
year of Dareyawesh, the word of יהוה came to Zeḵaryah
son of Bereḵyah, son of Iddo the prophet, saying, 
Zech
1:2  “ יהוה was
very wroth with your fathers.
Zech
1:3  “And you shall say to them, ‘Thus
said יהוה of hosts, “Turn back to Me,” declares יהוה
of hosts, “and I shall turn back to you,” declares יהוה
of hosts. 
Zech
1:4  “Do not be like your fathers, to
whom the former prophets proclaimed, saying, ‘Thus said יהוה
of hosts, “Turn back now from your evil ways and your evil deeds.” ’ But they
did not obey or give heed to Me,” declares יהוה. 
Zech
1:5  “Your fathers, where are they? And
the prophets, do they live forever? 
Zech
1:6  “But My words and My laws, which I
commanded My servants the prophets, did they not overtake your fathers?” “Then
they turned back and said, ‘As יהוה of hosts planned to
do to us, according to our ways and according to our deeds, so He has done with
us.’ ” ’ ” 
Zech
1:7  On the twenty-fourth day of the
eleventh month, which is the month Sheḇat, in the second year of
Dareyawesh, the word of יהוה came to Zeḵaryah son
of Bereḵyahu, son of Iddo the prophet, saying, 
Zech
1:8  “I looked at night and saw a man
riding on a red horse, and he was standing among the myrtle trees in the shade.
And behind him were horses: red, sorrel, and white.” 
Zech
1:9  And I said, “My master, what are
these?” And the messenger who was speaking to me said to me, “Let me show you
what they are.” 
Zech
1:10  And the man who stood among the
myrtle trees answered and said, “They are the ones יהוה
has sent to go throughout the earth.” 
Zech
1:11  And they answered the messenger of יהוה,
who stood among the myrtle trees, and said, “We have gone throughout the earth,
and see, all the earth is at peace and rest.”
Zech
1:12  And the messenger of יהוה
answered and said, “O יהוה of hosts, how long would You
have no compassion on Yerushalayim and on the cities of Yehuḏah, against
which You were enraged these seventy years?” 
Zech
1:13  And יהוה
answered the messenger who talked to me, good words, comforting words. 
Zech
1:14  And the messenger who spoke with me
said to me, “Proclaim, saying, ‘Thus said יהוה of
hosts, “I have been jealous for Yerushalayim and for Tsiyon with great
jealousy. 
Zech
1:15  “And I am very wroth with the
nations who are at ease, for when I was a little wroth, they furthered the
evil!” 
Zech
1:16  ‘Therefore thus said יהוה,
“I shall return to Yerushalayim with compassion. My house shall be built in it,”
declares יהוה of hosts, “and a surveyor’s line be
stretched out over Yerushalayim.” ’ 
Zech
1:17  “Again proclaim, saying, ‘Thus said
יהוה of hosts, “Again My cities shall overflow with
goodness. And יהוה shall again comfort Tsiyon, and
shall again choose Yerushalayim.” ’ ”
Zech
1:18  And I lifted up my eyes and looked,
and saw four horns. 
Zech
1:19  And I said to the messenger who was
speaking to me, “What are these?” And he said to me, “These are the horns that
have scattered Yehuḏah, Yisra’ĕl, and Yerushalayim.” 
Zech
1:20  And יהוה
showed me four craftsmen. 
Zech
1:21  And I said, “What are these coming
to do?” And he spoke saying, “These are the horns that scattered Yehuḏah,
so that no one lifted up his head. But these come to trouble them, to throw
down the horns of the gentiles that lifted up their horn against the land of
Yehuḏah to scatter it.” 
Zech
2:1  And I lifted up my eyes and looked,
and saw a man with a measuring line in his hand. 
Zech
2:2  And I said, “Where are you going?”
And he said to me, “To measure Yerushalayim, to see what is its width and what
is its length.” 
Zech
2:3  And see, the messenger who was
speaking to me was going out. And another messenger was coming out to meet him,

Zech
2:4  and he said to him, “Run, speak to
this young man, saying, ‘Yerushalayim is to remain unwalled, because of the many
men and livestock in it. 
Zech
2:5  ‘For I Myself am to her,’ declares יהוה,
‘a wall of fire all around, and for esteem I am in her midst.’ ” 
Zech
2:6  “Oh, Oh! And flee from the land of
the north,” declares יהוה, “for I have scattered you
like the four winds of the heavens,” declares יהוה. 
Zech
2:7  “Oh, Tsiyon! Escape, you who dwell
with the daughter of Baḇel.” 
Zech
2:8  For thus said יהוה
of hosts (for the sake of esteem He sent me to the gentiles which plunder you):
“For he who touches you touches the apple of My eye.
Zech
2:9  “For look, I am waving My hand
against them, and they shall become spoil for their servants. And you shall
know that יהוה of hosts has sent Me. 
Zech
2:10  “Sing and rejoice, O daughter of
Tsiyon! For look, I am coming, and shall dwell in your midst,” declares יהוה.
Zech
2:11  “And many gentiles shall be joined
to יהוה in that day, and they shall become My people.
And I shall dwell in your midst. And you shall know that יהוה
of hosts has sent Me to you.
Zech
2:12  “And יהוה shall
inherit Yehuḏah, His portion in the Set-apart Land. And He shall again
choose Yerushalayim.
Zech
2:13  “Hush, all flesh, before יהוה,
for He has roused Himself out of His set-apart dwelling!” 
Zech
3:1  And he showed me Yehoshua the high
priest standing before the messenger of יהוה, and Satan
standing at his right hand to be an adversary to him. 
Zech
3:2  And יהוה
said to Satan, “ יהוה rebuke you, Satan! יהוה
who has chosen Yerushalayim rebuke you! Is this not a brand plucked from the
fire?” 
Zech
3:3  And Yehoshua was dressed in filthy
garments, and was standing before the messenger. 
Zech
3:4  And He answered and spoke to those
who stood before Him, saying, “Remove the filthy garments from him.” And to him
He said, “See, I have removed your guilt from you, and shall put costly robes
on you.” 
Zech
3:5  And I said, “Let them put a clean
turban on his head.” Then they put a clean turban on his head, and they put
garments on him. And the messenger of יהוה stood by. 
Zech
3:6  And the messenger of יהוה
witnessed to Yehoshua, saying, 
Zech
3:7  “Thus said יהוה
of hosts, ‘If you walk in My ways, and if you guard My duty, then you shall
also rule My house, and also guard My courts. And I shall give you access among
these standing here. 
Zech
3:8  ‘Now listen, Yehoshua the high
priest, you and your companions who sit before you, for they are men of symbol.
For look, I am bringing forth My Servant – the Branch.
Zech
3:9  ‘See the stone which I have put
before Yehoshua: on one stone are seven eyes. See, I am engraving its
inscription,’ declares יהוה of hosts, ‘and I shall
remove the guilt of that land in one day. 
Zech
3:10  ‘In that day,’ declares יהוה
of hosts, ‘you shall invite one another, under the vine and under the fig tree.’
” 
Zech
4:1  And the messenger who was speaking
to me came back and woke me up as a man is awakened from sleep. 
Zech
4:2  And he said to me, “What do you see?”
So I said, “I have looked, and see: a lampstand all of gold with a bowl on top
of it, and on the stand seven lamps with seven spouts to the seven lamps. 
Zech
4:3  “And two olive trees are by it, one
at the right of the bowl and the other at its left.” 
Zech
4:4  Then I responded and spoke to the
messenger who was speaking to me, saying, “What are these, my master?” 
Zech
4:5  And the messenger who was speaking
to me answered and said to me, “Do you not know what these are?” And I said, “No,
my master.” 
Zech
4:6  And he answered and said to me, “This
is the word of יהוה to Zerubbaḇel, ‘Not by might
nor by power, but by My Spirit,’ said יהוה of hosts. 
Zech
4:7  ‘Who are you, great mountain, before
Zerubbaḇel? A plain! And he shall bring forth the capstone with shouts of
“Favour, favour to it!” ’ ” 
Zech
4:8  And the word of יהוה
came to me, saying, 
Zech
4:9  “The hands of Zerubbaḇel have
laid the foundation of this House, and his hands shall complete it. And you
shall know that יהוה of hosts has sent Me to you. 
Zech
4:10  “For who has despised the day of
small beginnings? They shall rejoice
when they see the plumb-line in the hand of Zerubbaḇel. These seven are
the eyes of יהוה, which diligently search throughout
all the earth.” 
Zech
4:11  Then I responded and said to him, “What
are these two olive trees, one at the right of the lampstand and the other at
its left?” 
Zech
4:12  And I responded a second time and
said to him, “What are these two olive branches which empty golden oil from themselves by means of the two
gold pipes?” 
Zech
4:13  And he answered me and said, “Do
you not know what these are?” And I said, “No, my master.” 
Zech
4:14  And he said, “These are the two
anointed ones, who stand beside the Master of all the earth.”
Zech
5:1  And I lifted up my eyes again, and
looked and saw a flying scroll. 
Zech
5:2  And he said to me, “What do you see?”
And I answered, “I see a flying scroll, twenty cubits long and ten cubits wide.”

Zech
5:3  And he said to me, “This is the
curse that goes forth over the face of all the earth: ‘everyone who is stealing
shall go unpunished,’ on the one side, according to it, and, ‘everyone who has
sworn falsely shall go unpunished,’
on the other side, according to it.” 
Zech
5:4  “I shall send it out,” declares יהוה
of hosts, “and it shall come into the house of the thief and the house of the
one who shall swear falsely by My Name. And it shall remain in the midst of his
house and shall consume it, both its timber and stones.” 
Zech
5:5  And the messenger who was speaking
with me came out and said to me, “Lift up your eyes now, and see what this is
that is going forth.” 
Zech
5:6  And I said, “What is it?” And he
said, “It is an ĕphah-measure that is going forth.” Again he said, “This
is their appearance throughout the earth: 
Zech
5:7  “And see, a lead cover lifted up,
and this: a woman sitting inside the ĕphah-measure!” 
Zech
5:8  And he said, “This is Wrongness!”
And he threw her down into the ĕphah-measure, and threw the lead weight
over its mouth. 
Zech
5:9  And I lifted up my eyes, and looked
and saw two women, coming with the wind in their wings. And they had wings like
the wings of a stork, and they lifted up the ĕphah-measure between earth
and the heavens. 
Zech
5:10  Then I said to the messenger who
was speaking to me, “Where are they taking the ĕphah-measure?” 
Zech
5:11  And he said to me, “To build a
house for it in the land of Shin‛ar. And it shall be established and set
there on its own base.” 
Zech
6:1  And I lifted up my eyes again, and
looked and saw four chariots coming from between two mountains, and the
mountains were mountains of bronze. 
Zech
6:2  With the first chariot were red
horses, and with the second chariot black horses, 
Zech
6:3  and with the third chariot white
horses, and with the fourth chariot strong speckled horses. 
Zech
6:4  So I responded and said to the
messenger who was speaking to me, “What are these, my master?” 
Zech
6:5  And the messenger answered and said
to me, “These are four spirits of the heavens, coming forth from presenting
themselves before the Master of all the earth. 
Zech
6:6  “The one with the black horses is
going out to the land of the north, and the white ones have gone out after
them, and the speckled ones have gone out to the land of the south.” 
Zech
6:7  And the strong ones went out, eager
to go, to walk to and fro in the earth. And He said, “Go, walk to and fro in
the earth.” So they walked to and fro in the earth. 
Zech
6:8  And He called to me, and spoke to
me, saying, “See, those who go toward the land of the north have given rest to
My Spirit in the land of the north.” 
Zech
6:9  And the word of יהוה
came to me, saying, 
Zech
6:10  “Receive the gift from the exiles,
from Ḥeldai, Toḇiyah, and Yeḏayah, who have come from Baḇel.
Then you shall go the same day and enter the house of Yoshiyah son of
Tsephanyah. 
Zech
6:11  “And you shall take the silver and
gold, make a crown, and set it on the head of Yehoshua the son of Yehotsaḏaq,
the high priest, 
Zech
6:12  and shall speak to him, saying, ‘Thus
said יהוה of hosts, saying, “See, the Man whose name is
the Branch! And from His place He shall branch out, and He shall build the Hĕḵal
of יהוה.
Zech
6:13  “It is He who is going to build the
Hĕḵal of יהוה. It is He who is going to bear
the splendour. And He shall sit and rule on His throne, and shall be a priest
on His throne, and the counsel of peace shall be between Them both,” ’ 
Zech
6:14  while the crown is for a
remembrance in the Hĕḵal of יהוה to Ḥĕlem,
and to Toḇiyah, and to Yeḏayah, and to Ḥĕn son of
Tsephanyah. 
Zech
6:15  “And those who are far away shall
come and build the Hĕḵal of יהוה. And you
shall know that יהוה of hosts has sent Me to you. And
this shall be, if you diligently obey the voice of יהוה
your Elohim.” 
Zech
7:1  And in the fourth year of Sovereign
Dareyawesh it came to be that the word of יהוה came to
Zeḵaryah, on the fourth of the ninth month, Kislĕw.
Zech
7:2  Now Bĕyth Ĕl had sent Shar’etser,
with Reḡem-Meleḵ and his men, to pray before יהוה,

Zech
7:3  speaking to the priests who belonged
to the House of יהוה of hosts, and to the prophets,
saying, “Should I weep in the fifth month and fast as I have done for so many years?”

Zech
7:4  Then the word of יהוה
of hosts came to me, saying, 
Zech
7:5  “Speak to all the people of the
land, and to the priests, saying, ‘When you fasted and lamented in the fifth
and seventh months all these seventy years, did you truly fast for Me – for Me?

Zech
7:6  ‘And when you ate and when you
drank, was it not for those eating and for those drinking? 
Zech
7:7  ‘Are these not the words which יהוה
proclaimed through the former prophets when Yerushalayim and the cities around it
were inhabited and in safety, and the South and the low country were inhabited?’
” 
Zech
7:8  And the word of יהוה
came to Zeḵaryah, saying, 
Zech
7:9  “Thus said יהוה
of hosts, ‘Execute true right-ruling, show kindness and compassion everyone to
his brother. 
Zech
7:10  “Do not oppress the widow or the
fatherless, the stranger or the poor. And do not plot evil in your hearts
against one another.’ 
Zech
7:11  “But they refused to listen, and
they shrugged their shoulders, and stopped their ears from hearing. 
Zech
7:12  “And they made their hearts like
flint against hearing the Torah, and the words, which יהוה
of hosts had sent by His Spirit through the former prophets. Therefore great
wrath came from יהוה of hosts. 
Zech
7:13  “And it came to be: as He called
and they did not hear, so let them call, but I shall not hear,” said יהוה
of hosts. 
Zech
7:14  “And I scattered them with a storm
wind among all the gentiles which they had not known. And the land was laid
waste behind them, no one passing through or returning, for they made the
pleasant land a waste.” 
Zech
8:1  And the word of יהוה
of hosts came, saying, 
Zech
8:2  “Thus said יהוה
of hosts, ‘I shall be jealous for Tsiyon with great jealousy, with great wrath
I shall be jealous for her.’ 
Zech
8:3  “Thus said יהוה,
‘I shall return to Tsiyon, and I shall dwell in the midst of Yerushalayim. And
Yerushalayim shall be called: City of the Truth, and the Mountain of יהוה
of hosts, the Set-apart Mountain.’
Zech
8:4  “Thus said יהוה
of hosts, ‘Again old men and old women shall dwell in the streets of
Yerushalayim, each one with his staff in his hand because of great age, 
Zech
8:5  and the streets of the city shall be
filled with boys and girls playing in its streets.’ 
Zech
8:6  “Thus said יהוה
of hosts, ‘If it is marvellous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in
these days, should it also be marvellous in My eyes?’ declares יהוה
of hosts. 
Zech
8:7  “Thus said יהוה
of hosts, ‘See, I am saving My people from the land of the sunrise and from the
land of the sunset. 
Zech
8:8  ‘And I shall bring them back, and
they shall dwell in the midst of Yerushalayim. And they shall be My people, and
I shall be their Elohim, in truth and in righteousness.’ 
Zech
8:9  “Thus said יהוה
of hosts, ‘Let your hands be strong, you who are listening in these days to
these words, from the mouth of the prophets, of the day the foundation was laid
for the House of יהוה of hosts, the Hĕḵal
that was to be rebuilt. 
Zech
8:10  ‘For before these days there was
not a wage for a man, nor a hire for beast, and there was no peace for him who
went out or came in, because of his enemies, and I set all men one against
another. 
Zech
8:11  ‘But now I am not as in the former
days to the remnant of this people,’ declares יהוה of
hosts. 
Zech
8:12  ‘Because of the sowing of peace the
vine does give its fruit, the ground does give her increase, and the heavens do
give their dew. And I shall cause the remnant of this people to inherit all
these. 
Zech
8:13  ‘And it shall be, as you were a
curse among the gentiles, O house of Yehuḏah and house of Yisra’ĕl,
so I shall save you, and you shall be a blessing. Do not fear, let your hands
be strong.’ 
Zech
8:14  “For thus said יהוה
of hosts, ‘As I purposed to do evil to you when your fathers provoked Me,’ declares
יהוה of hosts, ‘and I did not relent, 
Zech
8:15  so again in these days I have
purposed to do good to Yerushalayim and to the house of Yehuḏah. Do not
fear! 
Zech
8:16  ‘These are the words you should do:
speak the truth to one another, judge with truth and right-ruling for peace in
your gates. 
Zech
8:17  ‘And do not plot evil in your heart
against another, and do not love a false oath. For all these I hate,’ declares יהוה.”

Zech
8:18  And the word of יהוה
of hosts came to me, saying, 
Zech
8:19  “Thus said יהוה
of hosts, ‘The fast of the fourth, and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of
the seventh, and the fast of the tenth months,
are to be joy and gladness, and pleasant appointed times for the house of Yehuḏah
– and they shall love the truth and the peace.’ 
Zech
8:20  “Thus said יהוה
of hosts, ‘Peoples shall yet come, inhabitants of many cities, 
Zech
8:21  and the inhabitants of the one go
to another, saying, “Let us earnestly go and pray before יהוה,
and seek יהוה of hosts. I myself am going.” 
Zech
8:22  ‘And many peoples and strong
nations shall come to seek יהוה of hosts in
Yerushalayim, and to pray before יהוה.’ 
Zech
8:23  “Thus said יהוה
of hosts, ‘In those days ten men from all languages of the nations take hold, yea,
they shall take hold of the edge of the garment of a man, a Yehuḏite,
saying, “Let us go with you, for we have heard that Elohim is with you.” ’ ”
Zech
9:1  The message of the word of יהוה
against the land of Ḥaḏraḵ, and Damascus its resting place –
when the eye of man and all the tribes of Yisra’ĕl are on יהוה
– 
Zech
9:2  and Ḥamath also borders on it,
Tsor and Tsiḏon, though they are very wise. 
Zech
9:3  For Tsor built herself a tower,
heaped up silver like the dust, and gold like the mud of the streets. 
Zech
9:4  See, יהוה
shall dispossess her, and He shall destroy her power in the sea, and she shall
be consumed by fire. 
Zech
9:5  Ashqelon sees it and fears, Azzah
too, writhing in anguish, and Eqron, for her expectation has dried up. And the
sovereign shall perish from Azzah, and Ashqelon shall not be inhabited. 
Zech
9:6  “And a half-breed shall settle in
Ashdoḏ. So I shall cut off the pride of the Philistines, 
Zech
9:7  and shall take away his blood from
his mouth, and the abominations from between his teeth. And he shall remain,
even he, to our Elohim, and he shall be like a leader in Yehuḏah, and
Eqron like a Yeḇusite. 
Zech
9:8  And I shall encamp around My house,
against an army, against him who passes by and him who returns, so that no oppressor
passes through them again, for now I have seen with My eyes. 
Zech
9:9  “Rejoice greatly, O daughter of
Tsiyon! Shout, O daughter of Yerushalayim! See, your Sovereign is coming to
you, He is righteous and endowed with deliverance, humble and riding on a
donkey, a colt, the foal of a donkey.
Zech
9:10  “And I shall cut off the chariot
from Ephrayim and the horse from Yerushalayim. And the battle bow shall be cut
off. And He shall speak peace to the nations, and His rule is from sea to sea,
and from the River to the ends of the earth. 
Zech
9:11  “Also you, because of the blood of
your covenant, I shall send your prisoners out of the pit. 
Zech
9:12  “Return to the stronghold, you
prisoners of the expectation. Even today I declare that I return double to you.

Zech
9:13  “For I shall bend Yehuḏah for
Me, I shall fill the bow with Ephrayim, and I shall stir up your sons, O
Tsiyon, against your sons, O Greece, and I shall make you like the sword of a
mighty man.” 
Zech
9:14  And יהוה
shall appear for them, and His arrow go forth like lightning, and the Master יהוה
sound the ram’s horn. And He shall go with whirlwinds from the south, 
Zech
9:15  יהוה of
hosts shall shield them. And they shall devour and trample on sling stones. And
they shall drink, roar as if with wine, and they shall be filled like basins,
like the corners of the altar. 
Zech
9:16  And יהוה
their Elohim shall save them in that day, as the flock of His people, for the
stones of a diadem, sparkling over His land. 
Zech
9:17  For what goodness is His, and what
comeliness is His. Grain make the young men thrive, and new wine the maidens! 
Zech
10:1  Ask יהוה
for rain in the time of the latter rain, יהוה who makes
storm clouds. And He gives them showers of rain, the plants in the field to
everyone. 
Zech
10:2  For the household idols spoke
emptiness, the diviners saw falsehood, and relate dreams of deceit, they
comfort in vain. Therefore they have wandered about like sheep. They are
afflicted, for there is no shepherd.
Zech
10:3  “My wrath burns against the
shepherds, and I lay a charge against the leaders. For יהוה
of hosts shall visit His flock, the house of Yehuḏah, and make them like
His splendid horse in battle. 
Zech
10:4  “From him comes the corner-stone,
from him the tent peg, from him the battle bow, from him every ruler, together.

Zech
10:5  “And they shall be like mighty men,
who trample down the mud of the streets in the battle. And they shall fight
because יהוה is with them, and the riders on horses
shall be put to shame. 
Zech
10:6  “And I shall make the house of Yehuḏah
mighty, and save the house of Yosĕph. And I shall bring them back, because
I have compassion on them. And they shall be as though I had not pushed them
aside. For I am יהוה their Elohim, and I answer them. 
Zech
10:7  “And Ephrayim shall be as a mighty
man, and their heart shall rejoice as if with wine. And their children shall
see and rejoice, their heart exulting in יהוה. 
Zech
10:8  “I shall whistle for them and
gather them, for I shall ransom them. And they shall increase as they once
increased. 
Zech
10:9  “Though I sow them among peoples,
they shall remember Me in places far away. And they shall live, together with
their children, and they shall return. 
Zech
10:10  “And I shall bring them back from
the land of Mitsrayim, and gather them from Ashshur, and bring them into the
land of Gil‛aḏ and Leḇanon, until no more room is found for
them. 
Zech
10:11  “And He shall pass through the sea
of distress, and strike the waves of the sea, and all the depths of the River
shall dry up. And the pride of Ashshur shall be brought down, and the sceptre
of Mitsrayim be taken away. 
Zech
10:12  “And I shall make them mighty in יהוה,
so that they walk up and down in His Name,” declares יהוה.

Zech
11:1  Open your doors, O Leḇanon,
and let fire devour your cedars. 
Zech
11:2  Howl, O cypress, for the cedar has
fallen, because the mighty are ravaged. Howl, O oaks of Bashan, for the dense
forest has come down. 
Zech
11:3  Listen! The howling of shepherds,
for their splendour is ravaged. Listen! The roaring of lions, for the pride of
the Yardĕn is ravaged. 
Zech
11:4  Thus said יהוה
my Elohim, “Feed the flock for slaughter, 
Zech
11:5  whose owners slaughter them and
feel no guilt, and their sellers say, ‘Blessed be יהוה,
for I have become rich.’ And their own shepherds do not spare them. 
Zech
11:6  “For I shall no longer spare the
inhabitants of the land,” declares יהוה. “But see, I am
delivering up mankind, each one into his neighbour’s hand and into the hand of
his sovereign. And they shall crush the earth, but I do not deliver from their
hand.” 
Zech
11:7  So I shepherded the flock meant for
slaughter, the truly poor of the flock. And I took for myself two staffs, the
one I called Pleasantness, and the other I called Unity, and I shepherded the
flock. 
Zech
11:8  Then I sent off the three shepherds
in one month, for my being despised them, and their being also loathed me. 
Zech
11:9  So I said, “I am not shepherding
you. Let the dying die, and the straying stray, and let those who are left eat
each other’s flesh.” 
Zech
11:10  And I took my staff, Pleasantness,
and cut it in two, to break the covenant which I had made with all the peoples.

Zech
11:11  So it was broken on that day. And
the poor of the flock, who were watching me, knew that it was the word of יהוה.

Zech
11:12  And I said to them, “If it is good
in your eyes, give me my wages. And if not, refrain.” So they weighed out for
my wages thirty pieces of silver. 
Zech
11:13  And יהוה said
to me, “Throw it to the potter,” the splendid price at which I was valued by
them. And I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them into the House of יהוה
for the potter. 
Zech
11:14  Then I cut in two my other staff,
Unity, to break the brotherhood between Yehuḏah and Yisra’ĕl. 
Zech
11:15  And יהוה
said to me, “Take again the implements of a foolish shepherd. 
Zech
11:16  “For look, I am raising up a
shepherd in the land who does not visit those straying, nor seek the young, nor
heal those that are broken, nor feed those that still stand. But he does eat
the flesh of the fat and tear off their hooves. 
Zech
11:17  “Woe to the worthless shepherd
forsaking the flock! Let a sword be upon his arm and upon his right eye! His
arm shall wither and his right eye shall be dimmed.” 
Zech
12:1  The message of the word of יהוה
against Yisra’ĕl. יהוה, stretching out the
heavens, and laying the foundation of the earth, and forming the spirit of man
within him, declares, 
Zech
12:2  “See, I am making Yerushalayim a
cup of reeling to all the people all around, and also against Yehuḏah it
is in the siege against Yerushalayim. 
Zech
12:3  “And in that day it shall be that I
make Yerushalayim a very heavy stone for all peoples – all lifting it are
severely injured. And all the nations of the earth shall be gathered against
it. 
Zech
12:4  “In that day,” declares יהוה,
“I smite every horse with bewilderment and its rider with madness. And on the
house of Yehuḏah I open My eyes, but every horse of the peoples I smite
with blindness. 
Zech
12:5  “And the leaders of Yehuḏah
shall say in their heart, ‘The inhabitants of Yerushalayim are a strength to
me, through יהוה of hosts, their Elohim.’ 
Zech
12:6  “In that day I make the leaders of
Yehuḏah like a fire pot among trees, and like a torch of fire in the
sheaves. And they shall consume all the peoples all around, on the right and on
the left. And Yerushalayim shall dwell again in her own place, in Yerushalayim.

Zech
12:7  “And יהוה
shall save the tents of Yehuḏah first, so that the comeliness of the
house of Dawiḏ and the comeliness of the inhabitants of Yerushalayim
would not become greater than that of Yehuḏah. 
Zech
12:8  “In that day יהוה
shall shield the inhabitants of Yerushalayim. And the feeble among them in that
day shall be like Dawiḏ, and the house of Dawiḏ like Elohim, like
the Messenger of יהוה before them! 
Zech
12:9  “And it shall be in that day that I
seek to destroy all the gentiles that come against Yerushalayim. 
Zech
12:10  “And I shall pour on the house of
Dawiḏ and on the inhabitants of Yerushalayim a spirit of favour and
prayers. And they shall look on Me whom they pierced, and they shall mourn for
Him as one mourns for his only son. And they shall be in bitterness over Him as
a bitterness over the first-born. 
Zech
12:11  “In that day the mourning in
Yerushalayim is going to be great, like the mourning at Haḏaḏ
Rimmon in the valley of Meḡiddo. 
Zech
12:12  “And the land shall mourn, every
clan by itself: the clan of the house of Dawiḏ by itself, and their women
by themselves; the clan of the house of Nathan by itself, and their women by
themselves; 
Zech
12:13  the clan of the house of Lĕwi
by itself, and their women by themselves; the clan of Shim‛i by itself,
and their women by themselves; 
Zech
12:14  all the rest of the clans, every
clan by itself, and their women by themselves. 
Zech
13:1  “In that day a fountain shall be
opened for the house of Dawiḏ and for the inhabitants of Yerushalayim,
for sin and for uncleanness. 
Zech
13:2  “And it shall be in that day,”
declares יהוה of hosts, “that I cut off the names of
the idols from the earth, and they shall be remembered no more, and I shall
also remove the prophets and the unclean spirit from the earth.
Zech
13:3  “And it shall be, when one
prophesies again, then his father and mother who brought him forth shall say to
him, ‘You shall not to live, because you have spoken falsehood in the Name of יהוה.’
And his father and mother who brought him forth shall pierce him through when
he prophesies. 
Zech
13:4  “And it shall be in that day that
the prophets shall be ashamed, everyone of his vision when he prophesies, and
not put a hairy robe on in order to deceive, 
Zech
13:5  but shall say, ‘I am no prophet, I
am a farmer, for a man sold me as a slave in my youth.’ 
Zech
13:6  “And one shall say to him, ‘What
are these wounds in your hands?’ And he shall say, ‘Because I was wounded at
home by those who love me.’ 
Zech
13:7  “O sword, awake against My
Shepherd, against the Man who is My Companion,” declares יהוה
of hosts. “Smite the Shepherd, and let the sheep be scattered. But I shall turn
My hand upon the little ones. 
Zech
13:8  And it shall be throughout all the
soil,” declares יהוה, “that two thirds therein are cut
off and die, and one third is left therein. 
Zech
13:9  “And I shall bring the third into
fire, and refine them as silver is refined, and try them as gold is tried. They
shall call on My Name, and I shall answer them. I shall say, ‘This is My
people,’ while they say, ‘ יהוה is my Elohim.’ ”
Zech
14:1  See, a day shall come for יהוה,
and your spoil shall be divided in your midst. 
Zech
14:2  And I shall gather all the gentiles
to battle against Yerushalayim. And the city shall be taken, the houses
plundered, and the women ravished. Half of the city shall go into exile, but
the remnant of the people shall not be cut off from the city.
Zech
14:3  And יהוה
shall go forth, and He shall fight against those gentiles, as He fights in the
day of battle. 
Zech
14:4  And in that day His feet shall
stand upon the Mount of Olives, which faces Yerushalayim on the east. And the
Mount of Olives shall be split in two, from east to west, a very great valley,
and half of the mountain shall move toward the north and half of it toward the
south. 
Zech
14:5  And you shall flee to the valley of
My mountain – for the valley of the mountains reaches to Atsal. And you shall
flee as you fled from the earthquake in the days of Uzziyah sovereign of Yehuḏah.
And יהוה my Elohim shall come – all the set-apart ones
with You. 
Zech
14:6  And in that day it shall be: there
is no light, it is dark. 
Zech
14:7  And it shall be one day which is
known to יהוה, neither day nor night, but at evening
time there shall be light. 
Zech
14:8  And in that day it shall be that
living waters flow from Yerushalayim, half of them toward the eastern sea and
half of them toward the western sea, in summer as well as in winter.
Zech
14:9  And יהוה
shall be Sovereign over all the earth. In that day there shall be one יהוה,
and His Name one.
Zech
14:10  All the land shall be changed into
a desert plain from Geḇa to Rimmon south of Yerushalayim, and she shall
be raised up and inhabited in her place from Binyamin’s Gate to the place of
the First Gate and the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Ḥanan’ĕl
to the winepresses of the sovereign. 
Zech
14:11  And they shall dwell in her, and
there shall be no more utter destruction, but Yerushalayim shall be safely
inhabited.
Zech
14:12  And this is the plague with which יהוה
plagues all the people who fought against Yerushalayim: their flesh shall decay
while they stand on their feet, and their eyes decay in their sockets, and
their tongues decay in their mouths. 
Zech
14:13  And it shall be in that day that a
great confusion from יהוה is among them, and everyone
of them shall seize the hand of his neighbour, and his hand rise up against his
neighbour’s hand. 
Zech
14:14  And Yehuḏah shall fight at
Yerushalayim as well. And the wealth of all the gentiles round about shall be
gathered together: gold, and silver, and garments in great quantities. 
Zech
14:15  So also is the plague on the horse
and the mule, on the camel and the donkey, and on all the cattle that are in
those camps – as this plague. 
Zech
14:16  And it shall be that all who are
left from all the gentiles which came up against Yerushalayim, shall go up from
year to year to bow themselves to the Sovereign, יהוה
of hosts, and to observe the Festival of Booths. 
Zech
14:17  And it shall be, that if anyone of
the clans of the earth does not come up to Yerushalayim to bow himself to the
Sovereign, יהוה of hosts, on them there is to be no
rain. 
Zech
14:18  And if the clan of Mitsrayim does
not come up and enter in, then there is no rain.
On them is the plague with which יהוה plagues the
gentiles who do not come up to observe the Festival of Booths. 
Zech
14:19  This is the punishment of
Mitsrayim and the punishment of all the gentiles that do not come up to observe
the Festival of Booths. 
Zech
14:20  In that day “SET-APART TO יהוה
” shall be engraved on the bells of the horses. And the pots in the House of יהוה
shall be like the bowls before the altar. 
Zech
14:21  And every pot in Yerushalayim and
Yehuḏah shall be set-apart to יהוה of hosts. And
all those who slaughter shall come and take them and cook in them. And there
shall no longer be a merchant in the House of יהוה of
hosts, in that day.
