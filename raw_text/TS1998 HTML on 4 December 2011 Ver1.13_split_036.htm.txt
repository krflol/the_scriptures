Ezek
26:1  And it came to be in the eleventh
year, on the first of the month, the word of יהוה came
to me, saying, 
Ezek
26:2  “Son of man, because Tsor has
spoken against Yerushalayim, ‘Aha! She, the gateway of the peoples, has been
broken, she has been turned over to me. Let me be filled, she has been ruined.’

Ezek
26:3  “Therefore thus said the Master יהוה,
‘See, I am against you, O Tsor, and shall cause many nations to come up against
you, as the sea causes its waves to come up. 
Ezek
26:4  ‘And they shall destroy the walls
of Tsor, and they shall break down her towers. And I shall scrape her dust from
her, and shall make her like a shining rock. 
Ezek
26:5  ‘She shall be a place for spreading
nets in the midst of the sea, for I have spoken,’ declares the Master יהוה.
‘And she shall become plunder for the nations, 
Ezek
26:6  while her daughter villages which
are in the fields are slain by the sword. And they shall know that I am יהוה.’

Ezek
26:7  “For thus said the Master יהוה,
‘See, I am bringing against Tsor from the north Neḇuḵaḏretstsar
sovereign of Baḇel, a sovereign of sovereigns, with horses, and with
chariots, and with horsemen, even an assembly, and many people.
Ezek
26:8  ‘With the sword he shall slay your
daughter villages in the fields. And he shall heap up a siege mound against
you, and shall build a wall against you, and shall raise a large shield against
you, 
Ezek
26:9  and set the blow of his battering
rams against your walls, and break down your towers with his weapons. 
Ezek
26:10  ‘From his many horses, their dust
shall cover you. From the noise of the horsemen, and vehicles, and chariots,
your walls shall shake as he enters your gates, as men enter a city that is
breached. 
Ezek
26:11  ‘With the hooves of his horses he
tramples all your streets, he slays your people by the sword, and the columns
of your strength shall fall to the ground. 
Ezek
26:12  ‘And they shall plunder your
riches, and they shall loot your merchandise. And they shall break down your
walls and destroy your pleasant houses. And they shall put your stones, and
your timber, and your dust in the midst of the water. 
Ezek
26:13  ‘And I shall cause the sound of
your songs to cease, and let the sound of your lyres be heard no more. 
Ezek
26:14  ‘And I shall make you like a shining
rock, and let you be a place for spreading nets, never to be rebuilt, for I יהוה
have spoken,’ declares the Master יהוה. 
Ezek
26:15  “Thus said the Master יהוה
to Tsor, ‘Would the coastlands not shake at the sound of your fall, when the
wounded cry, when slaughter is made in your midst? 
Ezek
26:16  ‘And all the princes of the sea
shall come down from their thrones, and they shall lay aside their robes, and
take off their embroidered garments, and put on trembling, and sit on the
ground. And they shall tremble continuously, and they shall be astonished at
you. 
Ezek
26:17  ‘And they shall take up a
lamentation for you, and say to you, “How you have perished, O one inhabited by
seafaring men, the city well-praised, who was strong at sea, she and her inhabitants,
who put their fear on all her inhabitants! 
Ezek
26:18  Now the coastlands tremble on the
day of your fall! And the coastlands by the sea shall shudder at your going
out.” ’ 
Ezek
26:19  “For thus said the Master יהוה,
‘When I make you a ruined city, like cities no longer inhabited, when I bring
the deep upon you, and great waters cover you, 
Ezek
26:20  then I shall bring you down with
those who go down into the Pit, to the people of old. And I shall make you
dwell in the lowest part of the earth, in wastes of old, with those who go to
the Pit, so that you do not return. But I shall establish splendour in the land
of the living. 
Ezek
26:21  ‘I make you a horror, and let you
be no more. And you are sought for, but never found again,’ declares the Master
יהוה.” 
Ezek
27:1  The word of יהוה
came again to me, saying, 
Ezek
27:2  “Now, son of man, take up a
lamentation for Tsor, 
Ezek
27:3  and you shall say to Tsor, ‘You who
dwell at the entrance to the sea, merchant of the peoples on many coastlands, thus
said the Master יהוה, “O Tsor, you yourself have said, ‘I
am perfect in loveliness.’ 
Ezek
27:4  “Your borders are in the heart of
the seas. Your builders have perfected your loveliness. 
Ezek
27:5  “They have made all your timbers of
fir trees from Senir. They took a cedar from Leḇanon to make a mast for
you. 
Ezek
27:6  “From the oaks of Bashan they made
your oars. They made your deck with ivory from the coasts of Kittim. 
Ezek
27:7  “Of fine embroidered linen from
Mitsrayim was your sail to serve you as banner. Of blue and purple from the
coasts of Elishah was your covering. 
Ezek
27:8  “The inhabitants of Tsiḏon
and Arwaḏ were your seamen. Your wise men, O Tsor, were in you, they were
your sailors. 
Ezek
27:9  “The elders of Geḇal and its
wise men were in you repairing your seams. All the ships of the sea and their
seamen were in you to trade your merchandise. 
Ezek
27:10  “Those from Persia, Luḏ, and
Put were in your army as men of battle. Shield and helmet they hung up within
you, they gave splendour to you. 
Ezek
27:11  “The sons of Arwaḏ, and your
army were on your walls all around, and the Gammaḏites were in your
towers. They hung their shields on your walls all around, they perfected your
loveliness. 
Ezek
27:12  “Tarshish was your merchant
because of your great wealth. They gave you silver, iron, tin, and lead for
your merchandise. 
Ezek
27:13  “Yawan, Tuḇal, and Mesheḵ
were your traders. They exchanged slaves and objects of bronze for your merchandise.

Ezek
27:14  “Those from the house of Toḡarmah
exchanged horses, and horsemen, and mules for your merchandise. 
Ezek
27:15  “The men of Deḏan traded
with you. Many isles were your market, they brought you ivory tusks and ebony
as payment. 
Ezek
27:16  “Aram was your merchant because of
the multitude of your works. They gave you emeralds, purple, and embroidery,
and fine linen, and corals, and rubies for your wares. 
Ezek
27:17  “Yehuḏah and the land of
Yisra’ĕl were your traders. For your merchandise they exchanged wheat of
Minnith, and early figs, and honey, and oil, and balm. 
Ezek
27:18  “Damascus was your merchant
because of the multitude of your works, because of your great wealth of goods,
with the wine of Ḥelbon and with white wool. 
Ezek
27:19  “Weḏan and Yawan from Uzal
paid for your wares, they exchanged wrought iron, cassia, and cane for your
merchandise. 
Ezek
27:20  “Deḏan traded with you in
saddlecloths for riding. 
Ezek
27:21  “Araḇia, and all princes of
Qĕḏar, were merchants for you. In lambs, and rams, and goats they
were your merchants. 
Ezek
27:22  “The traders of Sheḇa and Ra‛mah
were your traders. They paid for your wares with the choicest spices, and all
kinds of precious stones, and gold. 
Ezek
27:23  “Ḥaran, and Kanneh, and Ĕḏen,
traders of Sheḇa, Ashshur, and Kilmaḏ traded with you. 
Ezek
27:24  “They traded with you in perfect
items, in purple clothes, in embroidered garments, in chests of multi-coloured
clothes, in strong twined cords, among your merchandise. 
Ezek
27:25  “The ships of Tarshish were the
travellers of your merchandise. And you were filled and richly laden in the
heart of the seas. 
Ezek
27:26  “Your seamen brought you into many
waters, but the east wind broke you in the heart of the seas. 
Ezek
27:27  “Your wealth, and your wares, your
merchandise, your mariners and your sailors, your repairers of seams, and your
dealers in merchandise, and all your fighting men who are in you, and the
entire company which is in your midst, shall go down into the heart of the seas
on the day of your fall, 
Ezek
27:28  the coasts shaking at the sound of
the cry of your sailors. 
Ezek
27:29  “And all the oarsmen, the
mariners, all the sailors of the sea shall come down from their ships. They
shall stand on the shore, 
Ezek
27:30  and they shall raise their voice
and cry bitterly over you, and cast dust on their heads, rolling themselves in
ashes. 
Ezek
27:31  “And they shall shave themselves
bald because of you, and shall gird themselves with sackcloth. And they shall
weep for you with bitterness of heart and bitter wailing. 
Ezek
27:32  “And in their wailing for you they
shall take up a lamentation. And they shall lament for you, ‘Who is cut off in
the midst of the sea like Tsor? 
Ezek
27:33  ‘When your wares went out by sea,
you have filled many peoples; with your great wealth and your merchandise you
have made the sovereigns of the earth rich. 
Ezek
27:34  ‘In the time you are broken by the
seas in the depths of the waters, your merchandise and all your company shall
fall in your midst. 
Ezek
27:35  ‘All the inhabitants of the isles
shall be astonished at you, and their sovereigns shall be greatly afraid, their
faces shall be troubled. 
Ezek
27:36  ‘The merchants among the peoples
shall whistle at you. You shall become a horror, and be no more, forever.’ ” ’ ”

Ezek
28:1  And the word of יהוה
came to me, saying, 
Ezek
28:2  “Son of man, say to the prince of
Tsor, ‘Thus said the Master יהוה, “Because your heart
is lifted up, and you say, ‘I am Ĕl, I sit in the seat of Elohim, in the
heart of the seas,’ whereas you are a man, and not Ĕl, though you set your
heart as the heart of Elohim!
Ezek
28:3  “Look, are you wiser than Dani’ĕl?
Has no secret been hidden from you? 
Ezek
28:4  “By your wisdom and your
understanding you have made riches for yourself, and gathered gold and silver
into your treasuries. 
Ezek
28:5  “By your great wisdom, by your
trade you have increased your riches, and your heart is lifted up because of
your riches.” 
Ezek
28:6  ‘Therefore thus said the Master יהוה,
“Because you have set your heart as the heart of Elohim, 
Ezek
28:7  therefore see, I am bringing
against you strangers, the ruthless ones of the nations. And they shall draw
their swords against the loveliness of your wisdom, and they shall profane your
splendour. 
Ezek
28:8  “Down into the Pit they shall bring
you, and you shall die the death of the slain in the heart of the seas. 
Ezek
28:9  “Would you still say before him who
slays you, ‘I am Elohim’, whereas you are man, and not Ĕl, in the hand of
him who slays you? 
Ezek
28:10  “The death of the uncircumcised
you shall die, by the hand of foreigners. For I have spoken,” declares the
Master יהוה.’ ” 
Ezek
28:11  And the word of יהוה
came to me, saying, 
Ezek
28:12  “Son of man, take up a lamentation
for the sovereign of Tsor, and you shall say to him, ‘Thus said the Master יהוה,
“You were sealing up a pattern, complete in wisdom and perfect in loveliness. 
Ezek
28:13  “You were in Ĕḏen, the
garden of Elohim. Every precious stone was your covering: the ruby, topaz, and
diamond, beryl, shoham, and jasper, sapphire, turquoise, and emerald and gold.
The workmanship of your settings and mountings was prepared for you on the day
you were created. 
Ezek
28:14  “You were the anointed keruḇ
that covered. And I placed you, you were on the set-apart mountain of Elohim.
You walked up and down in the midst of stones of fire. 
Ezek
28:15  “You were perfect in your ways
from the day you were created, until unrighteousness was found in you. 
Ezek
28:16  “By the greatness of your trade
you became filled with violence within, and you sinned. So I thrust you from
the mountain of Elohim, and I destroyed you, O covering keruḇ, from the
midst of the stones of fire. 
Ezek
28:17  “Your heart was lifted up because
of your loveliness, you corrupted your wisdom for the sake of your splendour. I
threw you to the earth, I laid you before sovereigns, to look at you. 
Ezek
28:18  “You profaned your set-apart
places by your many crookednesses, by the unrighteousness of your trading.
Therefore I brought forth fire from your midst. It has devoured you, and I
turned you to ashes upon the earth before the eyes of all who see you. 
Ezek
28:19  “All who knew you among the
peoples were astonished at you. Waste you shall be, and cease to be, forever.” ’
”
Ezek
28:20  And the word of יהוה
came to me, saying, 
Ezek
28:21  “Son of man, set your face toward
Tsiḏon, and prophesy against her, 
Ezek
28:22  and you shall say, ‘Thus said the
Master יהוה, “See, I am against you, O Tsiḏon,
and I shall be esteemed in your midst. And they shall know that I am יהוה,
when I execute judgments in her. And I shall be set-apart in her. 
Ezek
28:23  “And I shall send pestilence upon
her, and blood in her streets. And the slain shall fall in her midst by the
sword against her, from all sides. And they shall know that I am יהוה.

Ezek
28:24  “And there shall no longer be a
pricking brier or a paining thorn for the house of Yisra’ĕl from among all
who are around them, who despise them. And they shall know that I am the Master
יהוה.” 
Ezek
28:25  ‘Thus said the Master יהוה,
“When I have gathered the house of Yisra’ĕl from the peoples among whom
they are scattered, I shall be set-apart in them before the eyes of the
gentiles. And they shall dwell in their own land which I gave to My servant Ya‛aqoḇ.
Ezek
28:26  “And they shall dwell safely, and
build houses, and plant vineyards, and dwell safely, when I execute judgments
on all those around them who despise them. And they shall know that I am יהוה
their Elohim.” ’ ” 
Ezek
29:1  In the tenth year, in the tenth
month, on the twelfth of the month, the word of יהוה
came to me, saying, 
Ezek
29:2  “Son of man, set your face against
Pharaoh the sovereign of Mitsrayim, and prophesy against him, and against
Mitsrayim, all of it. 
Ezek
29:3  “Speak, and you shall say, ‘Thus
said the Master יהוה, “See, I am against you, O Pharaoh
sovereign of Mitsrayim, O great monster who lies in the midst of his rivers,
who has said, ‘My River is my own, and I, I have made it for myself.’ 
Ezek
29:4  “And I shall put hooks in your
jaws, and I shall make the fish of your rivers cling to your scales. And I
shall bring you up out of the midst of your rivers, and all the fish in your
rivers cling to your scales. 
Ezek
29:5  “And I shall leave you in the
wilderness, you and all the fish of your rivers. On the face of the field you
shall fall, and you shall not be picked up or gathered. I shall give you as
food to the beasts of the field and to the birds of the heavens. 
Ezek
29:6  “And all the inhabitants of
Mitsrayim shall know that I am יהוה, because they have
been a staff of reed to the house of Yisra’ĕl. 
Ezek
29:7  “When they grasped you with the
hand, you broke and tore all their shoulders. When they leaned on you, you broke
and made all their loins shake.” 
Ezek
29:8  ‘Therefore thus said the Master יהוה,
“See, I am bringing a sword upon you and shall cut off from you man and beast. 
Ezek
29:9  “And the land of Mitsrayim shall
become a desert and a waste. And they shall know that I am יהוה,
because he said, ‘The River is mine, and I have made it.’ 
Ezek
29:10  “Therefore see, I am against you
and against your rivers, and shall make the land of Mitsrayim an utter waste
and a desert, from Miḡdol to Sewĕnĕh, as far as the border of
Kush. 
Ezek
29:11  “No foot of man shall pass through
it, nor foot of beast pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited for forty
years. 
Ezek
29:12  “And I shall make the land of
Mitsrayim a desert in the midst of the lands that are waste. And among the
cities that are ruined, her cities shall be a waste forty years. And I shall
scatter the Mitsrites among the nations, and I shall disperse them throughout
the lands.” 
Ezek
29:13  ‘For thus said the Master יהוה,
“At the end of forty years I shall gather the Mitsrites from the peoples among
whom they were scattered. 
Ezek
29:14  “And I shall turn back the
captivity of Mitsrayim and I shall bring them back to the land of Pathros, to
the land of their birth, and there they shall be a lowly reign, 
Ezek
29:15  being the lowliest of reigns, and
never again exalt itself above the nations. And I shall make them few so as not
to rule over the nations. 
Ezek
29:16  “And no longer is it to be the
refuge of the house of Yisra’ĕl, bringing to remembrance their crookedness
when they turned to follow them. And they shall know that I am the Master יהוה.”
’ ” 
Ezek
29:17  And it came to be in the
twenty-seventh year, in the first month, on the first of the month, that the
word of יהוה came to me, saying, 
Ezek
29:18  “Son of man, Neḇuḵaḏretstsar
sovereign of Baḇel made his army to serve a great service against Tsor,
every head was made bald and every shoulder worn bare. But he and his army
received no reward from Tsor, for the service he served against it. 
Ezek
29:19  “Therefore thus said the Master יהוה,
‘See, I am giving the land of Mitsrayim to Neḇuḵaḏretstsar
sovereign of Baḇel. And he shall take away her wealth, take her spoil,
and remove her pillage. And it shall be a reward for his army. 
Ezek
29:20  ‘I have given him the land of
Mitsrayim as a reward for his labour, because they worked for Me,’ declares the
Master יהוה. 
Ezek
29:21  ‘In that day I shall make the horn
of the house of Yisra’ĕl to spring forth, while I open your mouth to speak
in their midst. And they shall know that I am יהוה.’ ” 
Ezek
30:1  And the word of יהוה
came to me, saying, 
Ezek
30:2  “Son of man, prophesy and say, ‘Thus
said the Master יהוה, “Howl, ‘Woe to the day!’ 
Ezek
30:3  “For the day is near, even the day
of יהוה is near. It is a day of clouds, the time of the
nations. 
Ezek
30:4  “The sword shall come upon
Mitsrayim, and great anguish shall be in Kush, when the slain fall in
Mitsrayim, and they take away her wealth, and her foundations are broken down. 
Ezek
30:5  “Kush, and Put, and Luḏ, all
the mixed people, and Kuḇ, and the sons of the land of the covenant,
shall fall with them by the sword.” 
Ezek
30:6  ‘Thus said יהוה,
“Those who lean on Mitsrayim shall fall, and the pride of her power shall come
down. From Miḡdol to Sewĕnĕh those within her shall fall by the
sword,” declares the Master יהוה. 
Ezek
30:7  “They shall be ruined amidst the
wasted lands, and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are dried
up. 
Ezek
30:8  “And they shall know that I am יהוה,
when I have set a fire in Mitsrayim and all her helpers are crushed. 
Ezek
30:9  “On that day messengers shall go
forth before Me in ships to make the complacent Kushites afraid, and great
anguish shall come upon them, as on the day of Mitsrayim – for look, it is
coming!” 
Ezek
30:10  ‘Thus said the Master יהוה,
“I shall cause the crowd of Mitsrayim to cease, by the hand of Neḇuḵaḏretstsar
sovereign of Baḇel. 
Ezek
30:11  “He and his people with him, the
ruthless ones of the nations, are brought to destroy the land. And they shall
draw their swords against Mitsrayim, and shall fill the land with the slain. 
Ezek
30:12  “And I shall make the rivers dry,
and I shall sell the land into the hand of evil ones. And I shall lay the land
waste, and all that is in it, by the hand of foreigners. I, יהוה,
have spoken.” 
Ezek
30:13  ‘Thus said the Master יהוה,
“And I shall destroy the idols, and make an end of the images in Noph, and
there shall no longer be a prince from the land of Mitsrayim, and I shall put
fear in the land of Mitsrayim. 
Ezek
30:14  “And I shall make Pathros a waste,
and I shall set fire to Tso‛an, and I shall execute judgments in No. 
Ezek
30:15  “And I shall pour out My wrath on
Sin, the stronghold of Mitsrayim. And I shall cut off the crowd of No. 
Ezek
30:16  “And I shall set a fire in
Mitsrayim, Sin shall writhe in anguish, No is to be split open, and Noph has
adversaries daily. 
Ezek
30:17  “The young men of Awen and Pi Ḇeseth
shall fall by the sword, while these cities go into captivity. 
Ezek
30:18  “And in Teḥaphneḥes
the day shall be darkened, when I shatter the yokes of Mitsrayim there. And the
pride of her strength shall cease in her, a cloud shall cover her. And her
daughters shall go into captivity. 
Ezek
30:19  “And I shall execute judgments on
Mitsrayim, and they shall know that I am יהוה.” ’ ”
Ezek
30:20  And it came to be in the eleventh
year, in the first month, on the seventh of the month, that the word of יהוה
came to me, saying, 
Ezek
30:21  “Son of man, I have broken the arm
of Pharaoh sovereign of Mitsrayim. And see, it has not been bound up for
healing, to put a bandage to bind it, to make it strong to hold a sword. 
Ezek
30:22  “Therefore thus said the Master יהוה,
‘See, I am against Pharaoh sovereign of Mitsrayim, and shall break his arms,
both the strong one and the one that was broken, and shall make the sword fall
out of his hand, 
Ezek
30:23  and shall scatter the Mitsrites
among the nations, and disperse them throughout the lands, 
Ezek
30:24  and strengthen the arms of the
sovereign of Baḇel. And I shall put My sword in his hand. And I shall
break Pharaoh’s arms, and he shall groan before him with the groanings of the
slain before him. 
Ezek
30:25  ‘And I shall strengthen the arms
of the sovereign of Baḇel, but the arms of Pharaoh shall fall. And they
shall know that I am יהוה, when I put My sword into the
hand of the sovereign of Baḇel and he shall stretch it out against the
land of Mitsrayim.  
Ezek
30:26  ‘And I shall scatter the Mitsrites
among the nations, and I shall disperse them throughout the lands. And they
shall know that I am יהוה.’ ” 
Ezek
31:1  And it came to be in the eleventh
year, in the third month, on the first of the month, that the word of יהוה
came to me, saying, 
Ezek
31:2  “Son of man, say to Pharaoh
sovereign of Mitsrayim and to his crowd, ‘To whom are you to be compared in
your greatness? 
Ezek
31:3  ‘See, Ashshur was a cedar in Leḇanon,
fair branches and forest shade, and of high stature. And its top was among the
thick foliage. 
Ezek
31:4  ‘The waters made him great, the
deep gave it height with its rivers running around its planting, and sent their
channels to all the trees of the field. 
Ezek
31:5  ‘Therefore its height was lifted up
above all the trees of the field, and its boughs were increased, and its
branches became long because of the many waters, as it sent them out. 
Ezek
31:6  ‘All the birds of the heavens made
their nests in its boughs, and under its branches all the beasts of the field
gave birth. And in its shadow all great nations dwelt. 
Ezek
31:7  ‘And it was fair in greatness and
in the length of its branches, for its roots reached to many waters. 
Ezek
31:8  ‘Cedars in the garden of Elohim did
not hide it, fir trees were not like its boughs, and the chestnut trees were
not like its branches. No tree in the garden of Elohim was as pretty as it. 
Ezek
31:9  ‘I made it pretty by its many
branches, so that all the trees of Ĕḏen which were in the garden of
Elohim were jealous of it.’ 
Ezek
31:10  “Therefore thus said the Master יהוה,
‘Because you have increased in height, and it set its top among the thick
foliage, and its heart was lifted up in its height, 
Ezek
31:11  ‘I give it into the hand of the
mighty one of the nations, and he shall certainly deal with it. I have driven
it out for its wrong. 
Ezek
31:12  ‘And foreigners, the most ruthless
of the nations, shall cut it down and leave it. Its branches shall fall on the
mountains and in all the valleys, its boughs lie broken by all the rivers of
the land. And all the peoples of the earth shall come out from under its shadow
and leave it. 
Ezek
31:13  ‘On its ruin shall dwell all the
birds of the heavens, and all the beasts of the field shall be on its fallen branches, 
Ezek
31:14  so that none of the trees by the
waters would exalt themselves because of their height, nor set their tops among
the thick foliage, and that no tree which drinks water would ever be high
enough to reach up to them. ‘For all of them shall be given up to death, to the
depths of the earth, among the children of men who go down to the Pit.’ 
Ezek
31:15  “Thus said the Master יהוה,
‘In the day when it is brought down to the grave I shall cause mourning. I
shall cover the deep because of it and hold back its streams, and many waters
shall be confined. And I shall make Leḇanon mourn for it, and all the
trees of the field shall wither away because of it. 
Ezek
31:16  ‘I shall make the nations shake at
the sound of its fall, when I bring it down to the grave together with those
who descend into the Pit. And all the trees of Ĕḏen, the choice and
best of Leḇanon, all that drink water, shall be comforted in the depths
of the earth. 
Ezek
31:17  ‘They too shall go down to the
grave with it, with those slain by the sword. And those who were its strength
shall dwell in its shadows among the nations. 
Ezek
31:18  ‘To whom are you to be compared in
esteem and greatness among the trees in Ĕḏen? But you shall be
brought down with the trees of Ĕḏen to the depths of the earth, lie
in the midst of the uncircumcised, with those slain by the sword. This is
Pharaoh and all his crowd,’ declares the Master יהוה.” 
Ezek
32:1  And it came to be in the twelfth
year, in the twelfth month, on the first of the month, that the word of יהוה
came to me, saying, 
Ezek
32:2  “Son of man, take up a lamentation
for Pharaoh sovereign of Mitsrayim, and you shall say to him, ‘You were like a
young lion among the nations, and you are like a monster in the seas, and you
burst forth in your rivers, and trouble the waters with your feet, and muddy
their rivers.’ 
Ezek
32:3  “Thus said the Master יהוה,
‘And I shall spread My net over you with an assembly of many peoples, and they
shall bring you up in My net. 
Ezek
32:4  ‘And I shall leave you on the land,
hurl you out on the open fields, and make all the birds of the heavens dwell on
you. And with you I shall satisfy the beasts of all the earth. 
Ezek
32:5  ‘And I shall put your flesh on the
mountains, and fill the valleys with your height, 
Ezek
32:6  and water the land with the flow of
your blood unto the mountains, and let streams be filled with you. 
Ezek
32:7  ‘And when I extinguish you, I shall
cover the heavens, and make its stars dark. I shall cover the sun with a cloud,
and the moon shall not give her light. 
Ezek
32:8  ‘All the bright lights of the
heavens I shall make dark over you, and I shall bring darkness upon your land,’
declares the Master יהוה. 
Ezek
32:9  ‘And I shall trouble the hearts of
many peoples, when I bring your destruction among the nations, into the lands
which you have not known. 
Ezek
32:10  ‘And I shall make many peoples
appalled at you, and their sovereigns shall be greatly afraid of you when I
swing My sword before them. And they shall tremble continually, every man for
his own life, in the day of your fall.’ 
Ezek
32:11  “For thus said the Master יהוה,
‘The sword of the sovereign of Baḇel shall come upon you. 
Ezek
32:12  ‘By the swords of the mighty men,
all of them the ruthless ones of the nations, I shall make your host fall. And
they shall ravage the arrogance of Mitsrayim, and all its host shall be
destroyed. 
Ezek
32:13  ‘And I shall destroy all its
beasts from beside its great waters, and let the foot of man trouble them no
more, nor let the hooves of beasts trouble them. 
Ezek
32:14  ‘Then I shall make their waters
clear, and make their rivers run like oil,’ declares the Master יהוה.

Ezek
32:15  ‘When I lay the land of Mitsrayim
waste, and the land shall be stripped of all that once filled it, when I have
smitten all who dwell in it, then they shall know that I am יהוה.

Ezek
32:16  ‘This is the lamentation, and they
shall lament her, the daughters of the nations lament her. Over Mitsrayim and
over all her crowd they shall lament her,’ declares the Master יהוה.”

Ezek
32:17  And it came to be in the twelfth
year, on the fifteenth of the month, that the word of יהוה
came to me, saying, 
Ezek
32:18  “Son of man, wail over the crowd
of Mitsrayim, and send them down to the depths of the earth, her and the
daughters of the mighty nations, with those going down to the Pit. 
Ezek
32:19  ‘Are you more pleasant than
others? Go down, be placed with the uncircumcised.’ 
Ezek
32:20  “In the midst of those slain by
the sword they fall. She shall be given to the sword, drawing her and all her
crowds. 
Ezek
32:21  “The mightiest among the mighty
speak to him out of the midst of the grave with those who help him, ‘They have
gone down, they lie with the uncircumcised, slain by the sword.’ 
Ezek
32:22  “Ashshur is there, and all her
assembly, with their graves all around her, all of them slain, fallen by the
sword, 
Ezek
32:23  whose graves are set in the sides
of the Pit, and her assembly is all around her grave, all of them slain, fallen
by the sword, because they instilled fear in the land of the living. 
Ezek
32:24  “There is Ĕylam and all her
crowd, around her grave, all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who have gone
down uncircumcised to the lower parts of the earth, because they instilled fear
in the land of the living. And they bear their shame with those going down to
the Pit. 
Ezek
32:25  “They have set her bed in the
midst of the slain, with all her crowd, with her graves all around it, all of
them uncircumcised, slain by the sword, for the fear they instilled in the land
of the living. So they bear their shame with those going down to the Pit. In
the midst of the slain they have been placed. 
Ezek
32:26  “There are Mesheḵ and Tuḇal
and all her crowd, with all their graves around it, all of them uncircumcised,
slain by the sword, because they instilled fear in the land of the living. 
Ezek
32:27  “And they shall not lie with the
mighty who are fallen of the uncircumcised, who have gone down to the grave
with their battle gear, and whose swords were laid under their heads. But their
crookednesses are on their bones, because of the fear of the mighty in the land
of the living. 
Ezek
32:28  “And you shall be broken in the
midst of the uncircumcised, and lie with those slain by the sword. 
Ezek
32:29  “There is Eḏom, her
sovereigns and all her princes, who shall be given up in their might, with
those slain by the sword. With the uncircumcised they lie, and with those going
down to the Pit. 
Ezek
32:30  “There are the princes of the
north, all of them, and all the Tsiḏonians, who have gone down with the
slain, because of the fear they instilled. They are ashamed of their might. And
they lie uncircumcised with those slain by the sword, and bear their shame with
those going down to the Pit. 
Ezek
32:31  “Pharaoh – Pharaoh and all his
army – shall see them, and he shall be comforted for all his host that were
slain by the sword,” declares the Master יהוה. 
Ezek
32:32  “For I have put a fear of him in
the land of the living, yet he shall be placed in the midst of the
uncircumcised with those slain by the sword – Pharaoh and all his host,”
declares the Master יהוה. 
Ezek
33:1  And the word of יהוה
came to me, saying, 
Ezek
33:2  “Son of man, speak to the children
of your people, and you shall say to them, ‘When I bring the sword upon a land,
and the people of the land shall take a man from their borders and shall make
him their watchman, 
Ezek
33:3  and he sees the sword coming upon
the land, and shall blow the ram’s horn and shall warn the people, 
Ezek
33:4  then whoever shall hear the sound
of the ram’s horn and shall not take warning, if the sword comes and takes him
away, his blood is on his own head. 
Ezek
33:5  ‘He heard the sound of the ram’s
horn, but he did not take warning, his blood is on himself. But he who takes
warning shall deliver his being. 
Ezek
33:6  ‘But if the watchman sees the sword
coming and shall not blow the ram’s horn, and the people shall not be warned,
and the sword comes and takes any being from among them, he is taken away in
his crookedness, and his blood I require at the watchman’s hand.’ 
Ezek
33:7  “And you, son of man, I have made
you a watchman for the house of Yisra’ĕl. And you shall hear a word from
My mouth and you shall warn them for Me. 
Ezek
33:8  “When I say to the wrong, ‘O wrong
one, you shall certainly die!’ and you have not spoken to warn the wrong from
his way, that wrong one shall die in his crookedness, and his blood I require
at your hand. 
Ezek
33:9  “But when you have warnedthe wrong
to turn from his way, and he has not turned from his way, he shall die in his
crookedness, but you have delivered your being.
Ezek
33:10  “And you, O son of man, say to the
house of Yisra’ĕl, ‘This is what you have said, “If our transgressions and
our sins lie upon us, and we pine away in them, how then shall we live?” ’ 
Ezek
33:11  “Say to them, ‘As I live,’
declares the Master יהוה, ‘I have no pleasure in the
death of the wrong, but that the wrong turn from his way and live. Turn back,
turn back from your evil ways! For why should you die, O house of Yisra’ĕl?’

Ezek
33:12  “And you, O son of man, say to the
children of your people, ‘The righteousness of the righteous man shall not
deliver him in the day of his transgression. And as for the wrongness of the
wrong, he shall not stumble because of it in the day that he turns from his
wrong. And the righteous shall not be able to live because of his righteousness
in the day that he sins.’ 
Ezek
33:13  “When I say to the righteous that
he shall live, and he has trusted in his righteousness, and shall do
unrighteousness, none of his righteousness shall be remembered, but because of
his unrighteousness that he has done, he shall die. 
Ezek
33:14  “Again, when I say to the wrong, ‘You
shall certainly die,’ if he turns from his sin and does right and
righteousness, 
Ezek
33:15  if the wrong restores the pledge,
gives back what he has stolen, and walks in the laws of life without doing
crookedness, he shall certainly live; he shall not die. 
Ezek
33:16  “None of his sins which he has
committed shall be remembered against him – he has done right and
righteousness; he shall certainly live. 
Ezek
33:17  “And the children of your people
have said, ‘The way of יהוה is not fair.’ But it is
their way which is not fair! 
Ezek
33:18  “When the righteous turns from his
righteousness and does unrighteousness, he shall die because of it. 
Ezek
33:19  “But when the wrong turns from his
wrongness and does right and righteousness, he shall live because of it. 
Ezek
33:20  “And you have said, ‘The way of יהוה
is not fair.’ O house of Yisra’ĕl, I shall judge every one of you
according to his own ways.” 
Ezek
33:21  And it came to be in the twelfth
year of our exile, in the tenth month, on the fifth of the month, that one who
had escaped from Yerushalayim came to me and said, “The city has been smitten!”

Ezek
33:22  And the hand of יהוה
came upon me the evening before the man came who had escaped. And He had opened
my mouth, before he came to me in the morning. And my mouth was opened. And I
was no longer silent. 
Ezek
33:23  Then the word of יהוה
came to me, saying, 
Ezek
33:24  “Son of man, they who inhabit
those ruins in the land of Yisra’ĕl are saying, ‘Aḇraham was only
one, and he inherited the land. But we are many, let the land be given to us as
a possession.’ 
Ezek
33:25  “Therefore say to them, ‘Thus said
the Master יהוה, “You eat meat with blood, and you lift
up your eyes toward your idols, and shed blood. Should you then possess the
land? 
Ezek
33:26  “You depend on your sword, and you
commit abominations, and each of you defiles his neighbour’s wife. Should you
then possess the land?” ’ 
Ezek
33:27  “Say this to them, ‘Thus said the
Master יהוה, “As I live, those who are in the ruins
shall fall by the sword, and the one who is in the open field I shall give to
the beasts to be devoured, and those who are in the strongholds and caves shall
die of the pestilence. 
Ezek
33:28  “And I shall make the land a
desert and a waste, the arrogance of her strength shall cease, and the
mountains of Yisra’ĕl shall be a waste, with none passing through. 
Ezek
33:29  “And they shall know that I am יהוה,
when I have made the land a desert and a waste, because of all their
abominations which they have done.” ’ 
Ezek
33:30  “As for you, son of man, the
children of your people are talking about you beside the walls and in the doors
of the houses. And they speak to each other, each saying to his brother, ‘Please
come and hear what the word is that comes from יהוה.’ 
Ezek
33:31  “And they come to you as people
do, and they sit before you as My people, and they hear your words, but they do
not do them. For with their mouth they show much love – their hearts pursue
their greedy gain. 
Ezek
33:32  “And see, you are to them as a
very lovely song of one who has a pleasant voice and playing well on an
instrument. And they hear your words, but they do not do them. 
Ezek
33:33  “And when it comes – see, it shall
come – then they shall know that a prophet has been in their midst.” 
Ezek
34:1  And the word of יהוה
came to me, saying, 
Ezek
34:2  “Son of man, prophesy against the
shepherds of Yisra’ĕl, prophesy and say to them, ‘Thus said the Master יהוה
to the shepherds, “Woe to the shepherds of Yisra’ĕl who have been feeding
themselves! Should not the shepherds feed the flock?
Ezek
34:3  “You eat the fat and you put on the
wool. You slaughter the fatlings – you do not feed the flock. 
Ezek
34:4  “You have not strengthened the
weak, nor have you healed the sick, nor bound up the broken, nor brought back
the straying, nor sought what was lost; but you have ruled them with might and
harshness. 
Ezek
34:5  “And they were scattered because
there was no shepherd. And they became food for all the beasts of the field
when they were scattered. 
Ezek
34:6  “My sheep wandered through all the
mountains, and on every high hill. And My sheep were scattered over all the
face of the earth, and no one was seeking or searching for them.” 
Ezek
34:7  ‘Therefore, you shepherds, hear the
word of יהוה : 
Ezek
34:8  “As I live,” declares the Master יהוה,
“because My flock became a prey, and My flock became food for every beast of
the field, from not having a shepherd, and My shepherds did not search for My
flock, but the shepherds fed themselves and did not feed My flock,” 
Ezek
34:9  therefore, O shepherds, hear the word
of יהוה ! 
Ezek
34:10  ‘Thus said the Master יהוה,
“See, I am against the shepherds, and shall require My flock at their hand, and
shall make them cease feeding the sheep, and the shepherds shall feed
themselves no more. And I shall deliver My flock from their mouths, and they
shall no longer be food for them.” 
Ezek
34:11  ‘For thus said the Master יהוה,
“See, I Myself shall search for My sheep and seek them out. 
Ezek
34:12  “As a shepherd seeks out his flock
on the day he is among his scattered sheep, so I shall seek out My sheep and
deliver them from all the places where they were scattered in a day of cloud
and thick darkness. 
Ezek
34:13  “And I shall bring them out from
the peoples and gather them from the lands, and shall bring them to their own
land. And I shall feed them on the mountains of Yisra’ĕl, in the valleys,
and in all the dwellings of the land. 
Ezek
34:14  “In good pasture I shall feed
them, and their fold shall be on the high mountains of Yisra’ĕl. They
shall lie there in a good fold and feed in rich pasture on the mountains of
Yisra’ĕl. 
Ezek
34:15  “I shall feed My flock and make
them lie down,” declares the Master יהוה. 
Ezek
34:16  “I shall seek out the lost and
bring back the strayed. And I shall bind up the broken and strengthen what was
sick, but the fat and the strong I shall destroy. I shall feed them with
right-ruling.” 
Ezek
34:17  ‘And as for you, O My flock, thus
said the Master יהוה, “See, I am judging between sheep
and sheep, between rams and goats. 
Ezek
34:18  “Is it not enough for you to have
eaten up the good pasture, and the rest of your pasture you trample with your
feet. Or that you should drink of the clear waters, and the rest you muddy with
your feet? 
Ezek
34:19  “And as for My flock, they eat
what you have trampled with your feet, and they drink what you have muddied
with your feet.” 
Ezek
34:20  ‘Therefore thus said the Master יהוה
to them, “See, I Myself shall judge between fat and lean sheep. 
Ezek
34:21  “Because you have pushed with
flank and shoulder, and thrust at all the weak ones with your horns, and
scattered them abroad, 
Ezek
34:22  therefore I shall save My flock,
and let them no longer be a prey. And I shall judge between sheep and sheep. 
Ezek
34:23  “And I shall raise up over them
one shepherd, My servant Dawiḏ, and he shall feed them. He shall feed
them and be their shepherd. 
Ezek
34:24  “And I, יהוה,
shall be their Elohim, and My servant Dawiḏ a prince in their midst. I, יהוה,
have spoken. 
Ezek
34:25  “And I shall make a covenant of
peace with them, and make evil beasts cease from the land. And they shall dwell
safely in the wilderness and sleep in the forest. 
Ezek
34:26  “And I shall make them and the
places all around My hill a blessing, and shall cause showers to come down in
their season – showers of blessing they are. 
Ezek
34:27  “And the trees of the field shall
yield their fruit and the earth yield her increase, and they shall be safe in
their land. And they shall know that I am יהוה, when I
have broken the bars of their yoke. And I shall deliver them from the hand of
those who enslaved them, 
Ezek
34:28  and they shall no longer be a prey
for the gentiles, and the beast of the earth shall not devour them. And they
shall dwell safely, with no one to make them afraid. 
Ezek
34:29  “And I shall raise up for them a
planting place of name, and they shall no longer be consumed by hunger in the
land, nor bear the shame of the gentiles any more. 
Ezek
34:30  “And they shall know that I, יהוה
their Elohim, am with them, and that they, the house of Yisra’ĕl, are My
people,” declares the Master יהוה.’ ” 
Ezek
34:31  “And you, My flock, the flock of
My pasture, are men, and I am your Elohim,” declares the Master יהוה.’
” 
Ezek
35:1  And the word of יהוה
came to me, saying, 
Ezek
35:2  “Son of man, set your face against
Mount Sĕ‛ir and prophesy against it, 
Ezek
35:3  and you shall say to it, ‘Thus said
the Master יהוה, “See, O Mount Sĕ‛ir, I am
against you, and shall stretch out My hand against you, and shall make you a
ruin and a waste. 
Ezek
35:4  “Your cities I destroy, and let you
be a ruin. And you shall know that I am יהוה. 
Ezek
35:5  “Because you have had a continuous
enmity, and handed the children of Yisra’ĕl over to the power of the sword
at the time of their calamity, at the time of the crookedness of the end. 
Ezek
35:6  “Therefore, as I live,” declares
the Master יהוה, “I shall appoint you for blood, and
let blood pursue you. Since you did not hate blood, therefore blood shall
pursue you. 
Ezek
35:7  “And I shall make Mount Sĕ‛ir
a ruin and a waste, and cut off from it the one who leaves and the one who
returns, 
Ezek
35:8  and shall fill its mountains with
the slain, those slain by the sword falling on your hills and in your valleys
and in all your ravines. 
Ezek
35:9  “I shall make you an everlasting
ruin, and your cities uninhabited. And you shall know that I am יהוה.

Ezek
35:10  “Because you have said, ‘These two
nations and these two lands are mine, and we shall possess them,’ although יהוה
was there, 
Ezek
35:11  therefore, as I live,” declares
the Master יהוה, “I shall do according to your
displeasure and according to your envy which you showed in your hatred against
them. And I shall make Myself known among them when I judge you. 
Ezek
35:12  “And you shall know that I am יהוה.
I have heard all your scorns which you have spoken against the mountains of
Yisra’ĕl, saying, ‘They are laid waste, they were given to us for food.’ 
Ezek
35:13  “And with your mouth you have
boasted against Me and increased your words against Me – I Myself have heard.” 
Ezek
35:14  ‘Thus said the Master יהוה,
“As all the earth is rejoicing I shall make you a ruin. 
Ezek
35:15  “As you rejoiced because the
inheritance of the house of Yisra’ĕl was laid waste, so I do to you: be a
ruin, O Mount Sĕ‛ir, as well as all of Eḏom, all of it! And
they shall know that I am יהוה.” ’ 
Ezek
36:1  “And you, son of man, prophesy to
the mountains of Yisra’ĕl, and you shall say, ‘O mountains of Yisra’ĕl,
hear the word of יהוה ! 
Ezek
36:2  ‘Thus said the Master יהוה,
“Because the enemy has said of you, ‘Aha! The heights of old have become our
possession,’ ” ’ 
Ezek
36:3  therefore prophesy, and you shall
say, ‘Thus said the Master יהוה, “Because they laid you
waste and swallowed you up on every side, so that you became the possession of
the rest of the gentiles, and you are taken up by the lips of talkers and
slandered by the people,” 
Ezek
36:4  therefore, O mountains of Yisra’ĕl,
hear the word of the Master יהוה ! Thus said the Master
יהוה to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers,
and to the valleys, and to the deserted ruins, and to the cities that have been
forsaken, which became a prey and a mocking to the rest of the gentiles all
around; 
Ezek
36:5  therefore thus said the Master יהוה,
“Have I not spoken in My burning jealousy against the rest of the gentiles and
against all Eḏom, who gave My land to themselves as a possession, with
all joy of heart, with scorn in their being, to drive it out for a prey?” ’ 
Ezek
36:6  “Therefore prophesy concerning the
land of Yisra’ĕl, and you shall say to mountains, and to hills, to rivers,
and to valleys, ‘Thus said the Master יהוה, “See, I
have spoken in My jealousy and My wrath, because you have borne the shame of
the gentiles.” 
Ezek
36:7  ‘Therefore thus said the Master יהוה,
“I have lifted My hand in an oath that the gentiles that are around you shall
bear their own shame. 
Ezek
36:8  “But you, O mountains of Yisra’ĕl,
put forth your branches and bear your fruit to My people Yisra’ĕl, for
they are about to come! 
Ezek
36:9  “For look, I am for you, and I
shall turn to you, and you shall be tilled and sown. 
Ezek
36:10  “And I shall increase men upon
you, all the house of Yisra’ĕl, all of it. And the cities shall be
inhabited and the ruins rebuilt. 
Ezek
36:11  “And I shall increase upon you man
and beast, and they shall increase and bear young. And I shall make you
inhabited as of old, and do better for you than at your beginnings. And you
shall know that I am יהוה. 
Ezek
36:12  “And I shall let men, My people
Yisra’ĕl, walk upon you, and let them possess you, and you shall be their
inheritance, and no longer let you add to their bereavement.” 
Ezek
36:13  ‘Thus said the Master יהוה,
“Because they say to you, ‘You devour men and have bereaved your nation,’ 
Ezek
36:14  therefore you shall no longer
devour men, and no longer bereave your nation,” declares the Master יהוה.

Ezek
36:15  “And no longer shall I let you
hear the insults of the gentiles. And the reproach of the peoples you shall
bear no more, and no longer cause your nations to stumble,” declares the Master
יהוה.’ ” 
Ezek
36:16  And the word of יהוה
came to me, saying, 
Ezek
36:17  “Son of man, when the house of
Yisra’ĕl dwelt in their own land, they defiled it by their own ways and
deeds. To Me their way was like the uncleanness of a woman in her monthly
period. 
Ezek
36:18  “So I poured out My wrath on them
for the blood they had shed on the land, and for their idols they defiled it. 
Ezek
36:19  “And I scattered them among the
gentiles, and they were dispersed throughout the lands. I have judged them
according to their ways and their deeds. 
Ezek
36:20  “And when they came to the
gentiles, wherever they went, they profaned My set-apart Name for it was said
of them, ‘These are the people of יהוה, and yet they
have gone out of His land.’ 
Ezek
36:21  “But I had compassion on My
set-apart Name, which the house of Yisra’ĕl had profaned among the
gentiles wherever they went. 
Ezek
36:22  “Therefore say to the house of
Yisra’ĕl, ‘Thus said the Master יהוה, “I do not do
this for your sake, O house of Yisra’ĕl, but for My set-apart Name’s sake,
which you have profaned among the gentiles wherever you went. 
Ezek
36:23  “And I shall set apart My great
Name, which has been profaned among the gentiles, which you have profaned in
their midst. And the gentiles shall know that I am יהוה,”
declares the Master יהוה, “when I am set-apart in you
before their eyes. 
Ezek
36:24  “And I shall take you from among
the gentiles, and I shall gather you out of all lands, and I shall bring you
into your own land. 
Ezek
36:25  “And I shall sprinkle clean water
on you, and you shall be clean – from all your filthiness and from all your
idols I cleanse you. 
Ezek
36:26  “And I shall give you a new heart
and put a new spirit within you. And I shall take the heart of stone out of
your flesh, and I shall give you a heart of flesh, 
Ezek
36:27  and put My Spirit within you. And
I shall cause you to walk in My laws and guard My right-rulings and shall do
them.
Ezek
36:28  “And you shall dwell in the land
that I gave to your fathers. And you shall be My people, and I shall be your
Elohim. 
Ezek
36:29  “And I shall save you from all
your uncleannesses. And I shall call for the grain and increase it, and I shall
bring no scarcity of food upon you. 
Ezek
36:30  “And I shall increase the fruit of
your trees and the increase of your fields, so that you need never again bear
the reproach of scarcity of food among the gentiles. 
Ezek
36:31  “And you shall remember your evil
ways and your deeds that were not good. And you shall loathe yourselves in your
own eyes, for your crookednesses and your abominations. 
Ezek
36:32  “Not for your sake am I acting,”
declares the Master יהוה, “let it be known to you. Be
ashamed and blush for your ways, O house of Yisra’ĕl!” 
Ezek
36:33  ‘Thus said the Master יהוה,
“On the day that I cleanse you from all your crookednesses, I shall cause the
cities to be inhabited, and the ruined places shall be rebuilt, 
Ezek
36:34  and the land that was laid waste tilled
instead of being a ruin before the eyes of all who pass by. 
Ezek
36:35  “And they shall say, ‘This land
that was laid waste has become like the garden of Ĕḏen. And the
wasted, the deserted, and the destroyed cities are now walled and inhabited.’ 
Ezek
36:36  “Then the gentiles which are left
all around you shall know that I, יהוה, have rebuilt
the destroyed places and planted what was laid waste. I, יהוה,
have spoken it, and I shall do it.” 
Ezek
36:37  ‘Thus said the Master יהוה,
“Once again I shall let the house of Yisra’ĕl inquire of Me to do for
them: I shall increase their men like a flock. 
Ezek
36:38  “As a set-apart flock, as the
flock at Yerushalayim at her appointed times, so shall the wasted cities be
filled with flocks of men. And they shall know that I am יהוה.”
’ ” 
Ezek
37:1  The hand of יהוה
was upon me and took me out by the Spirit of יהוה, and
set me down in the midst of the valley. And it was filled with bones. 
Ezek
37:2  And He made me pass among them, all
around, and see, there were very many on the surface of the valley, and see,
they were very dry. 
Ezek
37:3  And He said to me, “Son of man,
would these bones live?” And I said, “O Master יהוה,
You know.” 
Ezek
37:4  Again He said to me, “Prophesy to
these bones, and you shall say to them, ‘O dry bones, hear the word of יהוה
! 
Ezek
37:5  ‘Thus said the Master יהוה
to these bones, “See, I am bringing into you a spirit, and you shall live. 
Ezek
37:6  “And I shall put sinews on you and
bring flesh upon you, and cover you with skin and put a spirit in you, and you
shall live. And you shall know that I am יהוה.” ’ ”
Ezek
37:7  And I prophesied as I was
commanded. And as I prophesied, there was a noise, and there was a rattling.
And the bones came together, bone to bone. 
Ezek
37:8  And I looked and saw sinews and
flesh came upon them, and skin covered them, but there was no spirit in them. 
Ezek
37:9  He then said to me, “Prophesy to
the spirit, prophesy, son of man, and you shall say to the spirit, ‘Thus said
the Master יהוה, “Come from the four winds, O spirit,
and breathe on these slain, so that they live.” ’ ” 
Ezek
37:10  And I prophesied as He commanded
me, and the spirit came into them, and they lived, and stood upon their feet, a
very great army. 
Ezek
37:11  And He said to me, “Son of man,
these bones are all the house of Yisra’ĕl. See, they say, ‘Our bones are
dry, our expectancy has perished, and we ourselves have been cut off!’ 
Ezek
37:12  “Therefore prophesy, and you shall
say to them, ‘Thus said the Master יהוה, “See, O My people,
I am opening your graves, and shall bring you up from your graves, and shall
bring you into the land of Yisra’ĕl. 
Ezek
37:13  “And you shall know that I am יהוה,
when I open your graves, O My people, and bring you up from your graves. 
Ezek
37:14  “And I shall put My Spirit in you,
and you shall live, and I shall settle you in your own land. And you shall know
that I יהוה have spoken, and I have done it,” declares יהוה.’
” 
Ezek
37:15  And the word of יהוה
came to me, saying, 
Ezek
37:16  “And you, son of man, take a stick
for yourself and write on it, ‘For Yehuḏah and for the children of Yisra’ĕl,
his companions.’ Then take another stick and write on it, ‘For Yosĕph, the
stick of Ephrayim, and for all the house of Yisra’ĕl, his companions.’ 
Ezek
37:17  “Then bring them together for
yourself into one stick, and they shall become one in your hand. 
Ezek
37:18  “And when the children of your
people speak to you, saying, ‘Won’t you show us what you mean by these?’
Ezek
37:19  say to them, ‘Thus said the Master
יהוה, “See, I am taking the stick of Yosĕph, which
is in the hand of Ephrayim, and the tribes of Yisra’ĕl, his companions.
And I shall give them unto him, with the stick of Yehuḏah, and make them
one stick, and they shall be one in My hand.” ’ 
Ezek
37:20  “And the sticks on which you write
shall be in your hand before their eyes. 
Ezek
37:21  “And speak to them, ‘Thus said the
Master יהוה, “See, I am taking the children of Yisra’ĕl
from among the gentiles, wherever they have gone, and shall gather them from
all around, and I shall bring them into their land. 
Ezek
37:22  “And I shall make them one nation
in the land, on the mountains of Yisra’ĕl. And one sovereign shall be
sovereign over them all, and let them no longer be two nations, and let them no
longer be divided into two reigns. 
Ezek
37:23  “And they shall no longer defile
themselves with their idols, nor with their disgusting matters, nor with any of their transgressions. And I shall save
them from all their dwelling places in which they have sinned, and I shall
cleanse them. And they shall be My people, and I be their Elohim, 
Ezek
37:24  while Dawiḏ My servant is
sovereign over them. And they shall all have one shepherd and walk in My
right-rulings and guard My laws, and shall do them. 
Ezek
37:25  “And they shall dwell in the land
that I have given to Ya‛aqoḇ My servant, where your fathers dwelt.
And they shall dwell in it, they and their children and their children’s
children, forever, and My servant Dawiḏ be their prince forever.
Ezek
37:26  “And I shall make a covenant of
peace with them – an everlasting covenant it is with them. And I shall place
them and increase them, and shall place My set-apart place in their midst,
forever. 
Ezek
37:27  “And My Dwelling Place shall be over
them. And I shall be their Elohim, and they shall be My people. 
Ezek
37:28  “And the gentiles shall know that
I, יהוה, am setting Yisra’ĕl apart, when My
set-apart place is in their midst – forever.” ’ ”
Ezek
38:1  And the word of יהוה
came to me, saying, 
Ezek
38:2  “Son of man, set your face against
Goḡ, of the land of Maḡoḡ, the prince of Rosh, Mesheḵ,
and Tuḇal, and prophesy against him. 
Ezek
38:3  “And you shall say, ‘Thus says the
Master יהוה, “See, I am against you, O Goḡ, the
prince of Rosh, Mesheḵ, and Tuḇal. 
Ezek
38:4  “And I shall turn you around, and I
shall put hooks into your jaws, and shall lead you out, with all your army,
horses and horsemen, clad perfectly, a great assembly with armour and shields,
all of them handling swords. 
Ezek
38:5  “Persia, Kush, and Put are with
them, all of them with shield and helmet, 
Ezek
38:6  “Gomer and all its bands, the house
of Toḡarmah from the far north and all its bands, many peoples with you. 
Ezek
38:7  “Be ready, prepare yourself, you
and all your assemblies that are assembled unto you. And you shall be a guard
for them. 
Ezek
38:8  “After many days you shall be
called up. In the latter years you shall come into the land of those brought
back from the sword and gathered from many people on the mountains of Yisra’ĕl,
which had been a continual waste. But they were brought out of the gentiles,
and all of them shall dwell safely. 
Ezek
38:9  “And you shall go up, coming like a
storm, covering the land like a cloud, you and all your bands and many peoples
with you.” 
Ezek
38:10  ‘Thus said the Master יהוה,
“And it shall be in that day that words arise in your heart, and you shall
devise an evil plan: 
Ezek
38:11  “And you shall say, ‘Let me go up
against a land of unwalled villages, let me go to those at rest who dwell
safely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither bars nor gates,’

Ezek
38:12  to take plunder and to take booty,
to stretch out your hand against the waste places that are again inhabited, and
against a people gathered from the gentiles, acquiring livestock and goods, who
dwell in the middle of the land. 
Ezek
38:13  “Sheḇa, and Deḏan, and
the merchants of Tarshish, and all their young lions shall say to you, ‘Have
you come to take plunder? Have you gathered your army to take booty, to bear
away silver and gold, to take away livestock and goods, to take great plunder?’
” ’ 
Ezek
38:14  “Therefore, son of man, prophesy,
and you shall say to Goḡ, ‘Thus said the Master יהוה,
“In that day when My people Yisra’ĕl dwell safely, would you not know? 
Ezek
38:15  “And you shall come from your
place out of the far north, you and many peoples with you, all of them riding
on horses, a great assembly and a mighty army. 
Ezek
38:16  “And you shall come up against My
people Yisra’ĕl like a cloud, to cover the land – in the latter days it
shall be. And I shall bring you against My land, in order that the gentiles
know Me, when I am set apart in you, O Goḡ, before their eyes.” 
Ezek
38:17  ‘Thus said the Master יהוה,
“Are you the one I spoke of in former days by My servants the prophets of Yisra’ĕl,
who prophesied for years in those days, to bring you against them? 
Ezek
38:18  “And it shall be on that day, on
the day when Goḡ comes against the land of Yisra’ĕl,” declares the
Master יהוה, “that My wrath shall come up in My face. 
Ezek
38:19  “For in My jealousy and in the
fire of My wrath I have spoken, ‘On that day there shall be a great shaking in
the land of Yisra’ĕl, 
Ezek
38:20  so that the fish of the sea, and
the birds of the heavens, and the beasts of the field, and all creeping
creatures that creep on the earth, and all men who are on the face of the earth
shall shake at My presence. And the mountains shall be thrown down, and the
steep places shall fall, and every wall fall to the ground.’ 
Ezek
38:21  “And I shall call for a sword
against Goḡ on all My mountains,” declares the Master יהוה,
“the sword of each one being against his brother. 
Ezek
38:22  “And I shall judge him with
pestilence and blood, and rain down flooding rain and hailstones, fire and
sulphur, on him and on his bands and on the many peoples who are with him. 
Ezek
38:23  “And I shall exalt Myself and set
Myself apart, and I shall be known in the eyes of many nations. And they shall
know that I am יהוה.” ’ 
Ezek
39:1  “And you, son of man, prophesy
against Goḡ, and you shall say, ‘Thus said the Master יהוה,
“See, I am against you, O Goḡ, the prince of Rosh, Mesheḵ, and Tuḇal,

Ezek
39:2  and shall turn you around and lead
you on, and bring you up from the uttermost parts of the north, and bring you
against the mountains of Yisra’ĕl, 
Ezek
39:3  and shall smite the bow out of your
left hand, and make the arrows fall from your right hand. 
Ezek
39:4  “On the mountains of Yisra’ĕl
you shall fall, you and all your bands and the peoples who are with you. To the
birds of prey of every sort and to the beasts of the field I shall give you for
food. 
Ezek
39:5  “On the face of the field you shall
fall, for I have spoken,” declares the Master יהוה. 
Ezek
39:6  “And I shall send fire upon Maḡoḡ
and on those who live undisturbed in the coastlands. And they shall know that I
am יהוה. 
Ezek
39:7  “And I shall make My set-apart Name
known in the midst of My people Yisra’ĕl, and not let My set-apart Name be
profaned any more. And the gentiles shall know that I am יהוה,
the Set-apart One in Yisra’ĕl. 
Ezek
39:8  “See, it shall come, and it shall
be done,” declares the Master יהוה. “This is the day of
which I have spoken. 
Ezek
39:9  “And those who inhabit the cities
of Yisra’ĕl shall go out and set on fire and burn the weapons, both the
shields and armour, the bows and arrows, the clubs and spears. And they shall
make fires with them for seven years, 
Ezek
39:10  and take no wood from the field
nor cut down any from the forests, for with the weapons they make fire. And
they shall plunder those who plundered them, and loot those who looted them,”
declares the Master יהוה. 
Ezek
39:11  “And it shall be on that day that
I give Goḡ a burial site there in Yisra’ĕl, the valley of those
passing by east of the sea, and stopping those passing by, because there they
shall bury Goḡ and all his crowd, and shall call it the Valley of Hamon
Goḡ. 
Ezek
39:12  “And the house of Yisra’ĕl
shall bury them for seven months, in order to cleanse the land. 
Ezek
39:13  “And all the people of the land
shall bury them, and it shall be for a name to them on the day that I am
esteemed,” declares the Master יהוה. 
Ezek
39:14  “And they shall separate men who
continually pass through the land, burying those who were passing through,
those left on the surface of the ground, in order to cleanse it. At the end of
seven months they shall search, 
Ezek
39:15  and those passing through shall
pass through the land, and when anyone sees a man’s bone, he shall set up a
sign beside it, till the buriers have buried it in the Valley of Hamon Goḡ.

Ezek
39:16  “And also a city named Hamonah
shall be there. So they shall cleanse the land.” ’ 
Ezek
39:17  “And you, son of man, thus said
the Master יהוה, ‘Speak to every sort of bird and to
every beast of the field, “Assemble yourselves and come, gather from all around
to My offering which I am slaughtering for you, a great offering on the
mountains of Yisra’ĕl, and you shall eat flesh and drink blood. 
Ezek
39:18  “Eat the flesh of the mighty,
drink the blood of the princes of the earth, of rams and lambs, of goats and
bulls, all of them fatlings of Bashan. 
Ezek
39:19  “And you shall eat fat till you
are filled, and drink blood till you are drunk, at My offering which I am
slaughtering for you. 
Ezek
39:20  “And you shall be satisfied at My
table with horses and riders, with mighty men and with all the men of battle,”
declares the Master יהוה. 
Ezek
39:21  “And I shall set My esteem among
the gentiles. And all gentiles shall see My judgment which I have executed, and
My hand which I have laid on them. 
Ezek
39:22  “And the house of Yisra’ĕl
shall know that I am יהוה their Elohim from that day
onward. 
Ezek
39:23  “And the gentiles shall know that
the house of Yisra’ĕl went into exile for their crookedness, because they
have trespassed against Me, so that I hid My face from them, and I gave them
into the hand of their adversaries, and they all fell by the sword. 
Ezek
39:24  “According to their uncleanness
and according to their transgressions I have dealt with them, and hidden My
face from them.” ’ 
Ezek
39:25  “Therefore thus said the Master יהוה,
‘Now I am going to bring back the captives of Ya‛aqoḇ. And I shall
have compassion on all the house of Yisra’ĕl, and shall be jealous for My
set-apart Name. 
Ezek
39:26  ‘And they shall have borne their
shame, and all their trespass they committed against Me, when they dwell safely
in their own land, with none to make them afraid, 
Ezek
39:27  when I have brought them back from
the peoples and gathered them out of the lands of their enemies. And I shall be
set apart in them before the eyes of many gentiles.
Ezek
39:28  ‘And they shall know that I am יהוה
their Elohim, who sent them into exile among the gentiles, and then gathered
them back to their own land, and left none of them behind. 
Ezek
39:29  ‘And no longer do I hide My face
from them, for I shall have poured out My Spirit on the house of Yisra’ĕl,’
declares the Master יהוה.” 
Ezek
40:1  In the twenty-fifth year of our
exile, at the beginning of the year, on the tenth of the month, in the
fourteenth year after the city was smitten, on that same day the hand of יהוה
came upon me and He brought me there. 
Ezek
40:2  In visions of Elohim He brought me
into the land of Yisra’ĕl and set me on a very high mountain, and upon it
toward the south was as the structure of a city. 
Ezek
40:3  So He brought me there, and look, a
man whose appearance was like the appearance of bronze, and a line of flax and
a measuring rod in his hand, and he stood in the gateway. 
Ezek
40:4  And the man said to me, “Son of
man, see with your eyes and hear with your ears, and set your heart on all that
I am showing you, for you were brought here in order to show them to you.
Declare to the house of Yisra’ĕl all that you are seeing.” 
Ezek
40:5  And look: a wall all around the
outside of the House, and in the man’s hand a measuring rod six cubits long,
each being a cubit and a handbreadth. And he measured the width of the wall
structure, one rod, and the height one rod. 
Ezek
40:6  Then he came to the gate facing
east. And he went up its stairs and measured the threshold of the gate, one rod
wide, and the other threshold, one rod wide, 
Ezek
40:7  and the little room one rod long
and one rod wide, and between the little rooms a space of five cubits. And the

40:9  And he measured the porch of the
gate, eight cubits, and its posts two cubits. And the porch of the gate was on
the inside. 
Ezek
40:10  And the little rooms of the east
gate three on one side and three on the other, all three of the same size. And
posts were of the same size on this side and that side.

40:11  And he measured the width of the
entrance of the gate, ten cubits, and the length of the gate thirteen cubits.

40:16  And there were narrowed window
frames in the little rooms and to their posts at the inside of the gate all
around, and for the porches too. And there were windows all around on the
inside. And on each post were palm trees. 
Ezek
40:17  And he brought me into the outer
courtyard, and look, rooms and a pavement made all around the courtyard, thirty
rooms on the pavement. 
Ezek
40:18  And the pavement was by the side
of the gates, equal to the length of the gates – the lower pavement. 
Ezek
40:19  And he measured the width from the
front of the lower gate to the front of the inner courtyard on the outside, one
hundred cubits toward the east and the north. 
Ezek
40:20  And the gate of the outer

Ezek
40:21  And its little rooms, three on
this side and three on that side, its posts and its porches, had the same
measurements as the first gate, its length was fifty cubits and its width
twenty-five cubits. 
Ezek
40:22  And its windows and its porches,

went up to it by seven steps, and its porch was in front of it. 
Ezek
40:23  And the gate of the inner
courtyard was opposite the northern gate, and at the eastern gate. And he
measured from gate to gate, one hundred cubits.

Ezek
40:27  And the inner courtyard had a gate

the north gate and facing south, and the other at the side of the south gate
facing north. 
Ezek
40:45  And he said to me, “This room
facing south is for the priests who guard the duty of the House. 
Ezek
40:46  “And the room facing north is for

winding upwards for the side rooms, for the winding around the House went up
like steps. And the width of the structure increased as one went up from the

even to the inner house, as well as outside, and on every wall all around, inside
and outside, by measure. 
Ezek
41:18  And it was made with keruḇim
and palm trees, and a palm tree between keruḇ and keruḇ. A keruḇ
had two faces, 
Ezek
41:19  so that the face of a man was
toward a palm tree on one side, and the face of a young lion toward a palm tree
on the other side – made on all the House all around. 
Ezek
41:20  From the floor to the space above
the door, and on the wall of the Hĕḵal, keruḇim and palm trees
were carved. 
Ezek
41:21  The doorposts of the Hĕḵal
were square, and the front of the set-apart place, the appearance of one was
like the appearance of the other. 
Ezek
41:22  The altar was of wood, three
cubits high, and its length two cubits. And its corners, and its length, and
its sides were of wood. And he said to me, “This is the table that is before יהוה.”

Ezek
41:23  And the Hĕḵal and the
set-apart place had two doors. 
Ezek
41:24  And each of the doors had two
panels, two folding panels, two panels for one door and two panels for the
other door. 
Ezek
41:25  And keruḇim and palm trees
were carved on the doors of the Hĕḵal, like those carved on the
walls. And thick wood was on the front of the porch outside. 
Ezek
41:26  And narrowed window frames and
palm trees were on one side and on the other, on the sides of the porch, and on
the side rooms of the House, and thick wood. 
Ezek
42:1  And he brought me out into the
outer courtyard, the way toward the north. And he brought me into the room
which was opposite the separate place, and which was opposite the building to
the north. 
Ezek
42:2  Along the length which was one
hundred cubits, was the north door, the width was fifty cubits. 
Ezek
42:3  Opposite the inner courtyard of
twenty cubits, and opposite the
pavement of the outer courtyard, gallery against gallery in three levels. 
Ezek
42:4  And before the rooms, toward the
inside, was a walk ten cubits wide, a way of one cubit. And their doors were to
the north. 
Ezek
42:5  And the upper rooms were shorter,
because the galleries took away space from them more than from the lower and
middle levels of the building. 
Ezek
42:6  For they were in three levels and had no columns like the
columns of the courtyards, so the upper level
was set back more than the lower and middle levels
from the ground up. 
Ezek
42:7  As for the outer wall by the side
of the rooms, toward the outer courtyard facing the rooms, its length was fifty
cubits. 
Ezek
42:8  For the length of the rooms toward
the outer courtyard was fifty cubits, and that facing the Hĕḵal was
one hundred cubits. 
Ezek
42:9  And below these rooms was the
entrance on the east side, as one enters them from the outer courtyard. 
Ezek
42:10  In the thickness of the wall of
the courtyard toward the east, opposite the separate place and opposite the
building, were rooms. 
Ezek
42:11  And the way in front of them was
like the appearance of the rooms which were toward the north, as long and as
wide as the others, and all their exits and entrances were according to plan. 
Ezek
42:12  And according to the doors of the
rooms that were toward the south, there was a door in front of the way, the way
in front of the wall toward the east, as one enters them. 
Ezek
42:13  And he said to me, “The north
rooms and the south rooms, which are opposite the separate place, are the
set-apart rooms where the priests who approach יהוה eat
the most set-apart offerings. There they place the most set-apart items, and the grain offering, and the
sin offering, and the guilt offering, for the place is set-apart. 
Ezek
42:14  “When the priests enter, they are
not to go out of the set-apart room into the outer courtyard, but leave their
garments in which they attend there, for they are set-apart, and shall put on
other garments and shall draw near to that which is for the people.” 
Ezek
42:15  And when he had ended measuring
the inner House, he brought me out through the gate that faces east, and
measured it all around. 
Ezek
42:16  He measured the east side with the
measuring rod, five hundred rods by the measuring rod all around. 
Ezek
42:17  He measured the north side, five
hundred rods by the measuring rod all around. 
Ezek
42:18  He measured the south side, five
hundred rods by the measuring rod. 
Ezek
42:19  He turned round to the west side
and measured five hundred rods by the measuring rod. 
Ezek
42:20  On the four sides he measured it.
It had a wall all around, five hundred cubits
long and five hundred wide, to separate the set-apart places from the common. 
Ezek
43:1  And he led me to the gate, the gate
facing east. 
Ezek
43:2  And see, the esteem of the Elohim
of Yisra’ĕl came from the way of the east. And His voice was like the
sound of many waters, and the earth shone from His esteem. 
Ezek
43:3  And it was like the appearance of
the vision which I saw, like the vision which I saw when He came to destroy the
city. And the visions were like the vision which I saw by the River Keḇar,
and I fell on my face. 
Ezek
43:4  And the esteem of יהוה
came into the House by way of the gate facing east. 
Ezek
43:5  And the Spirit took me up and
brought me into the inner courtyard. And see, the esteem of יהוה
filled the House. 
Ezek
43:6  And I heard someone speaking to me
from the House, while a man stood beside me. 
Ezek
43:7  And He said to me, “Son of man,
this is the place of My throne and the place of the soles of My feet, when I
dwell in the midst of the children of Yisra’ĕl forever, and the house of
Yisra’ĕl shall no longer defile My set-apart Name, they nor their
sovereigns, by their whoring and by the corpses of their sovereigns on their
high places. 
Ezek
43:8  “When they placed their threshold
by My threshold, and their doorpost by My doorpost, with a wall between them
and Me, they defiled My set-apart Name by the abominations which they have
done. So I consumed them in My displeasure. 
Ezek
43:9  “Now let them put their whoring and
the corpses of their sovereigns far away from Me, and I shall dwell in their
midst forever. 
Ezek
43:10  “Son of man, explain the House to
the house of Yisra’ĕl, and when they are ashamed of their crookednesses,
they shall measure the measurements. 
Ezek
43:11  “And since they shall be ashamed
of all that they did, make known to them the design of the House and its
structure, and its exits and its entrances, its entire design and all its laws,
and all its forms and all its Torot. And write it down before their eyes, so
that they observe its entire design and all its laws, and shall do them. 
Ezek
43:12  “This is the Torah of the House:
Upon the mountaintop, all the boundary of it, all around, is most set-apart.
See, this is the Torah of the House. 
Ezek
43:13  “And these are the measurements of
the altar in cubits, that cubit being one cubit and a handbreadth, and the base
one cubit high and one cubit wide, with a rim all around its edge of one span.
And this is the upper part of the altar. 
Ezek
43:14  “And from the base on the ground
to the lower ledge, two cubits, and the width of the ledge one cubit, and from
the smaller ledge to the larger ledge four cubits, and the width of the ledge
one cubit.
Ezek
43:15  “And the altar hearth is four cubits
high, and four horns extending upward from the hearth. 
Ezek
43:16  “And the altar hearth is twelve
cubits long, and twelve wide, square at its four corners. 
Ezek
43:17  “And the ledge is fourteen long
and fourteen wide on its four sides, with a rim of half a cubit around it, and
its base one cubit all around, and its steps face east.” 
Ezek
43:18  And He said to me, “Son of man,
thus said the Master יהוה, ‘These are the laws for the
altar on the day when it is made, for offering burnt offerings on it, and for
sprinkling blood on it. 
Ezek
43:19  ‘And you shall give a young bull
for a sin offering to the priests, the Lĕwites, who are of the seed of Tsaḏoq,
who approach unto Me,’ declares the Master יהוה. 
Ezek
43:20  ‘And you shall take some of its
blood and put it on the four horns of the altar, on the four corners of the
ledge, and on the rim around it, and shall cleanse it and make atonement for
it. 
Ezek
43:21  ‘And you shall take the bull of
the sin offering, and shall burn it in the appointed place of the House,
outside the set-apart place. 
Ezek
43:22  ‘And on the second day you bring a
male goat, a perfect one, for a sin offering. And they shall cleanse the altar,
as they cleansed it with the bull. 
Ezek
43:23  ‘When you have ended cleansing it,
bring a young bull, a perfect one, and a ram from the flock, a perfect one. 
Ezek
43:24  ‘And you shall bring them before יהוה,
and the priests shall throw salt on them and offer them up as a burnt offering
to יהוה. 
Ezek
43:25  ‘Prepare a goat for a sin offering
daily for seven days, and prepare a young bull and a ram from the flock,
perfect ones. 
Ezek
43:26  ‘For seven days they shall make
atonement for the altar and cleanse it, and ordain it. 
Ezek
43:27  ‘And when these days are completed
it shall be, on the eighth day and thereafter, that the priests make your burnt
offerings and your peace offerings on the altar, and I shall accept you,’
declares the Master יהוה.” 
Ezek
44:1  And He brought me back to the outer
gate of the set-apart place which faces east, and it was shut. 
Ezek
44:2  And יהוה
said to me, “This gate is shut, it is not opened, and no one enters it, because
יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl has entered by it, and it
shall be shut. 
Ezek
44:3  “The prince, as prince, he sits in
it to eat bread before יהוה, coming in by way of the
porch of the gate, and going out the same way.” 
Ezek
44:4  And He brought me by way of the
north gate to the front of the House. And I looked and saw the esteem of יהוה
filled the House of יהוה, and I fell on my face. 
Ezek
44:5  And יהוה
said to me, “Son of man, set your heart and see with your eyes and hear with
your ears, all that I say to you concerning all the laws of the House of יהוה
and all its Torot. And you shall set your heart to the entrance of the house,
with all the exits of the set-apart place, 
Ezek
44:6  and shall say to the rebellious, to
the house of Yisra’ĕl, ‘Thus said the Master יהוה,
“O house of Yisra’ĕl, enough of all these abominations of yours, 
Ezek
44:7  that you brought in sons of a foreigner,
uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in My set-apart place
to profane it, My house! That you brought near My food, the fat and the blood,
and you broke My covenant because of all your abominations. 
Ezek
44:8  “And you did not guard the charge
of that which is set-apart to Me, but you have set others to guard the charge
of My set-apart place for you.” 
Ezek
44:9  ‘Thus said the Master יהוה,
“No son of a foreigner, uncircumcised in heart or uncircumcised in flesh, comes
into My set-apart place, even any son of a foreigner who is among the children
of Yisra’ĕl. 
Ezek
44:10  “And the Lĕwites who went far
from Me, when Yisra’ĕl went astray, who strayed away from Me after their
idols, they shall bear their crookedness. 
Ezek
44:11  “And they were attendants in My
set-apart place, as gatekeepers of the house and attendants of the house,
slaughtering the burnt offering and the offering for the people, and standing
before them to attend to them. 
Ezek
44:12  “Because they attended to them
before their idols and became a stumbling-block of crookedness to the house of
Yisra’ĕl, therefore I have lifted My hand in an oath against them,”
declares the Master יהוה, “that they shall bear their
crookedness, 
Ezek
44:13  and not come near Me to serve as
My priest, nor come near any of that which is set-apart to Me, nor into the
Most Set-apart Place. And they shall bear their shame and their abominations
which they have done. 
Ezek
44:14  “Yet I shall make them those who
guard the duty of the House, for all its work, and for all that has to be done
in it. 
Ezek
44:15  “But the priests, the Lĕwites,
the sons of Tsaḏoq, who guarded the duty of My set-apart place when the
children of Yisra’ĕl went astray from Me, they shall draw near to Me to
serve Me, and shall stand before Me to bring to Me the fat and the blood,”
declares the Master יהוה. 
Ezek
44:16  “They shall enter My set-apart
place, and they shall draw near to My table to serve Me, and they shall guard
My charge. 
Ezek
44:17  “And it shall be, when they enter
the gates of the inner courtyard, that they put on linen garments, and no wool
shall come upon them while they attend within the gates of the inner courtyard
or within the house. 
Ezek
44:18  “They shall have linen turbans on
their heads and linen trousers on their bodies, they shall not gird themselves
with sweat. 
Ezek
44:19  “And when they go out to the outer
courtyard, to the outer courtyard to the people, they shall take off their
garments in which they have attended, and shall leave them in the set-apart
rooms, and shall put on other garments. And they shall set apart the people in
their set-apart garments. 
Ezek
44:20  “And their heads they shall not
shave, nor shall they let their hair grow long – they shall keep their hair
well trimmed. 
Ezek
44:21  “And no priest is to drink wine
when he comes into the inner court. 
Ezek
44:22  “And they do not take as wife a
widow or a divorced woman, but take maidens of the seed of the house of Yisra’ĕl,
or widows of priests. 
Ezek
44:23  “And they are to teach My people
the difference between the set-apart
and the profane, and make them know what is unclean and clean. 
Ezek
44:24  “And they are to stand as judges
in a dispute, and judge it according to My right-rulings. And they are to guard
My Torot and My laws in all My appointed festivals, and set apart My Sabbaths. 
Ezek
44:25  “And they are not to defile
themselves by coming near a dead man. Only for a father or mother, for a son or
daughter, for a brother or unmarried sister they defile themselves. 
Ezek
44:26  “And after his cleansing, they
count seven days for him, 
Ezek
44:27  and on the day that he comes into
the inner court of the set-apart place to attend in the set-apart place, he
brings his sin offering,” declares the Master יהוה. 
Ezek
44:28  “And it shall be to them for an
inheritance, I am their inheritance. And you give them no possession in Yisra’ĕl
– I am their possession. 
Ezek
44:29  “The grain offering, and the sin
offering, and the guilt offering they are to eat, and all that is dedicated in
Yisra’ĕl is theirs. 
Ezek
44:30  “And the first of all the
first-fruits of all, and every contribution of all, of all your contributions,
belong to the priests. And the first of your ground meal you give to the
priest, so that a blessing rests on your house. 
Ezek
44:31  “The priests are not to eat any
bird or beast found dead or torn to pieces. 
Ezek
45:1  “And when you divide the land by
lot into inheritance, offer a contribution to יהוה, a
set-apart portion of the land, in length twenty-five thousand cubits long, and in width ten thousand,
this being set-apart throughout its border all around. 
Ezek
45:2  “Of this a square plot is to be for
the set-apart place, five hundred by five hundred, with fifty cubits around it
for an open space. 
Ezek
45:3  “And from this measure you are to
measure: twenty-five thousand cubits
long and ten thousand wide. And in it is to be the set-apart place, the Most
Set-apart Place. 
Ezek
45:4  “This is to be a set-apart portion
of the land, belonging to the priests, the attendants of the set-apart place,
who draw near to serve יהוה. And it shall be a place
for their houses and set-apart ground for the set-apart place. 
Ezek
45:5  “And twenty-five thousand cubits in length and ten thousand in
width is for the Lĕwites, the attendants of the House, for them for a
possession, twenty rooms. 
Ezek
45:6  “And give the city as possession:
five thousand cubits wide and
twenty-five thousand long, beside the contribution of the set-apart portion –
it belongs to all the house of Yisra’ĕl. 
Ezek
45:7  “And the prince is to have a
portion on one side and the other of the set-apart contribution and of the
possession of the city. And bordering on the set-apart contribution and the
possession of the city, on the west side westward and on the east side
eastward, and the length alongside one of the portions, from the west border to
the east border. 
Ezek
45:8  “Of the land this is his possession
in Yisra’ĕl, and My princes shall no longer oppress My people. And they
shall give the land to the house of Yisra’ĕl, according to their tribes.” 
Ezek
45:9  ‘Thus said the Master יהוה,
“Enough, you princes of Yisra’ĕl! Put away violence and plundering, and do
right-ruling and righteousness, and stop your evictions of My people,” declares
the Master יהוה. 
Ezek
45:10  “Have right scales, and a right ĕphah,
and a right bath. 
Ezek
45:11  “Let the ĕphah and the bath
be of the same measure, so that the bath contains one-tenth of a ḥomer,
and the ĕphah one-tenth of a ḥomer. Let their measure be according
to the ḥomer. 
Ezek
45:12  “And the sheqel is twenty gĕrahs.
Your mina is twenty sheqels, twenty-five sheqels, fifteen sheqels. 
Ezek
45:13  “This is the contribution which
you present: you shall give one-sixth of an ĕphah from a ḥomer of
wheat, and one-sixth of an ĕphah from a ḥomer of barley. 
Ezek
45:14  “And the law concerning oil, the
bath of oil, is one-tenth of a bath from a kor. A kor is a ḥomer or ten
baths, for ten baths are a ḥomer. 
Ezek
45:15  “And one lamb from a flock, from
two hundred, from the watered pastures of Yisra’ĕl, for grain offerings,
and for a burnt offering, and for peace offerings, to make atonement for them,”
declares the Master יהוה. 
Ezek
45:16  “All the people of the land are to
give this contribution to the prince in Yisra’ĕl. 
Ezek
45:17  “And on the prince are the burnt
offerings, and the grain offerings, and drink offerings, at the festival, the
New Moons, the Sabbaths – in all the appointed times of the house of Yisra’ĕl.
He is to prepare the sin offering, and the grain offering, and the burnt
offering, and the peace offerings to make atonement for the house of Yisra’ĕl.”

Ezek
45:18  ‘Thus said the Master יהוה,
“In the first month, on the first of the month, you are to take a young bull, a
perfect one, and shall cleanse the set-apart place. 
Ezek
45:19  “And the priest shall take some of
the blood of the sin offering and put it on the doorposts of the House, on the
four corners of the ledge of the altar, and on the posts of the gate of the
inner courtyard. 
Ezek
45:20  “And do the same on the seventh of
the month for anyone who makes a mistake or is foolish. And you shall make
atonement for the House. 
Ezek
45:21  “In the first month, on the
fourteenth day of the month, you have the Passover, a festival of seven days,
unleavened bread is eaten. 
Ezek
45:22  “And on that day the prince shall
prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bull for a sin
offering. 
Ezek
45:23  “And during the seven days of the festival he prepares a burnt offering
to יהוה, seven bulls and seven rams, perfect ones,
daily for seven days, and a male goat daily for a sin offering. 
Ezek
45:24  “And he prepares a grain offering
of one ĕphah for each bull and one ĕphah for each ram, together with
a hin of oil for each ĕphah. 
Ezek
45:25  “In the seventh month, on the
fifteenth day of the month, at the festival, he prepares like these seven days,
as the sin offering, as the burnt offering, as the grain offering, and as the
oil.” 
Ezek
46:1  ‘Thus said the Master יהוה,
“The gate of the inner courtyard facing east is shut the six days of work, but
on the Sabbath it is opened, and on the day of the New Moon it is opened. 
Ezek
46:2  “And the prince shall enter by way
of the porch of that gate from the outside, and he shall stand by the post. And
the priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings. And he
shall bow himself at the threshold of the gate, and shall go out, but the gate
is not shut until evening. 
Ezek
46:3  “And the people of the land shall
also bow themselves at the entrance to this gate before יהוה,
on the Sabbaths and on the New Moons. 
Ezek
46:4  “And the burnt offering which the
prince brings to יהוה on the Sabbath day is six lambs,
perfect ones, and a ram, a perfect one. 
Ezek
46:5  “And the grain offering is one ĕphah
for a ram, and the grain offering for the lambs, a gift of his hand, and a hin
of oil for an ĕphah. 
Ezek
46:6  “And on the day of the New Moon: a
young bull, a perfect one, six lambs, and a ram, they should be perfect. 
Ezek
46:7  “And he prepares a grain offering
of an ĕphah for a bull, and an ĕphah for a ram, and for the lambs as
his hand attains, and a hin of oil for an ĕphah. 
Ezek
46:8  “And when the prince enters, he
comes in by way of the porch of that gate, and goes out the same way. 
Ezek
46:9  “And when the people of the land
enter before יהוה at the appointed times, whoever shall
enter by way of the north gate to bow himself, goes out by way of the south
gate. And whoever enters by way of the south gate, goes out by way of the north
gate, he shall not return by way of the gate through which he came, but goes
out through the opposite one. 
Ezek
46:10  “And the prince is to be in their
midst, entering when they enter, and going out when they go out. 
Ezek
46:11  “And in the festivals and in the
appointed times the grain offering is an ĕphah for a bull, and an ĕphah
for a ram, and for lambs the gift of his hand, and a hin of oil for an ĕphah.

Ezek
46:12  “And when the prince makes a
spontaneous burnt offering or spontaneous peace offerings to יהוה,
the gate facing east shall be opened for him. And he shall prepare his burnt
offering and his peace offerings as he did on the Sabbath day. And he shall go
out, and after he goes out the gate shall be shut. 
Ezek
46:13  “And make a daily burnt offering
to יהוה of a lamb a year old, a perfect one, preparing
it morning by morning. 
Ezek
46:14  “And prepare a grain offering with
it morning by morning, a sixth of an ĕphah, and a third of a hin of oil to
moisten the fine flour, a grain offering to יהוה –
continual everlasting laws. 
Ezek
46:15  “And prepare the lamb, and the
grain offering, and the oil, morning by morning, a continual burnt offering.” 
Ezek
46:16  ‘Thus said the Master יהוה,
“When the prince gives a gift of some of his inheritance to any of his sons, it
belongs to his sons, it is their possession by inheritance. 
Ezek
46:17  “And when he gives a gift of some
of his inheritance to one of his servants, then it shall be his till the year
of release, then it shall return to the prince. Only the inheritance of his
sons is theirs. 
Ezek
46:18  “And the prince does not take any
of the people’s inheritance by evicting them from their possession. He is to
give his sons their inheritance from his own possession, so that none of My
people are separated from his possession.” ’ ” 
Ezek
46:19  And he brought me through the
entrance, which was at the side of the gate, into the set-apart rooms of the
priests facing north. And look, there was a place at the extreme rear toward
the west. 
Ezek
46:20  And he said to me, “This is the
place where the priests cook the guilt offering and the sin offering, where
they bake the grain offering, so as not to bring them out into the outer
courtyard to set the people apart.” 
Ezek
46:21  And he brought me out into the
outer courtyard and made me pass along to the four corners of the courtyard.
And look, in every corner of the courtyard was another courtyard. 
Ezek
46:22  In the four corners of the
courtyard were courtyards covered over, forty cubits long and thirty wide,
these four corners having one measure, 
Ezek
46:23  and a row of building stones all
around in them, all around the four of them, and places for fire were made
under the rows, all around. 
Ezek
46:24  And he said to me, “These are the
kitchens where the attendants of the House cook the slaughterings of the
people.” 
Ezek
47:1  And he turned me back to the door
of the House. And look, water was flowing from under the threshold of the House
toward the east, for the House faced east, and the water was flowing from under
the right side of the House, from the south of the altar. 
Ezek
47:2  And he led me out by way of the
north gate, and took me round on the outside to the outer gate facing east. And
look, water trickling out on the right side. 
Ezek
47:3  As the man went out to the east
with the line in his hand, he measured one thousand cubits, and he made me pass
over into water, water to the ankles. 
Ezek
47:4  And he measured one thousand and
made me pass over into water, water to the knees. And he measured one thousand
and made me pass over, water to the loins. 
Ezek
47:5  And he measured one thousand, a
stream that I was unable to pass over, for the water had risen, water to swim,
a stream that is not passed over. 
Ezek
47:6  And he said to me, “Son of man,
have you seen this?” And he led me and brought me back to the bank of the
stream. 
Ezek
47:7  When I returned, then look, along
the bank of the stream were very many trees on one side and the other. 
Ezek
47:8  And he said to me, “These waters
are flowing toward the eastern country, and go down into the Araḇah, and
enter the sea, being made to flow into the sea, and the waters shall be healed.

Ezek
47:9  “And it shall be that every
swarming creature, wherever the stream goes, shall live. And there shall be
very many fish, for these waters shall go there, and they are healed. And
wherever the stream flows all shall live. 
Ezek
47:10  “And it shall be that fishermen
stand along it, from Ĕn Geḏi to Ĕn Eḡlayim, being places
for spreading their nets. Their fish is to be of the same kind as the fish of
the Great Sea, very many. 
Ezek
47:11  “Its swamps and marshes shall not
be healed, they shall be given over to salt. 
Ezek
47:12  “And by the bank of the stream, on
both sides, grow all kinds of trees used for food, whose leaves do not wither
and fruit do not fail. They bear fruit every month, because their water flows
from the set-apart place. And their fruit shall be for food, and their leaves
for healing.” 
Ezek
47:13  Thus said the Master יהוה,
“This is the border by which you inherit the land, according to the twelve
tribes of Yisra’ĕl, two portions for Yosĕph. 
Ezek
47:14  “And you shall inherit it, each
one the same as his brother. For I lifted My hand in an oath to give it to your
fathers, and this land shall fall to you as your inheritance. 
Ezek
47:15  “And this is the border of the
land on the north: from the Great Sea, the way of Ḥethlon, as one goes to
Tseḏaḏ, 
Ezek
47:16  “Ḥamath, Bĕrothah, Siḇrayim,
which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Ḥamath, Ḥatsar
Hattiḵon, which is on the border of Ḥawran. 
Ezek
47:17  “And the border shall be from the
Sea to Ḥatsar Ĕnan, the border of Damascus, and on the north toward
the north is the border of Ḥamath. This is the north side. 
Ezek
47:18  “And the east side is from between
Ḥawran, and Damascus, and Gil‛aḏ, and the land of Yisra’ĕl;
the Yardĕn, from the border to the eastern side of the sea you are to
measure. This is the east side. 
Ezek
47:19  “And the south side toward the
South is from Tamar to the waters of Meriḇah by Qaḏĕsh, along
the Wadi to the Great Sea. This is the south side toward the South. 
Ezek
47:20  “And the west side is the Great
Sea, from the border to the point opposite Ḥamath. This is the west side.

Ezek
47:21  “And you shall divide this land
among yourselves according to the tribes of Yisra’ĕl. 
Ezek
47:22  “And it shall be that you divide
it by lot as an inheritance for yourselves, and for the strangers who sojourn
in your midst and who bear children among you. And they shall be to you as
native-born among the children of Yisra’ĕl – with you they have an
inheritance in the midst of the tribes of Yisra’ĕl.
Ezek
47:23  “And it shall be that in whatever
tribe the stranger sojourns, there you give him his inheritance,” declares the
Master יהוה. 
Ezek
48:1  “And these are the names of the
tribes: From the north end along the way to Ḥethlon at the entrance of Ḥamath,
to Ḥatsar Ĕnan, the border of Damascus northward by the side of Ḥamath,
from its east to its west side, Dan: one. 
Ezek
48:2  “And by the border of Dan, from the
east side to the west, Ashĕr: one. 
Ezek
48:3  “And by the border of Ashĕr,
from the east side to the west, Naphtali: one. 
Ezek
48:4  “And by the border of Naphtali,
from the east side to the west, Menashsheh: one. 
Ezek
48:5  “And by the border of Menashsheh,
from the east side to the west, Ephrayim: one. 
Ezek
48:6  “And by the border of Ephrayim,
from the east side to the west, Re’uḇĕn: one. 
Ezek
48:7  “And by the border of Re’uḇĕn,
from the east side to the west, Yehuḏah: one. 
Ezek
48:8  “And by the border of Yehuḏah,
from the east side to the west, is the contribution which you offer up,
twenty-five thousand cubits in width,
and in length the same as one of the portions, from the east side to the west,
with the set-apart place in its midst. 
Ezek
48:9  “The contribution that you offer up
to יהוה is twenty-five thousand cubits in length and ten thousand in width. 
Ezek
48:10  “And of these is the set-apart
contribution for the priests: on the north twenty-five thousand cubits, and on the west ten thousand in
width, and on the east ten thousand in width, and on the south twenty-five
thousand in length. And the set-apart place of יהוה
shall be in its midst – 
Ezek
48:11  for the priests of the sons of Tsaḏoq,
who are set-apart, who did guard My Charge, who did not go astray when the
children of Yisra’ĕl went astray, as the Lĕwites went astray. 
Ezek
48:12  “So this contribution shall be to
them, from the contribution of the land, a most set-apart place by the border
of the Lĕwites. 
Ezek
48:13  “And alongside the border of the
priests, the Lĕwites have twenty-five thousand cubits in length and ten thousand in width, its entire length is
twenty-five thousand and its width ten thousand. 
Ezek
48:14  “And they do not sell any of it,
nor exchange it, nor transfer this best part of the land, for it is set-apart
to יהוה. 
Ezek
48:15  “And the five thousand cubits in width that is left, facing the
twenty-five thousand, is for common use by the city, for dwellings and open
land. And the city shall be in its midst. 
Ezek
48:16  “And these are its measurements:
the north side four thousand five hundred cubits,
and the south side four thousand five hundred, and the east side four thousand
five hundred, and the west side four thousand five hundred. 
Ezek
48:17  “And the open land of the city
shall be: to the north two hundred and fifty cubits, and to the south two hundred and fifty, and to the east two
hundred and fifty, and to the west two hundred and fifty. 
Ezek
48:18  “And the rest of the length,
alongside the contribution of the set-apart portion, is ten thousand cubits to the east and ten thousand to
the west. And it shall be alongside the contribution of the set-apart portion,
and its increase shall be food for the workers of the city. 
Ezek
48:19  “And the workers of the city, from
all the tribes of Yisra’ĕl, shall till it. 
Ezek
48:20  “The entire contribution is twenty-five
thousand cubits by twenty-five
thousand cubits, foursquare. You are to offer up the set-apart contribution
with the possession of the city. 
Ezek
48:21  “And the rest is for the prince,
on one side and on the other of the set-apart contribution and of the
possession of the city, facing the twenty-five thousand cubits of the set-apart contribution as far as the eastern border,
and westward facing the twenty-five thousand as far as the western border,
alongside the portions of the prince. And the set-apart contribution, and the
set-apart place of the House shall be in its midst. 
Ezek
48:22  “So the possession of the Lĕwites
and the possession of the city are in the midst of what belongs to the prince –
between the border of Yehuḏah and the border of Binyamin, it belongs to
the prince. 
Ezek
48:23  “As for the rest of the tribes,
from the east side to the west side, Binyamin: one. 
Ezek
48:24  “And by the border of Binyamin,
from the east side to the west side, Shim‛on: one. 
Ezek
48:25  “And by the border of Shim‛on,
from the east side to the west side, Yissasḵar: one. 
Ezek
48:26  “And by the border of Yissasḵar,
from the east side to the west side, Zeḇulun: one. 
Ezek
48:27  “And by the border of Zeḇulun,
from the east side to the west side, Gaḏ: one. 
Ezek
48:28  “And by the border of Gaḏ,
on the south side toward the South, the border shall be from Tamar to the
waters of Meriḇah by Qaḏĕsh, along the Wadi to the Great Sea. 
Ezek
48:29  “This is the land which you divide
by lot as an inheritance among the tribes of Yisra’ĕl, and these are their
portions,” declares the Master יהוה. 
Ezek
48:30  “And these are the exits of the
city, the gates of the city according to the names of the tribes of Yisra’ĕl:
On the north side, measuring four thousand five hundred cubits,
Ezek
48:31  the three gates northward: one
gate for Re’uḇĕn, one gate for Yehuḏah, one gate for Lĕwi.

Ezek
48:32  “And on the east side, four
thousand five hundred cubits, three
gates: one gate for Yosĕph, one gate for Binyamin, one gate for Dan. 
Ezek
48:33  “And on the south side, measuring
four thousand five hundred cubits,
three gates: one gate for Shim‛on, one gate for Yissasḵar, one gate
for Zeḇulun. 
Ezek
48:34  “And on the west side, four
thousand five hundred cubits with
their three gates: one gate for Gaḏ, one gate for Ashĕr, one gate
for Naphtali. 
Ezek
48:35  “All around: eighteen thousand
cubits. And the name of the city from that day is: יהוה
is there!”
