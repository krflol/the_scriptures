Jer
28:11  And Ḥananyah spoke in the
presence of all the people, saying, “Thus said יהוה, ‘So
I shall break the yoke of Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar sovereign of Baḇel
from the neck of all nations within two years.’ ” And the prophet Yirmeyah went
his way. 
Jer
28:12  And the word of יהוה
came to Yirmeyah, after Ḥananyah the prophet had broken the yoke from the
neck of the prophet Yirmeyah, saying, 
Jer
28:13  “Go and speak to Ḥananyah,
saying, ‘Thus said יהוה, “You have broken the yokes of
wood, but you shall make yokes of iron instead.” 
Jer
28:14  ‘For thus said יהוה
of hosts, the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, “I have put a yoke of iron on the neck
of all these nations, to serve Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar sovereign of
Baḇel. And they shall serve him. And I have also given him the beasts of
the field.” ’ ” 
Jer
28:15  And the prophet Yirmeyah said to Ḥananyah
the prophet, “Listen, please, Ḥananyah, יהוה has
not sent you, but you have made this people trust in falsehood. 
Jer
28:16  “Therefore thus said יהוה,
‘See, I am sending you away from the face of the earth. This year you shall
die, for you have spoken apostasy against יהוה.’ ” 
Jer
28:17  And Ḥananyah the prophet
died the same year, in the seventh month. 
Jer
29:1  And these are the words of the
letter which Yirmeyah the prophet sent from Yerushalayim to the rest of the
elders of the exile, and to the priests, and to the prophets and to all the
people whom Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar had exiled from Yerushalayim to
Baḇel – 
Jer
29:2  after Yeḵonyah the sovereign,
and the sovereigness mother, and the eunuchs, and the heads of Yehuḏah
and Yerushalayim, and the craftsmen, and the smiths had gone into exile from Yerushalayim – 
Jer
29:3  by the hand of El‛asah son of
Shaphan, and Gemaryah the son of Ḥilqiyah, whom Tsiḏqiyah sovereign
of Yehuḏah sent to Baḇel, to Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar the
sovereign of Baḇel, saying, 
Jer
29:4  “Thus said יהוה
of hosts, Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, to all the exiles whom I exiled from
Yerushalayim to Baḇel, 
Jer
29:5  ‘Build houses and dwell in them, plant gardens and eat their
fruit. 
Jer
29:6  ‘Take wives and bring forth sons
and daughters. And take wives for your sons and give your daughters to
husbands, and let them bear sons and daughters, and be increased there, and not
diminished. 
Jer
29:7  ‘And seek the peace of the city
where I have exiled you, and pray to יהוה for it, for
in its peace you have peace.’ 
Jer
29:8  “For thus said יהוה
of hosts, Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, ‘Let not your prophets and your diviners who
are in your midst deceive you, neither listen to the dreams which you are
dreaming. 
Jer
29:9  ‘For they are prophesying falsely
to you in My Name. I have not sent them,’ declares יהוה.

Jer
29:10  “For thus said יהוה,
‘When seventy years are completed, at Baḇel I shall visit you and
establish My good word toward you, to bring you back to this place. 
Jer
29:11  ‘For I know the plans I am planning
for you,’ declares יהוה, ‘plans of peace and not of
evil, to give you a future and an expectancy. 
Jer
29:12  ‘Then you shall call on Me, and
shall come and pray to Me, and I shall listen to you. 
Jer
29:13  ‘And you shall seek Me, and shall
find Me, when you search for Me with
all your heart.
Jer
29:14  ‘And I shall be found by you,’
declares יהוה, ‘and I shall turn back your captivity,
and shall gather you from all the gentiles and from all the places where I have
driven you, declares יהוה. And I shall bring you back
to the place from which I have exiled you.’ 
Jer
29:15  “Because you have said, ‘ יהוה
has raised up prophets for us in Baḇel’ – 
Jer
29:16  thus said יהוה
concerning the sovereign who sits on the throne of Dawiḏ, concerning all
the people who dwell in this city, and concerning your brothers who have not
gone out with you into exile, 
Jer
29:17  thus said יהוה
of hosts, ‘See, I am sending on them the sword, the scarcity of food, and the
pestilence. And I shall make them like spoilt figs, so spoilt as to be
uneatable. 
Jer
29:18  ‘And I shall pursue them with the
sword, with scarcity of food, and with pestilence. And I shall make them a
horror among all the reigns of the earth, to be a curse, and an astonishment,
and a hissing, and a reproach among all the gentiles where I have driven them. 
Jer
29:19  ‘For they did not heed My words,’
declares יהוה, ‘which I sent to them by My servants the
prophets, rising up early and sending them, yet you did not listen,’ declares יהוה.

Jer
29:20  “You, therefore, hear the word of יהוה,
all you exiles whom I have sent from Yerushalayim to Baḇel. 
Jer
29:21  “Thus said יהוה
of hosts, the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, concerning Aḥaḇ son of
Qolayah, and Tsiḏqiyahu son of Ma‛asĕyah, who are prophesying
falsely to you in My Name, ‘See, I am giving them into the hand of Neḇuḵaḏretstsar
sovereign of Baḇel, and he shall smite them before your eyes. 
Jer
29:22  ‘And because of them all the
exiles of Yehuḏah who are in Baḇel shall use a curse, saying, “ יהוה
make you like Tsiḏqiyahu and Aḥaḇ, whom the sovereign of Baḇel
roasted in the fire,” 
Jer
29:23  because they have done wickedness
in Yisra’ĕl, and committed adultery with their neighbours’ wives, and have
spoken a word in My Name falsely which I have not commanded them. And I am He
who knows, and a witness,’ declares יהוה. 
Jer
29:24  “And speak to Shemayahu the
Neḥelamite, saying, 
Jer
29:25  “Thus speaks יהוה
of hosts, the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, saying, ‘Because you have sent letters
in your name to all the people who are at Yerushalayim, to Tsephanyah son of Ma‛asĕyah
the priest, and to all the priests, saying, 
Jer
29:26  “ יהוה has
made you priest instead of Yehoyaḏa the priest, so that there are
overseers in the House of יהוה over everyone who is mad
and makes himself a prophet, that you should put him in the stocks and in the
iron collar. 
Jer
29:27  “So why have you not reproved
Yirmeyahu of Anathoth who makes himself a prophet to you? 
Jer
29:28  “For he has sent to us in Baḇel,
saying, ‘This captivity is long – build
houses and dwell in them, and plant
gardens and eat their fruit.’ ” ’ ”
Jer
29:29  And Tsephanyah the priest read
this letter in the hearing of Yirmeyahu the prophet. 
Jer
29:30  Then the word of יהוה
came to Yirmeyahu, saying, 
Jer
29:31  “Send to all those in exile,
saying, ‘Thus said יהוה concerning Shemayah the
Neḥelamite, “Because Shemayah has prophesied to you, and I have not sent
him, and he has made you to trust on falsehood,” 
Jer
29:32  therefore thus said יהוה,
“See, I am bringing punishment upon Shemayah the Neḥelamite and his seed:
he shall have no one to dwell among this people, nor is he to see the good that
I am about to do for My people,” declares יהוה, “because
he has spoken apostasy against יהוה.” ’ ” 
Jer
30:1  The word that came to Yirmeyahu
from יהוה, saying, 
Jer
30:2  “Thus spoke יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, saying, ‘Write in a book for yourself all the words
that I have spoken to you. 
Jer
30:3  ‘For look, the days are coming,’
declares יהוה, ‘when I shall turn back the captivity of
My people Yisra’ĕl and Yehuḏah,’ declares יהוה,
‘and I shall bring them back to the land that I gave to their fathers, and let
them possess it.’ ” 
Jer
30:4  And these are the words יהוה
spoke concerning Yisra’ĕl and Yehuḏah. 
Jer
30:5  “For this is what יהוה
said, ‘We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace. 
Jer
30:6  ‘Ask now, and see if a man is
giving birth. Why do I see every man with his hands on his loins like a woman
in labour, and all faces turned pale? 
Jer
30:7  ‘Oh! For great is that day, there
is none like it. And it is the time of Ya‛aqoḇ’s distress, but he
shall be saved out of it. 
Jer
30:8  ‘And it shall be in that day,’
declares יהוה of hosts, ‘that I break his yoke from
your neck, and tear off your bonds, and foreigners no more enslave them. 
Jer
30:9  ‘And they shall serve יהוה
their Elohim and Dawiḏ their sovereign, whom I raise up for them. 
Jer
30:10  ‘And you, do not fear, O Ya‛aqoḇ
My servant,’ declares יהוה, ‘nor be discouraged, O
Yisra’ĕl. For look, I am saving you from afar, and your seed from the land
of their captivity. And Ya‛aqoḇ shall return, and have rest and be
at ease, with no one to trouble him. 
Jer
30:11  ‘For I am with you,’ declares יהוה,
‘to save you. Though I make a complete end of all gentiles where I have
scattered you, yet I do not make a complete end of you. But I shall reprove you
in judgment, and by no means leave you unpunished.’
Jer
30:12  “For thus said יהוה,
‘Your breach is incurable, your wound is grievous. 
Jer
30:13  ‘No one pleads your cause, to bind
up. There are no healing medicines for you. 
Jer
30:14  ‘All those loving you have
forgotten you, they do not seek you. For I smote you as an enemy smites, with
cruel chastisement, because your crookedness is great, your sins have
increased. 
Jer
30:15  ‘Why do you cry about your breach?
Your pain is incurable. Because of your many crookednesses, because your sins
have increased, I have done this to you. 
Jer
30:16  ‘However, all those who devour you
shall be devoured. And all your adversaries, every one of them, shall go into
captivity. And those who exploit you shall be exploited, and all who prey upon
you I shall make a prey. 
Jer
30:17  ‘For I restore health to you and
heal you of your wounds,’ declares יהוה, ‘for they have
called you an outcast saying, “This is Tsiyon, no one is seeking her.” ’ 
Jer
30:18  “Thus said יהוה,
‘See, I turn back the captivity of Ya‛aqoḇ’s tents, and have
compassion on his dwelling places. And the city shall be built upon its own
mound, and the palace stand on its right place. 
Jer
30:19  ‘And out of them shall arise
thanksgiving and the voice of those who are laughing. And I shall increase
them, and they shall not diminish. And I shall esteem them, and they shall not
be small. 
Jer
30:20  ‘And his children shall be as
before, and his congregation shall be established before Me. And I shall punish
all who oppress them. 
Jer
30:21  ‘And his Prince shall be from him,
and his Ruler shall come from among him. And I shall bring him near, and he
shall approach Me, for who is this who pledged his heart to approach Me?’
declares יהוה. 
Jer
30:22  ‘And you shall be My people, and I
shall be your Elohim.’ ” 
Jer
30:23  See, the storm of יהוה
shall go forth in a rage, a whirling storm! It bursts upon the head of the
wrong. 
Jer
30:24  The burning displeasure of יהוה
shall not turn back until He has done and established the purposes of His
heart. In the latter days you shall understand it.
Jer
31:1  “At that time,” declares יהוה,
“I shall be the Elohim of all the clans of Yisra’ĕl, and they shall be My
people.” 
Jer
31:2  Thus said יהוה,
“A people escaped from the sword found favour in the wilderness, Yisra’ĕl,
when it went to find rest.” 
Jer
31:3  יהוה
appeared to me from afar, saying, “I
have loved you with an everlasting love, therefore I shall draw you with
kindness. 
Jer
31:4  “I am going to build you again. And
you shall be rebuilt, O maiden of Yisra’ĕl! Again you shall take up your
tambourines, and go forth in the dances of those who rejoice. 
Jer
31:5  “Again you shall plant vines on the
mountains of Shomeron. The planters shall plant and treat them as common. 
Jer
31:6  “For there shall be a day when the
watchmen cry on Mount Ephrayim, ‘Arise, and let us go up to Tsiyon, to יהוה
our Elohim.’ ” 
Jer
31:7  For thus said יהוה,
“Sing with gladness for Ya‛aqoḇ, and shout among the chief of the
nations. Cry out, give praise, and say, ‘O יהוה, save
Your people, the remnant of Yisra’ĕl!’ 
Jer
31:8  “See, I am bringing them from the
land of the north, and shall gather them from the ends of the earth, among them
the blind and the lame, those with child and those in labour, together – a
great assembly returning here. 
Jer
31:9  “With weeping they shall come, and
with their prayers I bring them. I
shall make them walk by rivers of waters, in a straight way in which they do
not stumble. For I shall be a Father to Yisra’ĕl, and Ephrayim – he is My
first-born. 
Jer
31:10  “Hear the word of יהוה,
O gentiles, and declare it in the isles afar off, and say, ‘He who scattered
Yisra’ĕl gathers him, and shall guard him as a shepherd his flock.’ 
Jer
31:11  “For יהוה
shall ransom Ya‛aqoḇ, and redeem him from the hand of one stronger
than he. 
Jer
31:12  “And they shall come in and shall
sing on the height of Tsiyon, and stream to the goodness of יהוה,
for grain and for new wine and for oil, and for the young of the flock and the
herd. And their being shall be like a well-watered garden, and never languish
again. 
Jer
31:13  “Then shall a maiden rejoice in a
dance, and young men and old, together. And I shall turn their mourning to joy,
and shall comfort them, and shall make them rejoice from their sorrow, 
Jer
31:14  and shall fill the being of the
priests with fatness. And My people shall be satisfied with My goodness,”
declares יהוה. 
Jer
31:15  Thus said יהוה,
“A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing, bitter weeping, Raḥĕl weeping
for her children, refusing to be comforted for her children, because they are
no more.” 
Jer
31:16  Thus said יהוה,
“Hold back your voice from weeping, and your eyes from tears, for there is a
reward for your work,” declares יהוה, “and they shall
return from the land of the enemy. 
Jer
31:17  “And there is expectancy for your
latter end,” declares יהוה, “and your children shall
return to their own country. 
Jer
31:18  “I have clearly heard Ephrayim
lamenting, ‘You have chastised me, and I was chastised, like an untrained calf.
Turn me back, and I shall turn back, for You are יהוה
my Elohim. 
Jer
31:19  ‘For after my turning back, I
repented. And after I was instructed, I struck myself on the thigh. I was
ashamed, even humiliated, for I bore the reproach of my youth.’ 
Jer
31:20  “Is Ephrayim a precious son to Me,
a child of delights? For though I spoke against him, I still remembered him.
That is why My affections were deeply moved for him. I have great compassion
for him,” declares יהוה. 
Jer
31:21  “Set up signposts, make landmarks;
set your heart toward the highway, the way in which you went. Turn back, O
maiden of Yisra’ĕl, turn back to these cities of yours! 
Jer
31:22  “Till when would you turn here and
there, O backsliding daughter? For יהוה has created
what is new on earth: a woman encompasses a man!” 
Jer
31:23  Thus said יהוה
of hosts, the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, “Let them once again say this word in the
land of Yehuḏah and in its cities, when I turn back their captivity, ‘ יהוה
bless you, O home of righteousness, mountain of set-apartness!’ 
Jer
31:24  “And in Yehuḏah and all its
cities farmers and those who journey with flocks, shall dwell together. 
Jer
31:25  “For I shall fill the weary being,
and I shall replenish every grieved being.” 
Jer
31:26  At this I awoke and looked around,
and my sleep was sweet to me. 
Jer
31:27  “See, the days are coming,”
declares יהוה, “that I shall sow the house of Yisra’ĕl
and the house of Yehuḏah with the seed of man and the seed of beast. 
Jer
31:28  “And it shall be, that as I have
watched over them to pluck up, and to break down, and to throw down, and to
destroy, and to afflict, so I shall watch over them to build and to plant,”
declares יהוה. 
Jer
31:29  “In those days they shall no
longer say, ‘The fathers ate sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are blunted.’

Jer
31:30  “But each one shall die for his
own crookedness – whoever eats sour grapes, his teeth shall be blunted. 
Jer
31:31  “See, the days are coming,”
declares יהוה, “when I shall make a new covenant with
the house of Yisra’ĕl and with the house of Yehuḏah,
Jer
31:32  not like the covenant I made with
their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the
land of Mitsrayim, My covenant which they broke, though I was a husband to
them,” declares יהוה. 
Jer
31:33  “For this is the covenant I shall
make with the house of Yisra’ĕl after those days, declares יהוה
: I shall put My Torah in their inward parts, and write it on their hearts. And
I shall be their Elohim, and they shall be My people. 
Jer
31:34  “And no longer shall they teach,
each one his neighbour, and each one his brother, saying, ‘Know יהוה,’
for they shall all know Me, from the least of them to the greatest of them,”
declares יהוה. “For I shall forgive their crookedness,
and remember their sin no more.” 
Jer
31:35  Thus said יהוה,
who gives the sun for a light by day, and the laws of the moon and the stars
for a light by night, who stirs up the sea, and its waves roar – יהוה
of hosts is His Name: 
Jer
31:36  “If these laws vanish from before
Me,” declares יהוה, “then the seed of Yisra’ĕl
shall also cease from being a nation before Me forever.” 
Jer
31:37  Thus said יהוה,
“If the heavens above could be measured, and the foundations of the earth
searched out beneath, I would also cast off all the seed of Yisra’ĕl for
all that they have done,” declares יהוה. 
Jer
31:38  “See, the days are coming,”
declares יהוה, “that the city shall be built for יהוה
from the Tower of Ḥanan’ĕl to the Corner Gate. 
Jer
31:39  “And the measuring line shall
again extend straight ahead to the hill Garĕḇ, then it shall turn
toward Go‛ah. 
Jer
31:40  “And all the valley of the dead
bodies and of the ashes, and all the fields as far as the wadi Qiḏron, to
the corner of the Horse Gate toward the east, is to be set-apart to יהוה.
It shall not be plucked up or thrown down any more forever.” 
Jer
32:1  The word that came to Yirmeyahu
from יהוה in the tenth year of Tsiḏqiyahu
sovereign of Yehuḏah, which was the eighteenth year of Neḇuḵaḏretstsar.

Jer
32:2  Now at that time the army of the
sovereign of Baḇel besieged Yerushalayim, and Yirmeyahu the prophet was
shut up in the court of the guard, which was in the house of the sovereign of
Yehuḏah. 
Jer
32:3  For Tsiḏqiyahu sovereign of
Yehuḏah had shut him up, saying, “Why are you prophesying, saying, ‘Thus
said יהוה, “See, I am giving this city into the hand of
the sovereign of Baḇel, and he shall take it, 
Jer
32:4  and Tsiḏqiyahu sovereign of
Yehuḏah shall not escape from the hand of the Chaldeans, but certainly be
given into the hand of the sovereign of Baḇel, and shall speak with him
face to face, and see him eye to eye, 
Jer
32:5  and he shall lead Tsiḏqiyahu
to Baḇel, and be there until I visit him,” declares יהוה,
“though you fight with the Chaldeans, you shall not prosper” ’?” 
Jer
32:6  And Yirmeyahu said, “The word of יהוה
came to me, saying, 
Jer
32:7  ‘See, Ḥaname’ĕl son of
Shallum your uncle is coming to you, saying, “Buy my field which is in
Anathoth, for the right of redemption is yours to buy it.” ’ 
Jer
32:8  “So Ḥaname’ĕl my uncle’s
son came to me in the court of the guard according to the word of יהוה,
and said to me, ‘Please buy my field that is in Anathoth, which is in the land
of Binyamin, for the right of inheritance is yours, and the redemption. Buy it
for yourself.’ And I knew that this was the word of יהוה.

Jer
32:9  “And I bought the field which was
at Anathoth from Ḥaname’ĕl, my uncle’s son, and weighed out to him
the silver, seventeen sheqels of silver. 
Jer
32:10  “And I signed the deed and sealed
it, took witnesses, and weighed the silver in the scales. 
Jer
32:11  “Then I took the deed of purchase –
that which was sealed according to the command and law, and that which was open
– 
Jer
32:12  and I gave the deed of purchase to
Baruḵ son of Nĕriyah, son of Maḥsĕyah, in the presence of
Ḥaname’ĕl my uncle’s son, and in the presence of the witnesses who
signed the deed of purchase, before all the Yehuḏim who sat in the court
of the guard. 
Jer
32:13  “And I commanded Baruḵ
before their eyes, saying, 
Jer
32:14  ‘Thus said יהוה
of hosts, the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, “Take these deeds, both this deed of
purchase which is sealed and this deed which is open, and put them in an
earthen vessel, so that they remain many days.” 
Jer
32:15  ‘For thus said יהוה
of hosts, the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, “Houses and fields and vineyards shall
again be bought in this land.” ’ 
Jer
32:16  “And after I had given the deed of
purchase to Baruḵ son of Nĕriyah, I prayed to יהוה,
saying, 
Jer
32:17  ‘Ah, Master יהוה
! See, You have made the heavens and the earth by Your great power and
outstretched arm. There is no matter too hard for You, 
Jer
32:18  who show kindness to thousands,
and repay the crookedness of the fathers into the bosom of their children after
them – the Great, the Mighty Ĕl, יהוה of hosts is
His Name, 
Jer
32:19  great in counsel and mighty in
work, for Your eyes are open to all the ways of the sons of men, to give
everyone according to his ways and according to the fruit of his deeds.
Jer
32:20  ‘For You have set signs and
wonders in the land of Mitsrayim, to this day, and in Yisra’ĕl and among
other men. And You have made Yourself a Name, as it is this day. 
Jer
32:21  ‘And You have brought Your people
Yisra’ĕl out of the land of Mitsrayim with signs and wonders, with a
strong hand and an outstretched arm, and with great fearsome deeds. 
Jer
32:22  ‘And You gave them this land, of
which You swore to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and
honey. 
Jer
32:23  ‘And they came in and possessed
it, but they did not obey Your voice nor did they walk in Your Torah. They did
not do all that You commanded them to do, so You brought all this evil upon
them. 
Jer
32:24  ‘See the siege mounds! They have
come to the city to take it. And the city has been given into the hand of the
Chaldeans who fight against it, because of the sword and the scarcity of food
and the pestilence. And what You have spoken has come about, and look, You see
it! 
Jer
32:25  ‘Yet You, O Master יהוה,
have said to me, “Buy the field for silver, and take witnesses”! although the
city has been given into the hand of the Chaldeans.’ ” 
Jer
32:26  Then the word of יהוה
came to Yirmeyahu, saying, 
Jer
32:27  “See, I am יהוה,
the Elohim of all flesh. Is there any matter too hard for Me?” 
Jer
32:28  Therefore thus said יהוה,
“See, I am giving this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, into the hand of Neḇuḵaḏretstsar
sovereign of Baḇel, and he shall take it. 
Jer
32:29  “And the Chaldeans who fight
against this city shall come and set fire to this city and burn it, with the
houses on whose roofs they burned incense to Ba‛al and poured out drink
offerings to other mighty ones, to provoke Me. 
Jer
32:30  “For the children of Yisra’ĕl
and the children of Yehuḏah have done only evil before Me, from their
youth. For the children of Yisra’ĕl have only provoked Me with the work of
their hands,” declares יהוה. 
Jer
32:31  “For this city has been a cause
for My displeasure and My wrath from the day that they built it, even to this
day that I should remove it from before My face, 
Jer
32:32  because of all the evil of the
children of Yisra’ĕl and the children of Yehuḏah, which they have
done to provoke Me – they, their sovereigns, their heads, their priests, their
prophets, and the men of Yehuḏah, and the inhabitants of Yerushalayim. 
Jer
32:33  “And they have turned their back
to Me, and not their face – though I taught them, rising up early and teaching
them, they did not listen to receive instruction. 
Jer
32:34  “And they set their abominations
in the house which is called by My Name, to defile it. 
Jer
32:35  “And they built the high places of
Ba‛al which are in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, to offer up their
sons and their daughters to Moleḵ, which I did not command them, nor did
it come into My heart, that they should do this abomination, to make Yehuḏah
sin. 
Jer
32:36  “And now, thus said יהוה,
the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, concerning this city of which you say, ‘It shall
be given into the hand of the sovereign of Baḇel by the sword, and by
scarcity of food, and by pestilence’: 
Jer
32:37  ‘See, I am gathering them out of
all the lands where I have driven them in My displeasure, and in My wrath, and
in great rage. And I shall bring them back to this place, and shall let them
dwell in safety. 
Jer
32:38  ‘And they shall be My people, and
I shall be their Elohim. 
Jer
32:39  ‘And I shall give them one heart
and one way, to fear Me all the days, for the good of them and of their
children after them. 
Jer
32:40  ‘And I shall make an everlasting
covenant with them, that I do not turn back from doing good to them. And I
shall put My fear in their hearts so as not to turn aside from Me. 
Jer
32:41  ‘And I shall rejoice over them to
do good to them, and shall plant them in this land in truth, with all My heart
and with all My being.’ 
Jer
32:42  “For thus said יהוה,
‘As I have brought all this great evil on this people, so I am bringing on them
all the good that I am speaking to them. 
Jer
32:43  ‘And fields shall be bought in
this land of which you are saying, “It is a wasteland, without man or beast. It
has been given into the hand of the Chaldeans.” 
Jer
32:44  ‘Fields shall be bought for
silver, and deeds signed and sealed, and witnesses be called, in the land of
Binyamin, and in the places around Yerushalayim, and in the cities of Yehuḏah,
and in the cities of the mountains, and in the cities of the low country, and
in the cities of the South. For I shall turn back their captivity,’ declares יהוה.”

Jer
33:1  And the word of יהוה
came to Yirmeyahu a second time, while he was still shut up in the court of the
guard, saying, 
Jer
33:2  “Thus said יהוה
who made it, יהוה who formed it to establish it, יהוה
is His Name, 
Jer
33:3  ‘Call unto Me, and I shall answer
you, and show you great and inaccessible matters,
which you have not known.’ 
Jer
33:4  “For thus said יהוה,
the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, concerning the houses of this city and the houses
of the sovereigns of Yehuḏah, which are thrown down against the siege
mounds and the sword, 
Jer
33:5  while coming to fight with the
Chaldeans, and to fill their places with the corpses of men whom I shall slay
in My displeasure and My wrath, all for whose evil I have hidden My face from
this city. 
Jer
33:6  ‘See, I am bringing to it relief
and healing. And I shall heal them and reveal to them the riches of peace and
truth. 
Jer
33:7  ‘And I shall turn back the
captivity of Yehuḏah and the captivity of Yisra’ĕl, and shall build
them as at the first, 
Jer
33:8  and shall cleanse them from all
their crookedness that they have sinned against Me. And I shall pardon all
their crookednesses that they have sinned and by which they have transgressed
against Me. 
Jer
33:9  ‘And it shall be to Me a name of
joy, a praise, and a pride before all nations of the earth, who hear all the
good I am doing to them, and they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness
and all the peace I am doing to it.’ 
Jer
33:10  “Thus said יהוה,
‘In this place of which you say, “It is dried up, without man and without
beast,” in the cities of Yehuḏah, in the streets of Yerushalayim that are
deserted, without man and without inhabitant and without beast, there shall
once again be heard
Jer
33:11  the voice of joy and the voice of
gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of
those who are saying, “Praise יהוה of hosts, for יהוה
is good, for His kindness is forever,” of those who are bringing the offering
of praise into the House of יהוה. For I shall turn back
the captivity of the land, as at the first,’ declares יהוה.

Jer
33:12  “Thus said יהוה
of hosts, ‘In this place which is dried up, without man and without beast, and
in all its cities, there shall once again be a home of shepherds causing their
flocks to lie down. 
Jer
33:13  ‘In the cities of the mountains,
in the cities of the low country, and in the cities of the South, and in the
land of Binyamin, and in the places around Yerushalayim, and in the cities of
Yehuḏah, the flocks once again pass under the hands of him who counts
them,’ declares יהוה. 
Jer
33:14  ‘See, the days are coming,’
declares יהוה, ‘when I shall establish the good word
which I have promised to the house of Yisra’ĕl and to the house of Yehuḏah:

Jer
33:15  ‘In those days and at that time I
cause a Branch of righteousness to spring forth for Dawiḏ. And He shall
do right-ruling and righteousness in the earth. 
Jer
33:16  ‘In those days Yehuḏah shall
be saved, and Yerushalayim dwell in safety. And this is that which shall be
proclaimed to her: ‘ יהוה our Righteousness.’ 
Jer
33:17  “For thus said יהוה,
‘For Dawiḏ there is not to cease a man to sit on the throne of the house
of Yisra’ĕl. 
Jer
33:18  ‘And for the priests, the Lĕwites,
there is not to cease a man to offer burnt offerings before Me, to kindle grain
offerings, and to slaughter continually.’ ” 
Jer
33:19  And the word of יהוה
came to Yirmeyahu, saying, 
Jer
33:20  “Thus said יהוה,
‘If you could break My covenant with the day and My covenant with the night, so
that there be not day and night in their season, 
Jer
33:21  then My covenant could also be
broken with Dawiḏ My servant – so that he shall not have a son to reign
upon his throne – and with the Lĕwites, the priests, My attendants. 
Jer
33:22  ‘As the host of the heavens is not
counted, nor the sand of the sea measured, so I increase the descendants of
Dawiḏ My servant and the Lĕwites who attend upon Me.’ ” 
Jer
33:23  And the word of יהוה
came to Yirmeyahu, saying, 
Jer
33:24  “Have you not observed what these
people have spoken, saying, ‘The two clans which יהוה
has chosen have been rejected by Him’? So they have despised My people, no more
to be a nation before them.
Jer
33:25  “Thus said יהוה,
‘If My covenant is not with day and night, and if I have not appointed the laws
of the heavens and earth, 
Jer
33:26  then I would also reject the
descendants of Ya‛aqoḇ and Dawiḏ My servant, so that I should
not take of his descendants to be rulers over the descendants of Aḇraham,
Yitsḥaq, and Ya‛aqoḇ. For I shall turn back their captivity,
and have compassion on them.’ ” 
Jer
34:1  The word which came to Yirmeyahu
from יהוה, when Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar
sovereign of Baḇel and all his army, and all the reigns of the earth
under his rule, and all the people, fought against Yerushalayim and all its
cities, saying, 
Jer
34:2  “Thus said יהוה
the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, ‘Go and speak to Tsiḏqiyahu sovereign of
Yehuḏah and say to him, “Thus said יהוה, ‘See, I
am giving this city into the hand of the sovereign of Baḇel. And he shall
burn it with fire, 
Jer
34:3  and you shall not escape out of his
hand, but certainly be taken and given into his hand. And your eyes shall see
the eyes of the sovereign of Baḇel, and his mouth shall speak with your
mouth, and you shall go to Baḇel.’ ” ’ 
Jer
34:4  “But hear the word of יהוה,
O Tsiḏqiyahu sovereign of Yehuḏah! Thus said יהוה
concerning you, ‘You shall not die by the sword. 
Jer
34:5  ‘In peace you are to die, and as in
the burnings of spices for your fathers, the former sovereigns who were before
you, so they shall burn spices for you and lament for you, saying, “Alas,
master!” ’ For I have spoken the word,” declares יהוה. 
Jer
34:6  And Yirmeyahu the prophet spoke all
these words to Tsiḏqiyahu the sovereign of Yehuḏah in Yerushalayim,

Jer
34:7  while the sovereign of Baḇel’s
army was fighting against Yerushalayim and all the cities of Yehuḏah that
were left, against Laḵish and Azĕqah. For only these walled cities
remained of the cities of Yehuḏah. 
Jer
34:8  The word which came to Yirmeyahu
from יהוה, after Sovereign Tsiḏqiyahu had made a
covenant with all the people who were at Yerushalayim to proclaim release to
them: 
Jer
34:9  that everyone was to set free his
male and female slave, the Heḇrew man and the Heḇrew woman, no one
was to keep a Yehuḏite, his brother, enslaved. 
Jer
34:10  And when all the heads and all the
people who had come into the covenant heard that each one was to set free his
male and female slaves, and not keep them enslaved any longer, they obeyed and
released them. 
Jer
34:11  But afterward they changed their
minds and made the male and female slaves return, whom they had set free, and
brought them into subjection as male and female slaves. 
Jer
34:12  Therefore the word of יהוה
came to Yirmeyahu from יהוה, saying, 
Jer
34:13  “Thus said יהוה
the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, ‘I Myself made a covenant with your fathers in the
day that I brought them out of the land of Mitsrayim, out of the house of
bondage, saying, 
Jer
34:14  “At the end of seven years each
one should set free his Heḇrew brother, who has been sold to him. And
when he has served you six years, you shall let him go free from you.” But your
fathers did not obey Me nor incline their ear. 
Jer
34:15  ‘And you recently turned and did
what was right in My eyes, each man proclaiming release to his neighbour. And
you made a covenant before Me in the house which is called by My Name. 
Jer
34:16  ‘But you turned back and profaned
My Name, and each one of you took back his male and female slaves, whom he had
set free, at their pleasure, and brought them into subjection, to be your male
and female slaves.’ 
Jer
34:17  “Therefore thus said יהוה,
‘You have not obeyed Me in proclaiming release, each one to his brother and
each one to his neighbour. See, I am proclaiming release to you,’ declares יהוה,
‘to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the scarcity of food! And I shall make
you a horror to all reigns of the earth. 
Jer
34:18  ‘And I shall give the men who are
transgressing My covenant, who have not established the words of the covenant
which they made before Me, when they cut the calf in two and passed between the
parts of it: 
Jer
34:19  the heads of Yehuḏah, and
the heads of Yerushalayim, the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of
the land who passed between the parts of the calf. 
Jer
34:20  ‘And I shall give them into the
hand of their enemies and into the hand of those who seek their life. And their
corpses shall be for food to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the
earth. 
Jer
34:21  ‘And I shall give Tsiḏqiyahu
sovereign of Yehuḏah and his heads into the hand of their enemies, and
into the hand of those who seek their life, and into the hand of the sovereign
of Baḇel’s army that has withdrawn from you. 
Jer
34:22  ‘See, I am commanding,’ declares יהוה,
‘and shall bring them back to this city, and they shall fight against it and
take it and burn it with fire. And I shall make the cities of Yehuḏah a
ruin without inhabitant.’ ” 
Jer
35:1  The word which came to Yirmeyahu
from יהוה in the days of Yehoyaqim son of Yoshiyahu,
sovereign of Yehuḏah, saying, 
Jer
35:2  “Go to the house of the Rĕḵaḇites.
And you shall speak to them, and bring them into the House of יהוה,
into one of the rooms, and give them wine to drink.” 
Jer
35:3  And I took Ya‛azanyah the son
of Yirmeyahu, the son of Ḥaḇatstsinyah, and his brothers and all
his sons, and all the house of the Rĕḵaḇites, 
Jer
35:4  and brought them into the House of יהוה,
into the room of the sons of Ḥanan son of Yiḡdalyahu, a man of
Elohim, which was by the chamber of the heads, above the room of Ma‛asĕyahu
son of Shallum, the keeper of the door. 
Jer
35:5  And I set before the sons of the
house of the Rĕḵaḇites bowls filled with wine, and cups, and I
said to them, “Drink wine.” 
Jer
35:6  But they said, “We do not drink
wine, because Yonaḏaḇ the son of Rĕḵaḇ, our
father, commanded us, saying, ‘You shall not drink wine, neither you nor your
sons, forever. 
Jer
35:7  ‘And do not build a house, neither
sow seed, nor plant a vineyard, nor have any of these, but dwell in tents all
your days, so that you live many days on the face of the land where you are
sojourners.’ 
Jer
35:8  “So we obeyed the voice of Yonaḏaḇ
son of Rĕḵaḇ, our father, in all that he commanded us, to
drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, and our daughters, 
Jer
35:9  nor to build ourselves houses to
dwell in. And we have no vineyard, field or seed. 
Jer
35:10  “But we dwell in tents, and have
obeyed and done according to all that Yonaḏaḇ our father commanded
us. 
Jer
35:11  “And it came to be, whenNeḇuḵaḏretst-sar
sovereign of Baḇel came up into the land, that we said, ‘Come, let us go
to Yerushalayim for fear of the army of the Chaldeans and for fear of the army
of the Arameans.’ So we dwell at Yerushalayim.” 
Jer
35:12  And the word of יהוה
came to Yirmeyahu, saying, 
Jer
35:13  “Thus said יהוה
of hosts, the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, ‘Go, and you shall say to the men of
Yehuḏah and to the inhabitants of Yerushalayim, “Have you not received
instruction, to obey My words?” declares יהוה. 
Jer
35:14  “The words of Yonaḏaḇ
son of Rĕḵaḇ, which he commanded his sons, not to drink wine,
are established, and they have not drunk unto this day, for they have obeyed their
father’s command. And as for Me, I have spoken to you, rising early and
speaking, but you have not obeyed Me. 
Jer
35:15  “And I sent to you all My servants
the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, ‘Turn, each one from
his evil way, and make good your deeds, and do not go after other mighty ones
to serve them, and you shall dwell in the land which I have given you and your
fathers.’ But you have not inclined your ear, nor obeyed Me. 
Jer
35:16  “The sons of Yonaḏaḇ
son of Rĕḵaḇ have indeed carried out the command of their
father which he commanded them, but this people has not obeyed Me.” ’ 
Jer
35:17  “Therefore thus said יהוה
Elohim of hosts, the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, ‘See, I am bringing on Yehuḏah
and on all the inhabitants of Yerushalayim all the evil I have pronounced
against them, because I have spoken to them but they did not listen, and I have
called to them but they did not answer.’ ” 
Jer
35:18  And Yirmeyahu said to the house of
the Rĕḵaḇites, “Thus said יהוה of
hosts, the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, ‘Because you have obeyed the command of
Yonaḏaḇ your father, and guarded all his commands and done
according to all that he commanded you, 
Jer
35:19  therefore thus said יהוה
of hosts, the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, “Of Yonaḏaḇ son of Rĕḵaḇ
there shall never cease to be a man to stand before Me.” ’ ” 
Jer
36:1  And it came to be in the fourth
year of Yehoyaqim son of Yoshiyahu, sovereign of Yehuḏah, that this word
came to Yirmeyahu from יהוה, saying, 
Jer
36:2  “Take a scroll and write on it all
the words that I have spoken to you against Yisra’ĕl, and against Yehuḏah,
and against all the nations, from the day I spoke to you, from the days of
Yoshiyahu even to this day. 
Jer
36:3  “It could be that the house of Yehuḏah
hears of all the evil which I plan to bring upon them, so that each one turns
back from his evil way, and I shall pardon their crookedness and their sin.” 
Jer
36:4  And Yirmeyahu called Baruḵ
son of Nĕriyah. And Baruḵ wrote on a scroll from the mouth of
Yirmeyahu, all the words of יהוה which He had spoken to
him. 
Jer
36:5  And Yirmeyahu commanded Baruḵ,
saying, “I am shut up, I am unable to enter the House of יהוה.

Jer
36:6  “But you shall enter, and shall
read from the scroll which you have written from my mouth, the words of יהוה,
in the hearing of the people in the House of יהוה on
the day of fasting. And also read them in the hearing of all Yehuḏah who
come from their cities. 
Jer
36:7  “It could be that they present
their supplication before יהוה, and they turn back,
each one from his evil way. For great is the displeasure and the wrath that יהוה
has spoken against this people.” 
Jer
36:8  And Baruḵ son of Nĕriyah
did according to all that Yirmeyahu the prophet commanded him, reading from the
book the words of יהוה in the House of יהוה.

Jer
36:9  And it came to be in the fifth year
of Yehoyaqim son of Yoshiyahu, sovereign of Yehuḏah, in the ninth month,
that they called a fast before יהוה to all the people
in Yerushalayim, and to all the people who came from the cities of Yehuḏah
to Yerushalayim. 
Jer
36:10  And Baruḵ read from the book
the words of Yirmeyahu in the House of יהוה, in the
room of Gemaryahu son of Shaphan the scribe, in the upper courtyard at the
entry of the New Gate of the House of יהוה, in the
hearing of all the people. 
Jer
36:11  And Miḵayehu son of
Gemaryahu, son of Shaphan, heard all the words of יהוה
from the book, 
Jer
36:12  And then he went down to the
sovereign’s house, into the scribe’s room. And there all the heads were
sitting: Elishama the scribe, and Delayahu son of Shemayahu, and Elnathan son
of Aḵbor, and Gemaryahu son of Shaphan, and Tsiḏqiyahu son of Ḥananyahu,
and all the heads. 
Jer
36:13  And Miḵayehu told them all
the words which he heard when Baruḵ read the book in the hearing of the
people. 
Jer
36:14  Then all the heads sent Yehuḏi
son of Nethanyahu, son of Shelemyahu, son of Kushi, to Baruḵ, saying, “Take
in your hand the scroll from which you have read in the hearing of the people,
and come.” So Baruḵ son of Nĕriyahu took the scroll in his hand and
came to them. 
Jer
36:15  And they said to him, “Sit down,
please, and read it in our hearing.” Then Baruḵ read it in their hearing.

Jer
36:16  And it came to be, when they had
heard all the words, that they looked at each other in fear, and said to Baruḵ,
“We are certainly going to report all these words to the sovereign.” 
Jer
36:17  And they asked Baruḵ,
saying, “Please explain to us, how did you write all these words? From his
mouth?” 
Jer
36:18  And Baruḵ answered them, “From
his mouth he spoke all these words to me, and I wrote them with ink in the
book.” 
Jer
36:19  Then the heads said to Baruḵ,
“Go, hide, you and Yirmeyahu, and let no one know where you are.” 
Jer
36:20  And they went to the sovereign,
into the court. But they put the scroll in the room of Elishama the scribe, and
told all the words in the hearing of the sovereign. 
Jer
36:21  The sovereign therefore sent Yehuḏi
to bring the scroll, and he took it from the room of Elishama the scribe. And
Yehuḏi read it in the hearing of the sovereign and in the hearing of all
the heads standing beside the sovereign. 
Jer
36:22  And the sovereign was sitting in
the winter house in the ninth month, with a fire burning on the hearth before
him. 
Jer
36:23  Then it came to be, when Yehuḏi
had read three or four columns, that the sovereign cut it with the scribe’s
knife and threw it into the fire that was on the hearth, until the entire
scroll was burned in the fire that was on the hearth. 
Jer
36:24  Yet the sovereign and all his
servants who heard all these words were not afraid, nor did they tear their
garments. 
Jer
36:25  Moreover, Elnathan, and Delayahu,
and Gemaryahu pleaded with the sovereign not to burn the scroll, but he did not
listen to them. 
Jer
36:26  And the sovereign commanded Yeraḥme’ĕl
son of the sovereign, and Serayahu son of Azri’ĕl, and Shelemyahu son of Aḇde’ĕl,
to seize Baruḵ the scribe and Yirmeyahu the prophet, but יהוה
had hid them. 
Jer
36:27  And after the sovereign had burned
the scroll with the words which Baruḵ had written from the mouth of
Yirmeyahu, the word of יהוה came to Yirmeyahu, saying, 
Jer
36:28  “Take another scroll, and write on
it all the former words that were in the first scroll which Yehoyaqim the
sovereign of Yehuḏah has burned, 
Jer
36:29  and say to Yehoyaqim sovereign of
Yehuḏah, ‘Thus said יהוה, “You have burned this
scroll, saying, ‘Why have you written in it that the sovereign of Baḇel
is certainly coming to destroy this land, and cause man and beast to cease from
here?’ ” 
Jer
36:30  ‘Therefore thus said יהוה
concerning Yehoyaqim sovereign of Yehuḏah, “He shall have no one to sit
on the throne of Dawiḏ, and his dead body is to be thrown out, to the
heat of the day and the frost of the night. 
Jer
36:31  “And I shall punish him, and his
seed, and his servants for their crookedness. And I shall bring on them, and on
the inhabitants of Yerushalayim, and on the men of Yehuḏah all the evil I
have spoken against them. But they did not listen.” ’ ” 
Jer
36:32  So Yirmeyahu took another scroll
and gave it to Baruḵ the scribe, son of Nĕriyahu, who wrote on it
from the mouth of Yirmeyahu all the words of the book which Yehoyaqim sovereign
of Yehuḏah had burned in the fire. And many similar words were added to
them. 
Jer
37:1  And Sovereign Tsiḏqiyahu son of
Yoshiyahu reigned instead of Konyahu son of Yehoyaqim, whom Neḇuḵaḏretstsar
sovereign of Baḇel set up to reign in the land of Yehuḏah. 
Jer
37:2  But neither he nor his servants nor
the people of the land had listened to the words of יהוה
which He spoke by the prophet Yirmeyahu. 
Jer
37:3  And Tsiḏqiyahu the sovereign
sent Yehuḵal son of Shelemyah, and the priest, Tsephanyahu son of Ma‛asĕyah,
to the prophet Yirmeyahu, saying, “Please pray to יהוה
our Elohim for us.” 
Jer
37:4  Now Yirmeyahu was still coming and
going among the people, for they had not yet put him in prison. 
Jer
37:5  Meanwhile, Pharaoh’s army had set
out from Mitsrayim. And when the Chaldeans who were besieging Yerushalayim
heard news of them, they withdrew from Yerushalayim. 
Jer
37:6  And the word of יהוה
came to Yirmeyahu the prophet, saying, 
Jer
37:7  “Thus said יהוה
the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, ‘Say this to the sovereign of Yehuḏah, who
sent you to Me to inquire of Me, “See, Pharaoh’s army which has come up to help
you, shall turn back to Mitsrayim, to their own land. 
Jer
37:8  “And the Chaldeans shall return and
fight against this city, and take it and burn it with fire.” ’ 
Jer
37:9  “Thus said יהוה,
‘Do not deceive yourselves, saying, “The Chaldeans shall go away from us,” for
they do not go. 
Jer
37:10  ‘For though you had smitten the
entire army of the Chaldeans who are fighting against you, and there remained
only wounded men among them, they would get up, each man in his tent, and burn
the city with fire.’ ” 
Jer
37:11  And it came to be, when the army
of the Chaldeans left the siege of Yerushalayim for fear of Pharaoh’s army, 
Jer
37:12  that Yirmeyahu went out of
Yerushalayim to go into the land of Binyamin to receive his portion there in
the midst of the people. 
Jer
37:13  And it came to be, as he was in
the gate of Binyamin, a master of the guard was there whose name was Yiriyah
son of Shelemyah, son of Ḥananyah. And he seized Yirmeyahu the prophet,
saying, “You are deserting to the Chaldeans!” 
Jer
37:14  But Yirmeyahu said, “It is a lie!
I am not deserting to the Chaldeans.” But he did not listen to him, and Yiriyah
seized Yirmeyahu and brought him to the heads. 
Jer
37:15  And the heads were wroth with
Yirmeyahu, and smote him and put him in prison in the house of Yehonathan the
scribe. For they had made that for a prison. 
Jer
37:16  When Yirmeyahu had entered into
the dungeon and into the cells, then Yirmeyahu remained there many days. 
Jer
37:17  And Tsiḏqiyahu the sovereign
sent and took him out. And the sovereign asked him secretly in his house, and
said, “Is there any word from יהוה ?” And Yirmeyahu
said, “There is.” And he said, “You are given into the hand of the sovereign of
Baḇel!” 
Jer
37:18  And Yirmeyahu said to Tsiḏqiyahu
the sovereign, “What have I sinned against you, and against your servants, and
against this people, that you have put me into prison? 
Jer
37:19  “Where are your prophets who
prophesied to you, saying, ‘The sovereign of Baḇel is not coming against
you or against this land?’ 
Jer
37:20  “But now, please hear, O my master
the sovereign. Please, let my petition be accepted before you, and do not make
me return to the house of Yehonathan the scribe, lest I die there.” 
Jer
37:21  Tsiḏqiyahu the sovereign
then gave orders for Yirmeyahu to be placed in the court of the guard, and that
they should give him daily a piece of bread from the bakers’ street, until all
the bread in the city was gone. So Yirmeyahu remained in the court of the
guard. 
Jer
38:1  And Shephatyah son of Mattan, and
Geḏalyahu son of Pashhur, and Yuḵal son of Shelemyahu, and Pashhur
son of Malkiyah heard the words which Yirmeyahu had spoken to all the people,
saying, 
Jer
38:2  “Thus said יהוה,
‘He who remains in this city shall die by the sword, by scarcity of food, and
by pestilence, but whoever goes over to the Chaldeans shall live. And his life
shall be as a prize to him, and he shall live.’ 
Jer
38:3  “Thus said יהוה,
‘This city is certainly given into the hand of the sovereign of Baḇel’s
army, and he shall take it.’ ” 
Jer
38:4  Then the heads said to the
sovereign, “Please, let this man be put to death, because he is weakening the
hands of the men of battle who are left in this city, and the hands of all the
people, by speaking such words to them. For this man does not seek the peace of
this people, but the evil.” 
Jer
38:5  And Tsiḏqiyahu the sovereign
said, “Look, he is in your hand. For the sovereign is unable to do any matter
against you.” 
Jer
38:6  And they took Yirmeyahu and threw
him into the dungeon of Malkiyahu the sovereign’s son, which was in the court
of the guard, and they let Yirmeyahu down with ropes. And in the dungeon there
was no water, but mud. So Yirmeyahu sank in the mud. 
Jer
38:7  And Eḇeḏ-Meleḵ
the Kushite, one of the eunuchs, who was in the sovereign’s house, heard that
they had put Yirmeyahu in the dungeon. And the sovereign was sitting at the
Gate of Binyamin, 
Jer
38:8  And Eḇeḏ-Meleḵ
came from the sovereign’s house and spoke to the sovereign, saying, 
Jer
38:9  “My master the sovereign, these men
have done evil in all that they have done to Yirmeyahu the prophet, whom they
have thrown into the dungeon, and he is likely to die from hunger in the place
where he is, for there is no more bread in the city.” 
Jer
38:10  And the sovereign commanded Eḇeḏ-Meleḵ
the Kushite, saying, “Take thirty men from here with you, and lift Yirmeyahu
the prophet out of the dungeon before he dies.” 
Jer
38:11  So Eḇeḏ-Meleḵ
took the men with him and went into the house of the sovereign under the
treasury, and took old clothes and old rags from there, and let them down by
ropes into the dungeon to Yirmeyahu. 
Jer
38:12  And Eḇeḏ-Meleḵ
the Kushite said to Yirmeyahu, “Please put these old clothes and rags under
your armpits, under the ropes.” And Yirmeyahu did so, 
Jer
38:13  and they pulled Yirmeyahu up with
ropes and lifted him out of the dungeon. And Yirmeyahu remained in the court of
the guard. 
Jer
38:14  Then Tsiḏqiyahu the
sovereign sent and had Yirmeyahu the prophet brought to him at the third
entrance of the House of יהוה. And the sovereign said
to Yirmeyahu, “I am asking you a matter. Do not hide a matter from me.” 
Jer
38:15  And Yirmeyahu said to Tsiḏqiyahu,
“If I declare it to you, shall you not put me to death? And if I give you
advice, you shall not listen to me.” 
Jer
38:16  But Tsiḏqiyahu the sovereign
swore secretly to Yirmeyahu, saying, “As יהוה lives,
who made us this life, I do not put you to death, nor do I give you into the
hand of these men who seek your life.” 
Jer
38:17  And Yirmeyahu said to Tsiḏqiyahu,
“Thus said יהוה, the Elohim of hosts, the Elohim of
Yisra’ĕl, ‘If you do indeed surrender to the heads of the sovereign of Baḇel,
then your being shall live, and this city not be burned with fire. And you and
your house shall live. 
Jer
38:18  ‘But if you do not surrender to
the heads of the sovereign of Baḇel, then this city shall be given into
the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and you shall not
escape from their hand.’ ” 
Jer
38:19  Then Tsiḏqiyahu the
sovereign said to Yirmeyahu, “I am afraid of the Yehuḏim who have gone
over to the Chaldeans, lest they give me into their hand, and they maltreat me.”

Jer
38:20  But Yirmeyahu said, “They shall
not hand you over. Please, obey the voice of יהוה which
I speak to you, and let it be well with you, and your life be spared. 
Jer
38:21  “But if you refuse to surrender,
this is the word that יהוה has shown me: 
Jer
38:22  ‘Then see, all the women who are
left in the sovereign of Yehuḏah’s house shall be surrendered to the
heads of the sovereign of Baḇel, and see, they are saying, “Your close
friends have set upon you and prevailed against you; your feet have sunk in the
mire; they have turned away again.” 
Jer
38:23  ‘And they are going to surrender
all your wives and children to the Chaldeans, and you yourself shall not escape
from their hand, but be taken by the hand of the sovereign of Baḇel, and
this city shall be burned with fire.’ ” 
Jer
38:24  Then Tsiḏqiyahu said to
Yirmeyahu, “Let no one know of these words, and you shall not die. 
Jer
38:25  “But if the heads hear that I have
spoken with you, and they come to you and say to you, ‘Declare to us now what
you have said to the sovereign, and also what the sovereign said to you. Do not
hide it from us, and we do not put you to death,’ 
Jer
38:26  then you shall say to them, ‘I
presented my petition before the sovereign, not to send me back to the house of
Yonathan to die there.’ ” 
Jer
38:27  And all the heads came to
Yirmeyahu and asked him. And he informed them according to all these words that
the sovereign had commanded. And they said no more to him, for the matter was
not heard. 
Jer
38:28  So Yirmeyahu remained in the court
of the guard until the day that Yerushalayim was taken, and he was there when Yerushalayim was taken. 
Jer
39:1  In the ninth year of Tsiḏqiyahu
sovereign of Yehuḏah, in the tenth month, Neḇuḵaḏretstsar
sovereign of Baḇel and all his army came against Yerushalayim, and
besieged it. 
Jer
39:2  In the eleventh year of Tsiḏqiyahu,
in the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, the city was broken into. 
Jer
39:3  And all the heads of the sovereign
of Baḇel came in and sat in the Middle Gate: Nĕrḡal-Shar’etser,
Samgar-Neḇo, Sarseḵim, Raḇsaris, Nĕrḡal-Sarezer,
Raḇmaḡ, and all the rest of the heads of the sovereign of Baḇel.

Jer
39:4  And it came to be, when Tsiḏqiyahu
the sovereign of Yehuḏah and all the men of battle saw them, they fled
and left the city by night, by way of the sovereign’s garden, by the gate
between the two walls. And he went out toward the desert plain. 
Jer
39:5  But the army of the Chaldeans
pursued them and overtook Tsiḏqiyahu in the desert plains of
Yeriḥo. And they captured him, and brought him up to Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar
sovereign of Baḇel, to Riḇlah in the land of Ḥamath, where he
spoke judgment on him. 
Jer
39:6  And the sovereign of Baḇel
slew the sons of Tsiḏqiyahu before his eyes in Riḇlah. The
sovereign of Baḇel also slew all the nobles of Yehuḏah. 
Jer
39:7  And he put out the eyes of Tsiḏqiyahu,
and bound him with bronze shackles to bring him to Baḇel. 
Jer
39:8  And the Chaldeans burned the house
of the sovereign and the houses of the people with fire, and they broke down
the walls of Yerushalayim. 
Jer
39:9  And Neḇuzaraḏan, chief
of the guard, exiled to Baḇel the remnant of the people who remained in
the city and those who defected to him, with the rest of the people who were
left. 
Jer
39:10  But Neḇuzaraḏan, chief
of the guard, left in the land of Yehuḏah the poor people, who had naught
whatever, and gave them vineyards and fields on the same day. 
Jer
39:11  And Neḇuḵaḏretstsar
the sovereign of Baḇel gave an order concerning Yirmeyahu to Neḇuzaraḏan,
chief of the guard, saying, 
Jer
39:12  “Take him and look after him, and
do no harm whatsoever to him, but do to him even as he shall speak to you.” 
Jer
39:13  And Neḇuzaraḏan, chief
of the guard, and Neḇushazban the Raḇsaris, Nĕrḡal-Shar’etser
the Raḇmaḡ, and all the sovereign of Baḇel’s chief officers
sent, 
Jer
39:14  and had Yirmeyahu taken from the
court of the guard, and gave him to Geḏalyahu son of Aḥiqam, son of
Shaphan, to take him home. And he dwelt among the people. 
Jer
39:15  And the word of יהוה
had come to Yirmeyahu while he was shut up in the court of the guard, saying, 
Jer
39:16  “Go, and you shall speak to Eḇeḏ-Meleḵ
the Kushite, saying, ‘Thus said יהוה of hosts, the
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, “See, I am bringing My words upon this city for evil
and not for good, and they shall be before you in that day. 
Jer
39:17  “And I shall deliver you in that
day,” declares יהוה, “so that you are not given into
the hand of the men of whom you are afraid. 
Jer
39:18  “For I shall rescue you, and you
shall not fall by the sword. But your life shall be as a prize to you, for you
have put your trust in Me,” declares יהוה.’ ” 
Jer
40:1  The word that came to Yirmeyahu
from יהוה after Neḇuzaraḏan, chief of the
guard, had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him bound in chains among
all the exiles from Yerushalayim and Yehuḏah, who were being exiled to Baḇel.

Jer
40:2  And the chief of the guard took
Yirmeyahu and said to him, “ יהוה your Elohim has
spoken this evil on this place. 
Jer
40:3  “And יהוה
has brought it on, and has done, as He has said. Because you have sinned
against יהוה, and did not obey His voice, therefore
this matter has come upon you. 
Jer
40:4  “And now, see, I loosen you today
from the chains that were on your hand. If it seems good to you to come with me
to Baḇel, come, and I shall look after you. But if it seems wrong for you
to come with me to Baḇel, remain here. See, all the land is before you,
go wherever it seems good and right for you to go.” 
Jer
40:5  And before he replied, Neḇuzaraḏan said, “Or go
back to Geḏalyah son of Aḥiqam, son of Shaphan, whom the sovereign
of Baḇel has made governor over the cities of Yehuḏah, and dwell
with him among the people, or go wherever it seems right for you to go.” And
the chief of the guard gave him provisions and a gift and let him go. 
Jer
40:6  So Yirmeyahu went to Geḏalyah
son of Aḥiqam, to Mitspah, and dwelt with him among the people who were
left in the land. 
Jer
40:7  And all the commanders of the
armies who were in the fields, they and their men, heard that the sovereign of
Baḇel had made Geḏalyahu son of Aḥiqam governor in the land,
and had put him in charge of the men, and women, and children, and the poor of
the land who had not been exiled to Baḇel. 
Jer
40:8  So they came to Geḏalyah at
Mitspah – Yishma‛ĕl the son of Nethanyahu, and Yoḥanan and
Yonathan the sons of Qarĕaḥ, and Serayah the son of Tanḥumeth,
and the sons of Ophai the Netophathite and Yezanyahu the son of a Ma‛aḵathite,
they and their men. 
Jer
40:9  And Geḏalyahu son of
Aḥiqam, son of Shaphan, swore to them and their men, saying, “Do not be
afraid of serving the Chaldeans. Dwell in the land and serve the sovereign of
Baḇel, and it shall be well with you. 
Jer
40:10  “And I, see, I am dwelling at
Mitspah, to serve the Chaldeans who come to us. But you, gather wine and summer
fruit and oil, and put them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities which you
have taken.” 
Jer
40:11  Also, when all the Yehuḏim
who were in Mo’aḇ, and among the Ammonites, and in Eḏom, and who
were in all the lands, heard that the sovereign of Baḇel had left a
remnant of Yehuḏah, and that he had set over them Geḏalyahu son of
Aḥiqam, son of Shaphan, 
Jer
40:12  then all the Yehuḏim
returned from all the places where they had been driven, and came to the land
of Yehuḏah, to Geḏalyahu at Mitspah, and gathered wine and summer
fruit in large quantities. 
Jer
40:13  And Yoḥanan son of Qarĕaḥ
and all the commanders of the army that were in the fields came to Geḏalyahu
at Mitspah, 
Jer
40:14  and they said to him, “Do you know
that Ba‛alis sovereign of the Ammonites has sent Yishma‛ĕl son
of Nethanyah to take your life?” But Geḏalyahu son of Aḥiqam would
not believe them. 
Jer
40:15  Then Yoḥanan son of Qarĕaḥ
spoke secretly to Geḏalyahu in Mitspah, saying, “Please let me go and
smite Yishma‛ĕl son of Nethanyah, without anyone knowing it. Why
should he murder you, and so let all the Yehuḏim who are gathered to you
be scattered, and the remnant in Yehuḏah perish?”
Jer
40:16  But Geḏalyahu son of
Aḥiqam said to Yoḥanan son of Qarĕaḥ, “Do not do this
matter, for what you are saying about Yishma‛ĕl is not true.” 
Jer
41:1  And in the seventh month it came to
be that Yishma‛ĕl son of Nethanyah, son of Elishama, of the royal
seed, and of the officers of the sovereign, came with ten men to Geḏalyahu
son of Aḥiqam, at Mitspah. And while they ate bread together there in
Mitspah, 
Jer
41:2  Yishma‛ĕl son of
Nethanyah, and the ten men who were with him, arose and smote Geḏalyahu
son of Aḥiqam, son of Shaphan, with the sword, and killed him whom the
sovereign of Baḇel had made governor over the land. 
Jer
41:3  And Yishma‛ĕl smote all
the Yehuḏim who were with him, with Geḏalyahu at Mitspah, and the
Chaldeans who were found there, the men of battle. 
Jer
41:4  And it came to be, on the second
day after he had killed Geḏalyahu, when no one yet knew it, 
Jer
41:5  that men came from Sheḵem,
from Shiloh, and from Shomeron, eighty men with their beards shaved and their
garments torn, having cut themselves, with offerings and incense in their hand,
to bring them to the House of יהוה. 
Jer
41:6  And Yishma‛ĕl son of
Nethanyah went out from Mitspah to meet them, weeping as he walked along. And
it came to be, as he met them, that he said to them, “Come to Geḏalyahu
son of Aḥiqam!” 
Jer
41:7  And it came to be, when they came
inside the city, that Yishma‛ĕl son of Nethanyah slew them, throwing them into a pit, he and the men
who were with him. 
Jer
41:8  But ten men were found among them
who said to Yishma‛ĕl, “Do not kill us, for we have wheat, and
barley, and oil, and honey hidden in the field.” So he held back and did not
kill them among their brothers. 
Jer
41:9  And the pit into which Yishma‛ĕl
had thrown all the corpses of the men whom he had slain, because of Geḏalyahu,
was the same one Asa the sovereign had made for fear of Ba‛asha sovereign
of Yisra’ĕl – Yishma‛ĕl son of Nethanyahu had filled it with
the slain. 
Jer
41:10  Then Yishma‛ĕl took
captive all the rest of the people who were in Mitspah, the sovereign’s
daughters and all the people who were left in Mitspah, whom Neḇuzaraḏan,
chief of the guard, had entrusted to Geḏalyahu son of Aḥiqam. And
Yishma‛ĕl son of Nethanyahu took them captive and went to go over to
the Ammonites. 
Jer
41:11  But Yoḥanan son of Qarĕaḥ
and all the commanders of the army that were with him heard of all the evil
that Yishma‛ĕl son of Nethanyah had done, 
Jer
41:12  so they took all the men and went
to fight with Yishma‛ĕl son of Nethanyah. And they found him by the
great pool that is in Giḇ‛on. 
Jer
41:13  And it came to be, when all the
people who were with Yishma‛ĕl saw Yoḥanan son of Qarĕaḥ,
and all the commanders of the army who were with him, that they were glad. 
Jer
41:14  And all the people whom Yishma‛ĕl
had taken captive from Mitspah turned around, and came back, and went to
Yoḥanan son of Qarĕaḥ. 
Jer
41:15  But Yishma‛ĕl the son
of Nethanyah escaped from Yoḥanan with eight men and went to the
Ammonites. 
Jer
41:16  Then Yoḥanan son of Qarĕaḥ,
and all the commanders of the army that were with him, took from Mitspah all
the rest of the people whom he had recovered from Yishma‛ĕl son of
Nethanyah after he had murdered Geḏalyah son of Aḥiqam – the mighty
men of battle and the women and the children and the eunuchs, whom he had
brought back from Giḇ‛on. 
Jer
41:17  And they set out and dwelt in the
lodging place of Kimham, which is near Bĕyth Leḥem, to go to enter
Mitsrayim,
Jer
41:18  because of the Chaldeans. For they
were afraid of them, because Yishma‛ĕl son of Nethanyah had smitten
Geḏalyahu son of Aḥiqam, whom the sovereign of Baḇel had made
governor in the land. 
Jer
42:1  Then all the commanders of the
army, and Yoḥanan son of Qarĕaḥ, and Yezanyah son of Hoshayah,
and all the people, from the least to the greatest, came near 
Jer
42:2  and said to Yirmeyahu the prophet, “We
beg you, let our petition be acceptable to you, and pray for us to יהוה
your Elohim, for all this remnant, for we are few left of many, as your eyes
see us. 
Jer
42:3  “And let יהוה
your Elohim show us the way in which we should walk and the word we should do.”

Jer
42:4  And Yirmeyahu the prophet said to
them, “I have heard. See, I am praying to יהוה your
Elohim according to your words, and it shall be that I declare to you all the
word יהוה answers you. I withhold not a word from you.”

Jer
42:5  And they said to Yirmeyahu, “Let יהוה
be a true and steadfast witness between us, if we do not do according to all
the word which יהוה your Elohim sends us by you. 
Jer
42:6  “Whether good or evil, let us obey
the voice of יהוה our Elohim to whom we send you, in
order that it might be well with us when we obey the voice of יהוה
our Elohim.” 
Jer
42:7  And after ten days it came to be
that the word of יהוה came to Yirmeyahu. 
Jer
42:8  So he called Yoḥanan son of
Qarĕaḥ, and all the commanders of the army which were with him, and
all the people from the least even to the greatest, 
Jer
42:9  and said to them, “Thus said יהוה,
the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, to whom you sent me to present your petition
before Him, 
Jer
42:10  ‘If you would indeed stay in this
land, then I shall build you and not pull you down, and I shall plant you and not
pluck you up. For I have relented of the evil I have done to you. 
Jer
42:11  ‘Do not be afraid of the sovereign
of Baḇel, of whom you are afraid. Do not be afraid of him,’ declares יהוה,
‘for I am with you, to save you and deliver you from his hand. 
Jer
42:12  ‘And I shall show you compassion,
so that he has compassion on you and let you return to your own land.’ 
Jer
42:13  “But if you say, ‘We are not
staying in this land,’ and so disobey the voice of יהוה
your Elohim, 
Jer
42:14  saying, ‘No, but we are going to
the land of Mitsrayim so that we see no fighting, nor hear the sound of the ram’s
horn, nor hunger for bread, and there we shall stay,’ 
Jer
42:15  then hear the word of יהוה,
O remnant of Yehuḏah! Thus said יהוה of hosts,
the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, ‘If you indeed set your faces to enter Mitsrayim,
and shall go to sojourn there, 
Jer
42:16  then it shall be that the sword
which you feared overtakes you there in the land of Mitsrayim, and the scarcity
of food of which you were afraid clings to you there in Mitsrayim, and you die
there. 
Jer
42:17  ‘And so it shall be with all the
men who set their faces to go to Mitsrayim to sojourn there: they shall die by
the sword, by scarcity of food, and by pestilence, and not one of them shall
survive or escape from the evil I am bringing upon them.’ 
Jer
42:18  “For thus said יהוה
of hosts, the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, ‘As My displeasure and My wrath have
been poured out on the inhabitants of Yerushalayim, so shall My wrath be poured
out on you when you enter Mitsrayim. And you shall be an oath, and an
astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach, and you shall see this place no
more.’ 
Jer
42:19  “ יהוה has
spoken about you, O remnant of Yehuḏah, ‘Do not go to Mitsrayim!’ Know
for certain that I have warned you this day. 
Jer
42:20  “For you deceived yourselves when
you sent me to יהוה your Elohim, saying, ‘Pray for us
to יהוה our Elohim, and according to all that יהוה
your Elohim says, so declare to us and we shall do it.’ 
Jer
42:21  “So I have declared it to you
today, but you have not obeyed the voice of יהוה your
Elohim in all which He has sent me to you. 
Jer
42:22  “And now, know for certain that
you shall die by the sword, by scarcity of food, and by pestilence in the place
where you have desired to go to sojourn.” 
Jer
43:1  And it came to be, when Yirmeyahu
had ended speaking all these words to all the people – all the words of יהוה
their Elohim, for which יהוה their Elohim had sent him
to them – 
Jer
43:2  that Azaryah son of Hoshayah, and
Yoḥanan son of Qarĕaḥ, and all the proud men spoke, saying to
Yirmeyahu, “You are speaking a lie! יהוה our Elohim has
not sent you to say, ‘Do not go to Mitsrayim to sojourn there.’ 
Jer
43:3  “For Baruḵ son of Nĕriyah
is moving you against us, to give us into the hand of the Chaldeans, to put us
to death or exile us to Baḇel.” 
Jer
43:4  So Yoḥanan son of Qarĕaḥ,
and all the commanders of the army, and all the people disobeyed the voice of יהוה,
to stay in the land of Yehuḏah. 
Jer
43:5  And Yoḥanan son of Qarĕaḥ
and all the commanders of the army took all the remnant of Yehuḏah who
had returned to dwell in the land of Yehuḏah, from all nations where they
had been driven – 
Jer
43:6  the men, and the women, and the
children, and the sovereign’s daughters, and every being whom Neḇuzaraḏan,
chief of the guard, had left with Geḏalyahu son of Aḥiqam, son of
Shaphan, and Yirmeyahu the prophet, and Baruḵ son of Nĕriyahu. 
Jer
43:7  So they went to the land of
Mitsrayim, for they disobeyed the voice of יהוה. And
they went as far as Taḥpanḥes. 
Jer
43:8  And the word of יהוה
came to Yirmeyahu in Taḥpanḥes, saying, 
Jer
43:9  “Take large stones in your hand,
and you shall hide them before the eyes of the men of Yehuḏah, in the
clay in the brick courtyard which is at the entrance to Pharaoh’s house in
Taḥpanḥes. 
Jer
43:10  “Then you shall say to them, ‘Thus
said יהוה of hosts, the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, “See,
I am sending, and I shall bring Neḇuḵaḏretstsar the sovereign
of Baḇel, My servant. And I shall set his throne above these stones that
I have hidden. And he shall spread his canopy over them. 
Jer
43:11  “And he shall come and smite the
land of Mitsrayim, bringing death to
those appointed for death, and
captivity to those for captivity, and the sword to those for the sword. 
Jer
43:12  “And he shall set fire to the
houses of the mighty ones of Mitsrayim. And he shall burn them and take them
captive. And he shall cover himself with the land of Mitsrayim, as a shepherd
puts on his garment, and he shall go out from there in peace. 
Jer
43:13  “And he shall break the stone
pillars of the House of the Sun which are in the land of Mitsrayim, and he
shall burn the houses of the mighty ones of the Mitsrites with fire.” ’ ” 
Jer
44:1  The word that came to Yirmeyahu
concerning all the Yehuḏim who were dwelling in the land of Mitsrayim –
who were dwelling at Miḡdol, and at Taḥpanḥes, and at Noph,
and in the land of Pathros, saying, 
Jer
44:2  “Thus said יהוה
of hosts, the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, ‘You yourselves have seen all the evil
that I have brought on Yerushalayim and on all the cities of Yehuḏah. And
see, this day they are a ruin, and no one dwells in them, 
Jer
44:3  because of their evil which they
have done to provoke Me, by going to burn incense by serving other mighty ones
whom they did not know, they nor you nor your fathers. 
Jer
44:4  ‘And I sent to you all My servants
the prophets, rising early and sending them, saying, “Please do not do this
abominable matter that I hate!” 
Jer
44:5  ‘But they did not listen or incline
their ear, to turn from their evil, not to burn incense to other mighty ones. 
Jer
44:6  ‘So My wrath and My displeasure
were poured out and burned in the cities of Yehuḏah and in the streets of
Yerushalayim, and they became a ruin and a wasteland, as it is this day.’ 
Jer
44:7  “And now, thus said יהוה,
the Elohim of hosts, the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, ‘Why are you doing this great
evil against your lives, to cut off from you man and woman, child and infant,
from the midst of Yehuḏah, leaving none to remain, 
Jer
44:8  by provoking Me with the works of
your hands, by burning incense to other mighty ones in the land of Mitsrayim
where you have gone to dwell, to cut yourselves off and be a curse and a
reproach among all the nations of the earth? 
Jer
44:9  ‘Have you forgotten the evils of
your fathers, and the evils of the sovereigns of Yehuḏah, and the evils
of their wives, and your own evils, and the evils of your wives, which they
have done in the land of Yehuḏah and in the streets of Yerushalayim? 
Jer
44:10  ‘To this day they have not been
humbled, nor have they feared, nor have they walked in My Torah and in My laws
that I set before you and your fathers.’ 
Jer
44:11  “Therefore thus said יהוה
of hosts, the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, ‘See, I am setting My face against you
for evil and for cutting off all Yehuḏah. 
Jer
44:12  ‘And I shall take the remnant of
Yehuḏah who have set their faces to go into the land of Mitsrayim to
sojourn there. And they shall all be consumed in the land of Mitsrayim – fall
by the sword, consumed by scarcity of food. From the least to the greatest they
shall die, by the sword and by scarcity of food. And they shall be an oath and
an astonishment and a curse and a reproach! 
Jer
44:13  ‘And I shall punish those dwelling
in the land of Mitsrayim, as I have punished Yerushalayim, by the sword, by
scarcity of food, and by pestilence. 
Jer
44:14  ‘And none of the remnant of Yehuḏah
who have gone into the land of Mitsrayim to sojourn there shall escape or
survive, lest they return to the land of Yehuḏah, to which they are
longing to return to dwell there. For they shall not return, except those who
escape.’ ” 
Jer
44:15  Then all the men who knew that
their wives had burned incense to other mighty ones, and all the women who
stood by, a great assembly, and all the people who dwelt in the land of
Mitsrayim, in Pathros, answered Yirmeyahu, saying, 
Jer
44:16  “We are not going to listen to you
in the matter about which you spoke to us in the Name of יהוה
! 
Jer
44:17  “But we shall do whatever has gone
out of our own mouth, to burn incense to the sovereigness of the heavens and
pour out drink offerings to her, as we have done, we and our fathers, our
sovereigns and our heads, in the cities of Yehuḏah and in the streets of
Yerushalayim. And we had plenty of food, and were well-off, and saw no evil. 
Jer
44:18  “But since we ceased burning
incense to the sovereigness of the heavens and pouring out drink offerings to
her, we have lacked all and have been consumed by the sword and by scarcity of
food. 
Jer
44:19  “And when we burned incense to the
sovereigness of the heavens and poured out drink offerings to her, did we make
cakes for her, to idolize her, and pour out drink offerings to her, without our
husbands?” 
Jer
44:20  Then Yirmeyahu spoke to all the
people – to the men and to the women, and to all the people who had given him
that answer, saying, 
Jer
44:21  “As for the incense that you
burned in the cities of Yehuḏah and in the streets of Yerushalayim, you
and your fathers, your sovereigns and your heads, and the people of the land,
did not יהוה remember them? And it came into His heart!

Jer
44:22  “And יהוה
could no longer bear it, because of the evil of your deeds and because of the
abominations which you did. Therefore your land is a ruin, an object of
astonishment, a curse, and without an inhabitant, as it is this day. 
Jer
44:23  “Because you have burned incense
and because you have sinned against יהוה, and did not
obey the voice of יהוה or walk in His Torah, in His
laws or in His witnesses, therefore this evil did befall you, as at this day.” 
Jer
44:24  And Yirmeyahu said to all the
people and to all the women, “Hear the word of יהוה,
all Yehuḏah who are in the land of Mitsrayim! 
Jer
44:25  “Thus spoke יהוה
of hosts, the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, saying, ‘You and your wives have spoken
with your mouths, and have filled with your hands, saying, “We shall perform
our vows that we have made, to burn incense to the sovereigness of the heavens
and pour out drink offerings to her.” Then confirm your vows and perform your
vows!’ 
Jer
44:26  “Therefore hear the word of יהוה,
all Yehuḏah who are dwelling in the land of Mitsrayim, ‘See, I have sworn
by My great Name,’ declares יהוה, ‘My Name shall no
longer be called upon by the mouth of any man of Yehuḏah in all the land
of Mitsrayim, saying, “As the Master יהוה lives...” 
Jer
44:27  ‘See, I am watching over them for
evil and not for good. And all the men of Yehuḏah who are in the land of
Mitsrayim shall be consumed by the sword and by scarcity of food, until they
come to an end. 
Jer
44:28  ‘And those who escape the sword,
few in number, shall return from the land of Mitsrayim to the land of Yehuḏah.
And all the remnant of Yehuḏah, who came into the land of Mitsrayim to sojourn
there, shall know whose word is established, Mine or theirs. 
Jer
44:29  ‘And this is the sign to you,’
declares יהוה, ‘that I am punishing you in this place,
so that you know that My words are certainly established against you for evil.’

Jer
44:30  “Thus said יהוה,
‘See, I am giving Pharaoh Ḥophra sovereign of Mitsrayim into the hand of
his enemies and into the hand of those who seek his life, as I gave Tsiḏqiyahu
sovereign of Yehuḏah into the hand of Neḇuḵaḏretstsar
sovereign of Baḇel, his enemy who sought his life.’ ” 
Jer
45:1  The word that Yirmeyahu the prophet
spoke to Baruḵ son of Nĕriyah, when he had written these words in a
book from the mouth of Yirmeyahu, in the fourth year of Yehoyaqim son of
Yoshiyahu, sovereign of Yehuḏah, saying, 
Jer
45:2  “Thus said יהוה,
the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, concerning you, Baruḵ: 
Jer
45:3  ‘You have said, “Woe to me now! For
יהוה has added grief to my pain. I have been wearied
with my sighing, and I have found no rest.” ’ 
Jer
45:4  “Say this to him, ‘Thus said יהוה,
“See, what I have built I am breaking down, and what I have planted I am
plucking up, that is, the entire land. 
Jer
45:5  “And do you seek great matters for
yourself? Do not seek them, for look, I am bringing evil on all flesh,”
declares יהוה. “But I shall give your life to you as a
prize in all places, wherever you go.” ’ ” 
Jer
46:1  The word of יהוה
which came to Yirmeyahu the prophet concerning the gentiles: 
Jer
46:2  For Mitsrayim, concerning the army
of Pharaoh Neḵo, sovereign of Mitsrayim, which was by the River Euphrates
in Karkemish, and which Neḇuḵaḏretstsar the sovereign of Baḇel
had smitten in the fourth year of Yehoyaqim, son of Yoshiyahu, sovereign of
Yehuḏah: 
Jer
46:3  “Prepare the large and the small
shield, and draw near to battle! 
Jer
46:4  “Harness the horses, and mount up,
you horsemen! Stand with helmets, polish the spears, put on the armour! 
Jer
46:5  “Why do I see them afraid, turned
back? And their fighters are beaten down. And they have fled in haste, and did
not look back, for fear was all around,” declares יהוה.

Jer
46:6  Do not let the swift flee away, nor
the mighty man escape. They shall stumble and fall toward the north, by the
River Euphrates. 
Jer
46:7  Who is this rising like a flood,
whose waters surge about like the rivers? 
Jer
46:8  Mitsrayim rises like a flood, and
its waters surge about like the rivers. And he says, ‘Let me rise and cover the
earth; let me destroy the city and its inhabitants.’ 
Jer
46:9  Go up, O horses, and rage, O
chariots! And let the mighty men go forth – Kush and Put who handle the shield,
and Luḏ who handle and bend the bow. 
Jer
46:10  For this is the day of the Master יהוה
of hosts, a day of vengeance, to revenge Himself on His adversaries. And the
sword shall devour, and be satisfied and made drunk with their blood. For the
Master יהוה of hosts has a slaughtering in the land of
the north by the River Euphrates. 
Jer
46:11  Go up to Gil‛aḏ and
take balm, O maiden, the daughter of Mitsrayim. In vain you have used many
remedies, there is no healing for you. 
Jer
46:12  Nations have heard of your shame,
and your cry has filled the land. For the mighty has stumbled against the
mighty, they have both fallen together. 
Jer
46:13  The word which יהוה
spoke to Yirmeyahu the prophet, about the coming of Neḇuḵaḏretstsar
sovereign of Baḇel, to smite the land of Mitsrayim: 
Jer
46:14  “Declare in Mitsrayim, and let it
be heard in Miḡdol. And let it be heard in Noph and in
Taḥpanḥes. Say, ‘Stand fast and be prepared, for a sword shall
devour all around you.’ 
Jer
46:15  “Why were your strong ones swept
away? They did not stand because יהוה drove them away. 
Jer
46:16  “He made many stumble; indeed,
they fell over each other, and said, ‘Arise! Let us go back to our own people,
and to the land of our birth, away from the oppressing sword.’ 
Jer
46:17  “There they cried, ‘Pharaoh,
sovereign of Mitsrayim, is but a noise. He has let the appointed time pass by!’

Jer
46:18  “As I live,” declares the
Sovereign, whose Name is יהוה of hosts, “For as Taḇor
is among the mountains, and as Karmel by the sea, he shall come. 
Jer
46:19  “O you daughter dwelling in
Mitsrayim, prepare yourself to go into exile! For Noph shall become a waste and
a ruin, and be burned, without inhabitant. 
Jer
46:20  “Mitsrayim is like a very pretty
heifer, but destruction comes, it comes from the north. 
Jer
46:21  “Her hired ones too, in her midst,
are like fattened calves, for they too shall turn, they shall flee away
together. They shall not stand, for the day of their calamity has come upon
them, the time of their punishment. 
Jer
46:22  “Its sound moves along like a
serpent, for they move on like an army and come against her with axes, like
woodcutters. 
Jer
46:23  “They shall cut down her forest,”
declares יהוה, “for it is not searched, because they
are more numerous than locusts, and without number. 
Jer
46:24  “The daughter of Mitsrayim shall
be put to shame. She shall be given into the hand of the people of the north.” 
Jer
46:25  יהוה of
hosts, the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, has said, “See, I am bringing punishment on
Amon of No, and on Pharaoh, and on Mitsrayim, and on their mighty ones, and on
their sovereigns, and on Pharaoh and on those trusting in him. 
Jer
46:26  “And I shall give them into the
hand of those who seek their lives, into the hand of Neḇuḵaḏretstsar
sovereign of Baḇel and into the hand of his servants. And afterward it
shall be inhabited as in the days of old,” declares יהוה.
Jer
46:27  “But as for you, do not fear, O My
servant Ya‛aqoḇ, and do not be discouraged, O Yisra’ĕl! For
look, I am saving you from afar, and your descendants from the land of their
captivity. And Ya‛aqoḇ shall return, and shall have rest and be at
ease, with no one disturbing. 
Jer
46:28  “Do not fear, O Ya‛aqoḇ
My servant,” declares יהוה, “for I am with you. Though
I make a complete end of all the gentiles to which I have driven you, yet I do
not make a complete end of you. But I shall reprove you in right-ruling, and by
no means leave you unpunished.”
Jer
47:1  The word of יהוה
that came to Yirmeyahu the prophet concerning the Philistines, before Pharaoh
smote Azzah: 
Jer
47:2  Thus said יהוה,
“See, waters are rising out of the north, and shall be an overflowing flood.
And they shall overflow the land and all that is in it, the city and those who
dwell within. And men shall cry, and all the inhabitants of the land shall
wail.  
Jer
47:3  “At the noise of the stamping
hooves of his strong horses, at the rushing of his chariots, at the rumbling of
his wheels, the fathers shall not look to their children, because of weakness
of hands, 
Jer
47:4  because of the day that shall come
to ravage all the Philistines, to cut off from Tsor and Tsiḏon every
helper that survives. For יהוה is ravaging the
Philistines, the remnant of the isle of Kaphtor. 
Jer
47:5  “Baldness shall come upon Azzah,
Ashqelon shall be cut off with the remnant of their valley. Till when would you
cut yourself? 
Jer
47:6  “O you sword of יהוה,
how long till you rest? Put yourself up into your sheath, rest and be still! 
Jer
47:7  “How shall it rest, when יהוה
has given it a command? Against Ashqelon and against the seashore – there He
has appointed it.” 
Jer
48:1  Concerning Mo’aḇ. This is
what יהוה of hosts, the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl said, “Woe
to Neḇo! For it is ravaged, Qiryathayim is put to shame, captured. The
high stronghold is put to shame and broken down. 
Jer
48:2  “There is praise for Mo’aḇ no
longer. In Ḥeshbon they have devised evil against her, ‘Come and let us
cut it off as a nation.’ O Maḏmĕn, you are also cut off, a sword
goes after you. 
Jer
48:3  “Listen! An outcry from Ḥoronayim,
ravaging and great destruction! 
Jer
48:4  “Mo’aḇ shall be destroyed,
her little ones shall cry out. 
Jer
48:5  “For on the ascent to Luḥith
they go up weeping bitterly. For in the descent of Ḥoronayim the enemies
shall hear a cry of destruction. 
Jer
48:6  “Flee, deliver your own lives! And
be like a bush in the wilderness. 
Jer
48:7  “For because you have trusted in
your works and your treasures, you shall be captured. And Kemosh shall go forth
into exile, his priests and his heads together. 
Jer
48:8  “And a ravager shall come into
every city, no one escapes. And the valley shall perish, and the plain be
destroyed, as יהוה has spoken. 
Jer
48:9  “Give wings to Mo’aḇ, for she
has to flee away, and her cities become a ruin, with no one to dwell in them. 
Jer
48:10  (Cursed is he who is slack in
doing the work of יהוה, and cursed is he who withholds
his sword from blood). 
Jer
48:11  “Mo’aḇ has been at ease from
his youth, and he has settled on his dregs, and has not been emptied from
vessel to vessel, nor has he gone into exile. Therefore his flavour has stayed
in him, and his fragrance is unchanged. 
Jer
48:12  “Therefore see, the days are coming,”
declares יהוה, “when I shall send him tilters, who
shall tilt him over and empty his vessels and break the bottles. 
Jer
48:13  “And Mo’aḇ shall be ashamed
because of Kemosh, as the house of Yisra’ĕl was ashamed of Bĕyth Ĕl,
their refuge. 
Jer
48:14  “How do you say, ‘We are mighty
and strong men for battle’? 
Jer
48:15  “Mo’aḇ is ravaged and her
cities have been entered. And her chosen young men have gone down to the
slaughter,” declares the Sovereign, whose Name is יהוה
of hosts. 
Jer
48:16  “The calamity of Mo’aḇ is
near to come and his affliction hurries fast. 
Jer
48:17  “Lament for him, all you who are
around him. And all you who know his name, say, ‘How the strong sceptre has
been broken, the staff of splendour!’ 
Jer
48:18  “Come down from your esteem, and
sit in thirst, O inhabitant, daughter of Diḇon. For the ravager of Mo’aḇ
shall come against you, he shall destroy your strongholds. 
Jer
48:19  “Stand by the way and watch, O
inhabitant of Aro‛ĕr. Ask him who flees and her who escapes; say, ‘What
has been done?’ 
Jer
48:20  “Mo’aḇ has been put to
shame, for it has been broken down. Howl and cry! Let it be heard in Arnon that
Mo’aḇ is ravaged. 
Jer
48:21  “And judgment has come on the
plain country, on Ḥolon and on Yaḥtsah and on Mopha‛ath, 
Jer
48:22  and on Diḇon and Neḇo
and on Bĕyth Diḇlathayim, 
Jer
48:23  and on Qiryathayim and on Bĕyth
Gamul and on Bĕyth Me‛on, 
Jer
48:24  and on Qeriyoth and on Botsrah,
and on all the cities of the land of Mo’aḇ, far or near. 
Jer
48:25  “The horn of Mo’aḇ has been
cut off, and his arm has been broken,” declares יהוה. 
Jer
48:26  “Make him drunk, because he has
made himself great against יהוה. Mo’aḇ shall
splash in his vomit, and he shall also be in mockery. 
Jer
48:27  “And was not Yisra’ĕl a
mockery to you? Was he found among thieves? For whenever you speak of him, you
shake your head. 
Jer
48:28  “O inhabitants of Mo’aḇ,
leave the cities and dwell in the rock, and be like the dove making a nest in
the sides of the cave’s mouth. 
Jer
48:29  “We have heard of the pride of Mo’aḇ
(he is very proud!), of his loftiness and arrogance and pride, and of the
haughtiness of his heart.” 
Jer
48:30  “I know his wrath,” declares יהוה,
“and his boastings are untrue, and
his deeds are false. 
Jer
48:31  “Therefore I wail for Mo’aḇ,
and I cry out for all Mo’aḇ. I mourn for the men of Qir Ḥeres. 
Jer
48:32  “O vine of Siḇmah! I weep
for you with the weeping of Ya‛zĕr. Your branches have passed over
the sea, they have come to the sea of Ya‛zĕr. The ravager has fallen
on your summer fruit and your grape harvest. 
Jer
48:33  “Joy and gladness have been taken
away from the orchard and from the land of Mo’aḇ. And I have made wine to
cease from the winepresses. No one treads with shouting – the shouting is no
shouting! 
Jer
48:34  “From the outcry of Ḥeshbon
unto El‛alĕh, unto Yahats, they shall raise their voice, from Tso‛ar
to Ḥoronayim, like a three-year-old heifer, for even the waters of Nimrim
are dried up. 
Jer
48:35  “And I shall make an end in Mo’aḇ
to him who offers in the high places and burns incense to his mighty ones,”
declares יהוה. 
Jer
48:36  “So My heart sounds for Mo’aḇ
like flutes, and My heart sounds for the men of Qir Ḥeres like flutes.
Therefore the wealth they made shall be gone. 
Jer
48:37  “For every head is bald, and every
beard clipped – cuts on all the hands, and sackcloth on the loins. 
Jer
48:38  “On all the house-tops of Mo’aḇ
and in its streets it is all lamentation, for I have broken Mo’aḇ like a
vessel in which no one delights,” declares יהוה. 
Jer
48:39  “How has she been broken down!
They shall wail! How has Mo’aḇ turned her back with shame! So Mo’aḇ
shall be a mockery and a horror to all those about her.” 
Jer
48:40  For thus said יהוה,
“See, he soars like an eagle, and shall spread his wings over Mo’aḇ. 
Jer
48:41  “Qeriyoth shall be captured, and
the strongholds seized. And the heart of the mighty men in Mo’aḇ on that
day shall be like the heart of a woman in labour. 
Jer
48:42  “And Mo’aḇ shall be
destroyed as a people, because he has made himself great against יהוה.

Jer
48:43  “Fear and the pit and the snare
are upon you, O inhabitant of Mo’aḇ,” declares יהוה.

Jer
48:44  “He who flees from the fear falls
into the pit, and he who gets out of the pit is caught in the snare. For I am
bringing upon Mo’aḇ the year of their punishment,” declares יהוה.

Jer
48:45  “Those who fled stood powerless
under the shadow of Ḥeshbon. But a fire shall come out of Ḥeshbon,
and a flame from the midst of Siḥon, and consume the brow of Mo’aḇ
and the crown of the head of the sons of uproar. 
Jer
48:46  “Woe to you, O Mo’aḇ! The
people of Kemosh have perished, for your sons have been taken into exile, and
your daughters into exile. 
Jer
48:47  “But I shall turn back the
captivity of Mo’aḇ in the latter days,” declares יהוה.
Thus far is the judgment of Mo’aḇ. 
Jer
49:1  Concerning the Ammonites: Thus said
יהוה, “Has Yisra’ĕl no sons? Has he no heir? Why
has Malkam taken possession of Gaḏ, and his people dwell in its cities? 
Jer
49:2  “Therefore see, the days are coming,”
declares יהוה, “when I shall sound a battle cry in
Rabbah of the Ammonites. And it shall be a heap, a wasteland, and her villages
shall be burned with fire. Then Yisra’ĕl shall dispossess those who
dispossessed him,” declares יהוה. 
Jer
49:3  “Howl, O Ḥeshbon, for Ai is
ravaged! Cry, daughters of Rabbah, gird on sackcloth! Lament and diligently
search by the walls, for Malkam shall go into exile, with his priests and his
heads. 
Jer
49:4  “Why do you boast in the valleys,
your flowing valley, O backsliding daughter who is trusting in her treasures,
saying, ‘Who would come against me?’ 
Jer
49:5  “See, I am bringing fear upon you,
from all those around you,” declares the Master יהוה of
hosts. “And you shall be driven out, each one straight ahead, with no one to
bring home the wanderer. 
Jer
49:6  “And after this I turn back the
captivity of the children of Ammon,” declares יהוה. 
Jer
49:7  Concerning Eḏom: Thus said יהוה
of hosts, “Is there no more wisdom in Tĕman? Has counsel been lost to
those with understanding? Has their wisdom vanished? 
Jer
49:8  “Flee, turn back, dwell in the
depths, O inhabitants of Deḏan! For I shall bring the calamity of Ĕsaw
upon him, the time that I shall punish him. 
Jer
49:9  “If grape-gatherers came to you,
would they not leave some gleaning grapes? Even thieves by night would destroy only until they had enough! 
Jer
49:10  “But as for Me, I shall make Ĕsaw
bare. I shall uncover his hiding places, so that he is unable to conceal
himself. His seeds is ravaged, his brothers and his neighbours, and he is no
more. 
Jer
49:11  “Leave your fatherless children,
let Me keep them alive. And let your widows trust in Me.” 
Jer
49:12  For thus said יהוה,
“See, those whose judgment was not to drink of the cup have certainly drunk.
And are you the one to go unpunished? You shall not go unpunished, but
certainly drink of it. 
Jer
49:13  “For I have sworn by Myself,”
declares יהוה, “that Botsrah is to become a ruin, a
reproach, a waste, and a curse, and all its cities become everlasting wastes.” 
Jer
49:14  I have heard a report from יהוה,
and an envoy has been sent to the nations, “Gather together, come against her,
and rise up to battle! 
Jer
49:15  “For look, I shall make you small
among nations, despised among men. 
Jer
49:16  “The dread for you, the pride of
your heart, has deceived you, O you who dwell in the clefts of the rock,
holding the height of the hill! Though you make your nest as high as the eagle,
from there I bring you down,” declares the Master. 
Jer
49:17  “And Eḏom shall be a ruin,
everyone who passes by it is astonished and whistles at all its plagues. 
Jer
49:18  “As in the overthrow of Seḏom
and Amorah and their neighbouring cities,” declares יהוה,
“No one shall dwell there, nor would a son of man sojourn in it. 
Jer
49:19  “See, he comes up like a lion from
the Yardĕn jungle against the home of the strong. But in an instant I
shall make him run away from her. And who is the Chosen One, to appoint over
her? For who is like Me? And who summons Me? And who is that Shepherd who
stands before Me?” 
Jer
49:20  Therefore hear the counsel of יהוה
which He has counselled concerning Eḏom, and the purposes He has purposed
concerning the inhabitants of Tĕman: the least of the flock shall drag
them away! He shall make their pasture a waste before them! 
Jer
49:21  The earth shall be shaken at the
noise of their fall. There is an outcry! Its noise is heard at the Sea of
Reeds. 
Jer
49:22  See, like an eagle he flies up,
and spreads his wings over Botsrah. And the heart of the mighty men of Eḏom
in that day shall be like the heart of a woman in her pain. 
Jer
49:23  Concerning Damascus: “Ḥamath
and Arpaḏ have been put to shame, for they have heard an evil report.
They have been melted in anxiety, like the sea, unable to rest. 
Jer
49:24  “Damascus has become feeble, she
has turned to flee, and trembling has seized her. Distress and pain have taken
hold of her like a woman in labour. 
Jer
49:25  “How is the city of praise
deserted, the city of My joy! 
Jer
49:26  “Therefore her young men fall in
her streets, and all the men of battle are cut off in that day,” declares יהוה
of hosts. 
Jer
49:27  “And I shall kindle a fire in the
wall of Damascus, and it shall consume the palaces of Ben-Haḏaḏ.” 
Jer
49:28  To Qĕḏar and to the
reigns of Ḥatsor, which Neḇuḵaḏretstsar sovereign of Baḇel
smote: Thus said יהוה, “Arise, go up to Qĕḏar,
and ravage the men of the East! 
Jer
49:29  “Their tents and their flocks,
their curtains and all their vessels shall be taken. And they shall take away
their camels for themselves. And they shall cry out to them, ‘Fear is on every
side!’ 
Jer
49:30  “Flee, go away! Dwell in the
depths, O inhabitants of Ḥatsor!” declares יהוה. “For
Neḇuḵaḏretstsar sovereign of Baḇel has taken counsel
against you, and has devised a plan against you. 
Jer
49:31  “Arise, go up to the nation at
ease that dwells safely,” declares יהוה. “It has no
gates or bars, they dwell alone. 
Jer
49:32  “And their camels shall become
plunder, and their large herds booty. And I shall scatter them to all winds,
those who cut off the corner, and bring their calamity from all its sides,”
declares יהוה. 
Jer
49:33  “Ḥatsor shall be a
habitation for jackals, a desert forever. No one dwells there, nor does son of
man sojourn in it.” 
Jer
49:34  The word of יהוה
that came to Yirmeyahu the prophet concerning Ĕylam, in the beginning of
the reign of Tsiḏqiyah, the sovereign of Yehuḏah, saying, 
Jer
49:35  “Thus said יהוה
of hosts, ‘See, I am breaking the bow of Ĕylam, the chief of their might. 
Jer
49:36  ‘And I shall bring upon Ĕylam
the four winds from the four quarters of the heavens, and scatter them toward
all those winds. And there shall be no nation where the outcasts of Ĕylam
do not go. 
Jer
49:37  ‘And I shall break Ĕylam
before their enemies and before those who seek their life. And I shall bring
evil upon them, my burning displeasure,’ declares יהוה.
‘And I shall send the sword after them until I have consumed them. 
Jer
49:38  ‘And I shall set My throne in Ĕylam,
and destroy from there the sovereign and the heads,’ declares יהוה.

Jer
49:39  ‘And it shall be in the latter
days that I turn back the captivity of Ĕylam,’ declares יהוה.”

Jer
50:1  The word that יהוה
spoke concerning Baḇel, concerning the land of the Chaldeans by Yirmeyahu
the prophet. 
Jer
50:2  “Declare among the nations, and let
it be heard. And lift up a banner, let it be heard, and do not conceal it. Say,
‘Baḇel shall be taken, Bĕl shall be put to shame, Meroḏaḵ
shall be broken, her images shall be put to shame, her idols shall be broken.’ 
Jer
50:3  For a nation shall come up against
her from the north, which shall make her land waste, and none shall dwell in
it. They shall flee, they shall go, both man and beast. 
Jer
50:4  “In those days and at that time,”
declares יהוה, “the children of Yisra’ĕl shall
come, they and the children of Yehuḏah together, weeping as they come,
and seek יהוה their Elohim. 
Jer
50:5  “They shall ask the way to Tsiyon,
their faces toward it, ‘Come and let us join ourselves to יהוה,
in an everlasting covenant, never to be forgotten.’ 
Jer
50:6  “My people have been wandering
sheep. Their shepherds have led them astray, turning them away on the
mountains. They have gone from mountain to hill, they have forgotten their
resting place.
Jer
50:7  “All who found them have devoured
them. And their adversaries have said, ‘We are not guilty, because they have
sinned against יהוה, the Home of righteousness, and the
Expectation of their fathers: יהוה.’ 
Jer
50:8  “Flee from the midst of Baḇel,
come out of the land of the Chaldeans. And be as rams before a flock.
Jer
50:9  “For look, I am stirring up and
bringing up against Baḇel an assembly of great nations from a land of the
north, and they shall array themselves against her. From there she shall be
captured – their arrows are like those of a mighty skilled man, not returning
empty-handed. 
Jer
50:10  “And Chaldea shall become plunder,
all who plunder her shall satisfy themselves,” declares יהוה.

Jer
50:11  “Because you were glad, because
you rejoiced, you who plunder My inheritance, because you have grown fat like a
heifer threshing grain, and you neigh like stallions, 
Jer
50:12  your mother shall be greatly
ashamed. She who bore you shall be humiliated. Look, the last of the nations, a
wilderness, a dry land and a desert. 
Jer
50:13  “Because of the wrath of יהוה
she shall not be inhabited, but she shall be deserted – all of it. Everyone
passing by Baḇel shall be astonished and whistle at all her plagues. 
Jer
50:14  “Set yourselves in array against
Baḇel all around, all you who bend the bow. Shoot at her, spare no
arrows, for she has sinned against יהוה. 
Jer
50:15  “Shout against her all around. She
has given her hand, her foundations have fallen, her walls are thrown down, for
it is the vengeance of יהוה. Take vengeance on her. As
she has done, so do to her. 
Jer
50:16  “Cut off the sower from Baḇel,
and him who handles the sickle at harvest time. From before the sword of the
oppressor each one turns to his own people, and each one flees to his own land.

Jer
50:17  “Yisra’ĕl is a scattered
sheep, the lions have driven him away. First the sovereign of Ashshur devoured
him, and now, at last, this Neḇuḵaḏretstsar sovereign of Baḇel
has broken his bones.” 
Jer
50:18  Therefore thus said יהוה
of hosts, the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, “See, I am punishing the sovereign of Baḇel
and his land, as I have punished the sovereign of Ashshur. 
Jer
50:19  “And I shall bring back Yisra’ĕl
to his pasture, and he shall feed on Karmel and Bashan. And his being shall be
satisfied on Mount Ephrayim and Gil‛aḏ. 
Jer
50:20  “In those days and at that time,”
declares יהוה, “the crookedness of Yisra’ĕl shall
be searched for, but there shall be none; and the sin of Yehuḏah, but
none shall be found. For I shall pardon those whom I leave as a remnant. 
Jer
50:21  “Go up against the land of
Merathayim, against it, and against the inhabitants of Peqoḏ. Slay and
put them under the ban,” declares יהוה, “and do
according to all that I have commanded you. 
Jer
50:22  “There is a sound of battle in the
land, and of great destruction. 
Jer
50:23  “How the hammer of all the earth
has been cut off and broken! How Baḇel has become a ruin among the
nations! 
Jer
50:24  “I have laid a snare for you, and
you were captured, O Baḇel, and you yourself did not know! You have been
found and also caught, because you strove against יהוה.”

Jer
50:25  יהוה has
opened His armoury, and has brought out the weapons of His displeasure, for the
Master Elohim of hosts has a work to do in the land of the Chaldeans. 
Jer
50:26  Come against her from every
quarter, open her storehouses, pile her up as heaps of ruins, and put her under
the ban. Let her have no remnant. 
Jer
50:27  Slay all her bulls, let them go
down to the slaughter. Woe to them! For their day has come, the time of their
punishment. 
Jer
50:28  Listen! They flee and escape from
the land of Baḇel, to declare in Tsiyon the vengeance of יהוה
our Elohim, the vengeance of His Hĕḵal. 
Jer
50:29  “Summon archers against Baḇel.
All you who bend the bow, encamp against it all around, let no one escape.
Repay her according to her work, do to her according to all she has done. For
she has been proud against יהוה, against the Set-apart
One of Yisra’ĕl. 
Jer
50:30  “Therefore her young men shall
fall in the streets, and all her men of battle shall perish in that day,”
declares יהוה. 
Jer
50:31  “See, I am against you, O proud
one!” declares the Master יהוה of hosts, “for your day
has come, the time for your punishment. 
Jer
50:32  “And the proud one shall stumble,
and he shall fall, with no one to raise him up. And I shall kindle a fire in
his cities, and it shall devour all around him.” 
Jer
50:33  Thus said יהוה
of hosts, “The children of Yisra’ĕl were oppressed, along with the
children of Yehuḏah. And all who took them captive have held them fast,
they refused to let them go. 
Jer
50:34  “Their Redeemer is strong, יהוה
of hosts is His Name. He shall strongly plead their case, so as to give rest to
the land, but unrest to the inhabitants of Baḇel. 
Jer
50:35  “A sword is upon the Chaldeans,”
declares יהוה, “and it is upon the inhabitants of Baḇel,
and upon her heads and upon her wise men. 
Jer
50:36  “A sword is upon the liars, and
they shall be fools. A sword is upon her mighty men, and they shall be broken
down. 
Jer
50:37  “A sword is upon their horses, and
upon their chariots, and upon all the mixed peoples who are in her midst, and
they shall become like women. A sword is upon her treasures, and they shall be
plundered. 
Jer
50:38  “A sword is upon her waters, and
they shall be dried up. For it is a land of carved images, and they boast about
their idols. 
Jer
50:39  “Therefore the wild desert beasts
shall dwell with the jackals, and the ostriches dwell in it. And it shall never
again be inhabited, nor dwelt in, unto all generations. 
Jer
50:40  “As Elohim overthrew Seḏom
and Amorah and their neighbouring cities,” declares יהוה,
“so no one would dwell there, nor would son of man sojourn in it. 
Jer
50:41  “See, a people shall come from the
north, and a great nation and many sovereigns stirred up from the ends of the
earth. 
Jer
50:42  “They lay hold of bow and spear,
they are cruel and they show no compassion. They sound like the roaring sea,
and ride on horses, set in array, like a man for the battle, against you, O
daughter of Baḇel. 
Jer
50:43  “The sovereign of Baḇel has
heard the report about them, and his hands became weak. Distress has seized
him, pain like that of a woman in labour. 
Jer
50:44  “See, he comes up like a lion from
the Yardĕn jungle, against the enduring pasture. But in an instant I shall
make them run away from her. And who is the Chosen One whom I appoint against
her? For who is like Me? Who summons Me? And who is that Shepherd who stands
before Me?” 
Jer
50:45  Therefore hear the counsel of יהוה
which He has counselled concerning Baḇel, and His purposes He has
purposed concerning the land of the Chaldeans: the least of the flock shall
drag them away! He shall make their pasture a waste before them! 
Jer
50:46  At the sound of Baḇel’s
capture the earth shall be shaken, and the outcry shall be heard among the
nations. 
Jer
51:1  Thus said יהוה,
“See, I am stirring up the spirit of a destroyer against Baḇel, against
those who dwell in Lĕb – My opponents.
Jer
51:2  And I shall send winnowers to Baḇel,
who shall winnow her and empty her land. For they shall be against her all
around, in the day of evil. 
Jer
51:3  “Let the archer draw his bow, and
let him stand ready in his armour. Do not spare her young men, put all her army
under the ban. 
Jer
51:4  “And the slain shall fall in the
land of the Chaldeans, and the pierced-through in her streets. 
Jer
51:5  “For neither Yisra’ĕl nor Yehuḏah
is widowed by his Elohim, יהוה of hosts, though their
land has been filled with sin against the Set-apart One of Yisra’ĕl.” 
Jer
51:6  Flee from the midst of Baḇel,
and let each one save his life! Do not be cut off in her crookedness, for this
is the time of the vengeance of יהוה, the recompense He
is repaying her.
Jer
51:7  Baḇel was a golden cup in the
hand of יהוה, making drunk all the earth. The nations
drank her wine, that is why the nations went mad!
Jer
51:8  Baḇel shall suddenly fall and
be broken. Howl for her! Take balm for her pain – if so be, she might be
healed. 
Jer
51:9  We would have healed Baḇel,
but she is not healed. Let us leave her and each go to his own land, for her
judgment reaches to the heavens and is lifted up to the clouds. 
Jer
51:10  יהוה has
brought forth our righteousness. Come and let us relate in Tsiyon the work of יהוה
our Elohim. 
Jer
51:11  Polish the arrows! Put on the
shields! יהוה has stirred up the spirit of the
sovereigns of the Medes. For His plan is against Baḇel to destroy it,
because it is the vengeance of יהוה, the vengeance for
His Hĕḵal. 
Jer
51:12  Lift up a banner on the walls of
Baḇel, strengthen the watch, station the watchmen, prepare the ambush.
For יהוה has both planned and done what He spoke
concerning the inhabitants of Baḇel. 
Jer
51:13  You who dwell upon many waters,
great in treasures, your end has come, the measure of your greedy gain. 
Jer
51:14  יהוה of
hosts has sworn by Himself, “I shall certainly fill you with men, as with
locusts, and they shall lift up a shout against you.” 
Jer
51:15  He made the earth by His power, He
established the world by His wisdom, and stretched out the heavens by His
understanding. 
Jer
51:16  When He gives forth His voice the
waters in the heavens roar, and He makes vapours to ascend from the ends of the
earth; He makes lightnings for the rain, and He brings the wind out of His
treasuries. 
Jer
51:17  All mankind has become too brutish
to know, every smith has been put to shame by the carved image, for his moulded
image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them. 
Jer
51:18  They are worthless, a work of mockery.
In the time of their punishment they perish. 
Jer
51:19  The Portion of Ya‛aqoḇ
is not like them, for He is the Maker of all, and Yisra’ĕl is the tribe of
His inheritance. יהוה of hosts is His Name. 
Jer
51:20  “You are My battle-axe, weapons of
battle, and with you I shall break nations in pieces, and with you I shall
destroy reigns. 
Jer
51:21  “And with you I shall break in
pieces the horse and its rider, and with you I shall break in pieces the
chariot and its rider. 
Jer
51:22  “And with you I shall break in
pieces man and woman, and with you I shall break in pieces old and young, and
with you I shall break in pieces the young man and the maiden. 
Jer
51:23  “And with you I shall break in
pieces the shepherd and his flock, and with you I shall break in pieces the
farmer and his yoke of oxen. And with you I shall break in pieces governors and
rulers. 
Jer
51:24  “And I shall repay Baḇel and
all the inhabitants of Chaldea for all the evil they have done in Tsiyon before
your eyes,” declares יהוה. 
Jer
51:25  “See, I am against you, O
destroying mountain, who destroys all the earth,” declares יהוה.
“And I shall stretch out My hand against you. And I shall roll you down from
the rocks, and make you a burnt mountain. 
Jer
51:26  “And they shall not take from you
a stone for a corner nor a stone for a foundation, but you shall be a waste
forever,” declares יהוה. 
Jer
51:27  Lift up a banner in the land, blow
the ram’s horn among the nations! Prepare the nations against her, call the
reigns together against her: Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz. Appoint a commander
against her, bring up horses like hairy locusts. 
Jer
51:28  Separate the nations against her,
with the sovereigns of the Medes, its governors and all its rulers, all the
land of his rule, 
Jer
51:29  so that the land shakes and
writhes in pain. For every plan of יהוה shall be
established against Baḇel, to make the land of Baḇel a ruin,
without inhabitant. 
Jer
51:30  The mighty men of Baḇel have
ceased to fight, they remained in their strongholds. Their might has failed,
they became like women, they have burned her dwelling places. The bars of her
gate have been broken. 
Jer
51:31  One runner runs to meet another,
and one reporter to meet another, to report to the sovereign of Baḇel
that his city is taken on all sides, 
Jer
51:32  and the fords have been captured,
and they have burned the reeds with fire, and the soldiers are startled. 
Jer
51:33  For thus said יהוה
of hosts, the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, “The daughter of Baḇel is like a
threshing-floor at the time it is trodden. Yet a little while and the time of
her harvest shall come.” 
Jer
51:34  “Neḇuḵaḏretstsar
the sovereign of Baḇel has devoured us, he has crushed us, he has made us
an empty vessel, he has swallowed us up like a monster. He has filled his
stomach with my delicacies, he has driven us away. 
Jer
51:35  “Let the violence done to me and
my flesh be upon Baḇel,” says the inhabitant of Tsiyon. And, “Let my
blood be upon the inhabitants of Chaldea,” says Yerushalayim. 
Jer
51:36  Therefore thus said יהוה,
“See, I am pleading your case. And I shall take vengeance for you and dry up
her sea and make her fountain dry. 
Jer
51:37  “And Baḇel shall become a
heap, a habitation of jackals, an astonishment and a hissing, without
inhabitant. 
Jer
51:38  “Together they roar like lions,
they shall growl like lions’ cubs. 
Jer
51:39  “In their heat I prepare their
feasts. And I shall make them drunk, so that they rejoice, and sleep a
neverending sleep and not awake,” declares יהוה. 
Jer
51:40  “I shall bring them down like
lambs to the slaughter, like rams with male goats. 
Jer
51:41  “Oh, how Shĕshaḵ has
been captured, the praise of all the earth been seized! How Baḇel has
become a ruin among the nations! 
Jer
51:42  “The sea has risen over Baḇel,
she has been covered with the roaring of its waves. 
Jer
51:43  “Her cities have become a ruin, a
dry land and a desert, a land where no one dwells, neither does son of man pass
by it. 
Jer
51:44  “And I shall punish Bĕl in Baḇel.
And I shall make him spew out what he has swallowed, and nations shall no
longer stream to him. Even the wall of Baḇel shall fall. 
Jer
51:45  “Come out of her midst, My people!
And let everyone deliver his being from the burning displeasure of יהוה.
Jer
51:46  “And lest your heart grow faint,
and you fear the report heard in the land – for a report shall come one year,
and after that, in another year a report shall come, and violence in the land,
ruler against ruler – 
Jer
51:47  therefore see, the days are coming
that I shall bring punishment on the carved images of Baḇel, and all her
land shall be put to shame, and all her slain fall in her midst. 
Jer
51:48  “And the heavens and the earth and
all that is in them shall shout for joy over Baḇel, for the ravagers shall
come to her from the north,” declares יהוה. 
Jer
51:49  As Baḇel is to fall for the
slain of Yisra’ĕl, so for Baḇel the slain of all the earth shall
fall. 
Jer
51:50  You who have escaped the sword, go
away! Do not stand still! Remember יהוה from afar, and
let Yerushalayim come to your heart. 
Jer
51:51  We are ashamed because we have
heard reproach. Shame has covered our faces, for strangers have come into the
set-apart places of the House of יהוה.
Jer
51:52  “Therefore see, the days are
coming,” declares יהוה, “that I shall bring punishment
on her carved images, while the wounded groan throughout all her land. 
Jer
51:53  “Though Baḇel should mount
up to the heavens, and though she should make the height of her strength
inaccessible, ravagers shall come to her from Me,” declares יהוה.

Jer
51:54  Listen! A cry from Baḇel,
and great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans, 
Jer
51:55  because יהוה
is ravaging Baḇel, and shall silence her loud voice. And her waves shall
roar like great waters, the noise of their voice shall resound, 
Jer
51:56  because the ravager shall come
against her, against Baḇel, and her mighty men shall be captured. Every
one of their bows shall be broken, for יהוה is the Ĕl
of recompense, He shall certainly repay. 
Jer
51:57  “And I shall make her rulers
drunk, and her wise men, her governors, and her deputies, and her mighty men.
And they shall sleep a lasting sleep, and not awake,” declares the Sovereign,
whose Name is יהוה of hosts. 
Jer
51:58  Thus said יהוה
of hosts, “The broad walls of Baḇel are completely demolished, and her
high gates are burned with fire, and peoples labour in vain, and the nations
weary themselves for fire.” 
Jer
51:59  The word that Yirmeyahu the
prophet commanded Serayah son of Nĕriyah, son of Maḥsĕyah, when
he went with Tsiḏqiyahu the sovereign of Yehuḏah to Baḇel in
the fourth year of his reign. And Serayah was a quartermaster. 
Jer
51:60  So Yirmeyahu wrote in a book all
the evil that would come upon Baḇel, all these words which have been
written concerning Baḇel. 
Jer
51:61  And Yirmeyahu said to Serayah, “When
you come to Baḇel and see it, and read all these words, 
Jer
51:62  then you shall say, ‘O יהוה,
You have spoken concerning this place to cut it off, so that none shall dwell
in it, neither man nor beast, for it is a ruin forever.’ 
Jer
51:63  “And it shall be, when you have
ended reading this book, that you shall tie a stone to it and throw it into the
midst of the Euphrates, 
Jer
51:64  and shall say, ‘So does Baḇel
sink and not rise from the evil that I am bringing upon her, and they shall
weary themselves.’ ” Thus far are the words of Yirmeyahu. 
Jer
52:1  Tsiḏqiyahu was twenty-one
years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Yerushalayim.
And his mother’s name was Ḥamutal the daughter of Yirmeyahu of Liḇnah.

Jer
52:2  And he did evil in the eyes of יהוה,
according to all that Yehoyaqim had done. 
Jer
52:3  For through the displeasure of יהוה
this came to be against Yerushalayim and Yehuḏah, until He had cast them
out from His presence. And Tsiḏqiyahu rebelled against the sovereign of
Baḇel. 
Jer
52:4  And it came to be in the ninth year
of his reign, in the tenth month, on the tenth of the month, that Neḇuḵaḏretstsar
sovereign of Baḇel and all his army came against Yerushalayim and
encamped against it. And they built a siege wall against it all around. 
Jer
52:5  And the city was under siege until
the eleventh year of Sovereign Tsiḏqiyahu. 
Jer
52:6  On the ninth of the fourth month
the scarcity of food was so severe in the city that there was no food for the
people of the land. 
Jer
52:7  Then the city wall was breached,
and all the men of battle fled and went out of the city at night by way of the
gate between the two walls, which was by the sovereign’s garden, while the
Chaldeans were near the city all around. And they went by way of the desert
plain. 
Jer
52:8  But the army of the Chaldeans
pursued the sovereign, and they overtook Tsiḏqiyahu in the desert plains
of Yeriḥo, and his entire army was scattered from him. 
Jer
52:9  Then they captured the sovereign
and brought him up to the sovereign of Baḇel at Riḇlah in the land
of Ḥamath, and he pronounced judgments on him. 
Jer
52:10  And the sovereign of Baḇel
slew the sons of Tsiḏqiyahu before his eyes, and he also slew all the
heads of Yehuḏah in Riḇlah. 
Jer
52:11  And he put out the eyes of Tsiḏqiyahu.
And the sovereign of Baḇel bound him in bronze shackles, and took him to
Baḇel, and put him in prison till the day of his death. 
Jer
52:12  And on the tenth of the fifth
month, which was the nineteenth year of sovereign Neḇuḵaḏretstsar
sovereign of Baḇel, Neḇuzaraḏan, chief of the guard, who
served the sovereign of Baḇel, came to Yerushalayim, 
Jer
52:13  and he burned the House of יהוה,
and the sovereign’s house, and all the houses of Yerushalayim, and all the
houses of the great men, he burned with fire. 
Jer
52:14  And all the army of the Chaldeans
who were with the chief of the guard broke down all the walls of Yerushalayim
all around. 
Jer
52:15  And Neḇuzaraḏan, chief
of the guard, exiled some of the poor people, and the rest of the people who
were left in the city, and the defectors who had gone over to the sovereign of
Baḇel, and the rest of the craftsmen. 
Jer
52:16  But Neḇuzaraḏan, chief
of the guard, left some of the poor of the land as vinedressers and farmers. 
Jer
52:17  And the Chaldeans broke the bronze
columns that were in the House of יהוה, and the stands
and the bronze Sea that were in the House of יהוה, and
brought all their bronze to Baḇel. 
Jer
52:18  They also took away the pots, and
the shovels, and the snuffers, and the bowls, and the ladles, and all the
bronze utensils with which they served, 
Jer
52:19  and the basins, and the fire
holders, and the bowls, and the pots, and the lampstands, and the ladles, and
the cups, whatever was of solid gold and whatever was of solid silver, the
chief of the guard took.
Jer
52:20  The two columns, one Sea, the
twelve bronze bulls which were under it, and the stands, which Sovereign
Shelomoh had made for the House of יהוה – the bronze of
all these vessels was beyond weighing. 
Jer
52:21  As for the columns, the height of
one column was eighteen cubits, and its circumference was twelve cubits, and
its thickness was four fingers, hollow. 
Jer
52:22  And a capital of bronze was on it.
And the height of one capital was five cubits, with a network and pomegranates
all around the capital, all of bronze. And the second column, with pomegranates
was the same. 
Jer
52:23  And there were ninety-six
pomegranates on the sides. All the pomegranates on the network were one
hundred, all around. 
Jer
52:24  And the chief of the guard took
Serayah the chief priest, and Tsephanyah the second priest, and the three
doorkeepers. 
Jer
52:25  And from the city he took one
eunuch who was in charge of the men of battle, and seven men who saw the
sovereign’s face, who were found in the city, and the scribe of the commander
of the army who mustered the people of the land, and sixty men of the people of
the land who were found in the city. 
Jer
52:26  And Neḇuzaraḏan, chief
of the guard, took these and brought them to the sovereign of Baḇel at Riḇlah,

Jer
52:27  and the sovereign of Baḇel
smote them and put them to death at Riḇlah in the land of Ḥamath.
Thus Yehuḏah was exiled from its own land. 
Jer
52:28  These are the people whom Neḇuḵaḏretstsar
exiled: in the seventh year, three thousand and twenty-three Yehuḏim; 
Jer
52:29  in the eighteenth year of Neḇuḵaḏretstsar
he exiled from Yerushalayim eight hundred and thirty-two beings; 
Jer
52:30  in the twenty-third year of Neḇuḵaḏretstsar,
Neḇuzaraḏan, chief of the guard, exiled of the Yehuḏim seven
hundred and forty-five beings. All the beings were four thousand six hundred. 
Jer
52:31  And it came to be in the
thirty-seventh year of the exile of Yehoyaḵin sovereign of Yehuḏah,
in the twelfth month, on the twenty-fifth of the month, that Ewil-Meroḏaḵ
sovereign of Baḇel, in the first year of his reign, lifted up the head of
Yehoyaḵin sovereign of Yehuḏah and brought him out of prison, 
Jer
52:32  and spoke kindly to him and set
his throne above those of the sovereigns who were with him in Baḇel. 
Jer
52:33  So he changed his prison garments,
