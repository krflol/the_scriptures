Yoḥanan Gimel/3 John
3John
1:1  The elder, to the beloved Gaios,
whom I love in truth: 
3John
1:2  Beloved ones, I pray for you to do
well in every way, and be in health, as your life is doing well. 
3John
1:3  For I rejoiced greatly when brothers
came and witnessed of the truth in you, as you walk in the truth. 
3John
1:4  I have no greater joy than to hear
of my children walking in truth. 
3John
1:5  Beloved ones, you are acting
trustworthily in whatever you do for the brothers and for strangers, 
3John
1:6  who have borne witness of your love
before the assembly. If you send them forward worthily of Elohim, you shall do
well, 
3John
1:7  because they went out for the sake
of the Name, receiving naught from the gentiles. 
3John
1:8  Therefore we ought to receive such,
so that we become fellow workers for the truth. 
3John
1:9  I wrote to the assembly, but
Diotrephes, who loves to be the first among them, does not receive us. 
3John
1:10  So if I come, I shall call to mind
his works which he does, babbling against us with wicked words. And not
satisfied with that, he himself does not receive the brothers, and forbids
those who wish to, putting them out of the assembly. 
3John
1:11  Beloved ones, do not imitate the
evil, but the good. The one who is doing good is of Elohim, but he who is doing
evil has not seen Elohim.
3John
1:12  Demetrios has a good witness from
all, and from the truth itself. And we also bear witness, and you know that our
witness is true. 
3John
1:13  I had much to write, but I do not
wish to write to you with pen and ink, 
3John
1:14  but I expect to see you shortly,
and we shall speak face to face. Peace to you. The friends greet you. Greet the
friends by name.
