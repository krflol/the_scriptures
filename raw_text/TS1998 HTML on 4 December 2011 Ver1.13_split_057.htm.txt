Qorintiyim Aleph/1 Corinthians
1Cor
1:1  Sha’ul, a called emissary of יהושע
Messiah by the desire of Elohim, and brother Sosthenes, 
1Cor
1:2  to the assembly of Elohim which is
at Corinth, to those who are set-apart in Messiah יהושע,
called set-apart ones, with all those calling on the Name of יהושע
Messiah our Master in every place, theirs and ours: 
1Cor
1:3  Favour to you and peace from Elohim
our Father and the Master יהושע Messiah. 
1Cor
1:4  I thank my Elohim always concerning
you for the favour of Elohim which was given to you by Messiah יהושע,

1Cor
1:5  that in Him you were enriched in all
– in every word and all knowledge – 
1Cor
1:6  as the witness of Messiah was
confirmed in you, 
1Cor
1:7  so that you are not lacking in any
gift, eagerly waiting for the revelation of our Master יהושע
Messiah, 
1Cor
1:8  who shall also confirm you to the
end, unreprovable in the day of our Master יהושע
Messiah. 
1Cor
1:9  Elohim is trustworthy, by whom you
were called into the fellowship of His Son, יהושע
Messiah our Master. 
1Cor
1:10  And I appeal to you, brothers, by
the Name of our Master יהושע Messiah, that you
all agree, and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be knit
together in the same mind and in the same opinion. 
1Cor
1:11  For I have been informed concerning
you, my brothers, by those of the house
of Chloe, that there are strifes among you.
1Cor
1:12  What I mean is this, that each one
of you says, “I am of Sha’ul,” or “I am of Apollos,” or “I am of Kĕpha,”
or “I am of Messiah.” 
1Cor
1:13  Has the Messiah been divided? Was
Sha’ul impaled for you? Or were you immersed in the name of Sha’ul? 
1Cor
1:14  I thank Elohim that I immersed not
one of you except Crispus and Gaios, 
1Cor
1:15  that no one should say that I
immersed into my own name. 
1Cor
1:16  Now I did also immerse the
household of Stephanas. For the rest, I do not know whether I immersed anyone
else. 
1Cor
1:17  For Messiah did not send me to
immerse, but to bring the Good News, not with wisdom of words, that the stake
of Messiah should not be nullified. 
1Cor
1:18  For the word of the stake is indeed
foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the
power of Elohim. 
1Cor
1:19  For it has been written, “I shall
destroy the wisdom of the wise, and set aside the learning of the learned ones.”
1Cor
1:20  Where is the wise? Where is the
scholar? Where is the debater of this age? Has not Elohim made foolish the
wisdom of this world? 
1Cor
1:21  For since, in the wisdom of Elohim,
the world through wisdom did not know Elohim, it pleased Elohim through the
foolishness of preaching to save those who believe. 
1Cor
1:22  And since Yehuḏim ask a sign,
and Greeks seek wisdom, 
1Cor
1:23  yet we proclaim Messiah impaled, to
the Yehuḏim a stumbling-block and to the Greeks foolishness, 
1Cor
1:24  but to those who are called – both
Yehuḏim and Greeks – Messiah the power of Elohim and the wisdom of
Elohim. 
1Cor
1:25  For the foolishness of Elohim is
wiser than men, and the weakness of Elohim is stronger than men. 
1Cor
1:26  For look at your calling, brothers,
that there were not many wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, not many
noble. 
1Cor
1:27  But Elohim has chosen the foolish matters of the world to put to shame the
wise, and Elohim has chosen the weak of the world to put to shame the strong. 
1Cor
1:28  And Elohim has chosen the low-born
of the world and the despised, and the ones that are not, that He might bring
to naught the ones that are, 
1Cor
1:29  so that no flesh should boast in
His presence. 
1Cor
1:30  And of Him you are in Messiah יהושע,
who became for us wisdom from Elohim, righteousness also, and set-apartness and
redemption,
1Cor
1:31  that, as it has been written, “He
who boasts, let him boast in יהוה.” 
1Cor
2:1  And, when I came to you, brothers, I
did not come with excellence of speech or wisdom, proclaiming to you the
witness of Elohim. 
1Cor
2:2  For I resolved not to know any matter among you except יהושע
Messiah and Him impaled. 
1Cor
2:3  And I was with you in weakness, and
in fear, and in much trembling. 
1Cor
2:4  And my word and my preaching were
not with persuasive words of man’s wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit
and of power, 
1Cor
2:5  in order that your belief should not
be in the wisdom of men but in the power of Elohim. 
1Cor
2:6  Yet we speak wisdom among those who
are perfect, and not the wisdom of this age, nor of the rulers of this age that
are being brought to naught. 
1Cor
2:7  But we speak the wisdom of Elohim,
which was hidden in a secret, and which Elohim ordained before the ages for our
esteem, 
1Cor
2:8  which no one of the rulers of this
age knew, for if they had known, they would not have impaled the Master of
esteem. 
1Cor
2:9  But as it has been written, “Eye has
not seen, and ear has not heard, nor have entered into the heart of man what
Elohim has prepared for those who love Him.”
1Cor
2:10  But Elohim has revealed them to us
through His Spirit. For the Spirit searches all matters, even the depths of Elohim. 
1Cor
2:11  For who among men knows the thoughts of a man except the spirit of
the man that is in him? So also, the thoughts
of Elohim no one has known, except the Spirit of Elohim. 
1Cor
2:12  And we have received, not the spirit
of the world, but the Spirit that is from Elohim, in order to know what Elohim
has favourably given us, 
1Cor
2:13  which we also speak, not in words
which man’s wisdom teaches but which the Set-apart Spirit teaches, comparing
spiritual matters with spiritual matters. 
1Cor
2:14  But the natural man does not
receive the matters of the Spirit of
Elohim, for they are foolishness to him, and he is unable to know them, because
they are spiritually discerned. 
1Cor
2:15  But he who is spiritual discerns
indeed all matters, but he himself is
discerned by no one. 
1Cor
2:16  For “Who has known the mind of יהוה
? Who shall instruct Him?” But we have the mind of Messiah. 
1Cor
3:1  And I, brothers, was not able to
speak to you as to spiritual ones but as to fleshly, as to babes in Messiah. 
1Cor
3:2  I fed you with milk and not with
solid food, for until now you were not able to receive it, and even now you are
still not able, 
1Cor
3:3  for you are still fleshly. For since
there is envy, and strife, and divisions among you, are you not fleshly and
walking according to man? 
1Cor
3:4  For when one says, “I am of Sha’ul,”
and another, “I am of Apollos,” are you not fleshly? 
1Cor
3:5  What then is Apollos, and what is
Sha’ul, but servants through whom you believed, as the Master assigned to each?

1Cor
3:6  I planted, Apollos watered, but
Elohim was giving growth. 
1Cor
3:7  So neither he who plants nor he who
waters is any at all, but Elohim who gives the increase. 
1Cor
3:8  And he who plants and he who waters
are one, and each one shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.

1Cor
3:9  For we are fellow workers of Elohim,
you are the field of Elohim, the building of Elohim. 
1Cor
3:10  According to the favour of Elohim
which was given to me, as a wise master builder I have laid the foundation, and
another builds on it. But each one should look how he builds on it. 
1Cor
3:11  For no one is able to lay any other
foundation except that which is laid, which is יהושע
Messiah. 
1Cor
3:12  And if anyone builds on this
foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw, 
1Cor
3:13  each one’s work shall be revealed,
for the day shall show it up, because it is revealed by fire. And the fire
shall prove the work of each one, what sort it is. 
1Cor
3:14  If anyone’s work remains, which he
has built on, he shall receive a reward. 
1Cor
3:15  If anyone’s work is burned, he
shall suffer loss, but he himself shall be saved, but so as through fire. 
1Cor
3:16  Do you not know that you are a
Dwelling Place of Elohim and that the Spirit of Elohim dwells in you? 
1Cor
3:17  If anyone destroys the Dwelling
Place of Elohim, Elohim shall destroy him. For the Dwelling Place of Elohim is
set-apart, which you are. 
1Cor
3:18  Let no one deceive himself. If
anyone among you seems to be wise in this age, let him become foolish, so that
he might become wise. 
1Cor
3:19  For the wisdom of this world is
foolishness with Elohim. For it has been written, “He catches the wise in their
craftiness,” 
1Cor
3:20  and again, “ יהוה
knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are worthless.” 
1Cor
3:21  So then, let no one boast in men,
for all belongs to you, 
1Cor
3:22  whether Sha’ul or Apollos or Kĕpha,
or the world, or life, or death, or the present or the future – all belongs to
you. 
1Cor
3:23  And you belong to Messiah, and
Messiah belongs to Elohim. 
1Cor
4:1  Let a man regard us as servants of
Messiah and trustees of the secrets of Elohim. 
1Cor
4:2  For the rest, it is sought in
trustees, that those should be found trustworthy. 
1Cor
4:3  But with me it is a small matter
that I should be judged by you or by a man’s court. But not even myself I
judge. 
1Cor
4:4  For I am not conscious of any matter against myself, yet I am not
declared right by this, but He who judges me is יהוה. 
1Cor
4:5  So do not judge any at all before
the time, until the Master comes, who shall bring to light what is hidden in
darkness and reveal the thoughts of the hearts. And then each one’s praise
shall come from Elohim. 
1Cor
4:6  And these matters, brothers, I have applied in a figure to myself and Apollos
for your sakes, so that in us you might learn not to think beyond what is
written, so that none of you be puffed up on behalf of one against the other. 
1Cor
4:7  For who makes you to differ? And
what do you have that you did not receive? And if you did indeed receive it,
why do you boast as if you had not received it? 
1Cor
4:8  You are already satisfied! You are
already enriched! You have reigned as sovereigns, apart from us! And I wish,
indeed, you did reign, that we also might reign with you! 
1Cor
4:9  For I think that Elohim has
exhibited us, the emissaries, last, as appointed to death, because we became a
spectacle to the world, both to messengers and to men. 
1Cor
4:10  We are fools for the sake of
Messiah, but you are wise in Messiah! We are weak, but you are strong! You are
in esteem, but we are not appreciated! 
1Cor
4:11  Until the present hour we both
hunger and thirst, and we are scantily clad, and beaten, and homeless, 
1Cor
4:12  and labour, working with our own
hands. Being cursed, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer; 
1Cor
4:13  being insulted, we help. We have
been made as the filth of the world – dirt wiped off by all until now. 
1Cor
4:14  I do not write this to shame you,
but to warn you as my beloved children. 
1Cor
4:15  For if you should have ten thousand
instructors in Messiah, yet not many fathers, for in Messiah יהושע
I have brought you forth through the Good News. 
1Cor
4:16  Therefore I appeal to you, to
become imitators of me. 
1Cor
4:17  For this reason I have sent Timothy
to you, who is my beloved and trustworthy son in the Master, who shall remind
you of my ways in Messiah, as I teach everywhere in every assembly. 
1Cor
4:18  Now some are puffed up, as though I
were not coming to you. 
1Cor
4:19  But I shall come to you shortly, if
the Master desires, and I shall know, not the word of those who are puffed up,
but the power. 
1Cor
4:20  For the reign of Elohim is not in
speech, but in power. 
1Cor
4:21  What do you wish? Shall I come to
you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of meekness? 
1Cor
5:1  It is commonly reported that there
is whoring among you, and such whoring as is not even named among the gentiles,
so as one to have his father’s wife! 
1Cor
5:2  And you have been puffed up, and did
not rather mourn, so that he who has done this deed, be removed from among you!

1Cor
5:3  For I indeed, as absent in body but
present in spirit, have already judged the one who did this, as though I were
present. 
1Cor
5:4  In the Name of our Master יהושע
Messiah, when you are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our
Master יהושע Messiah, 
1Cor
5:5  deliver such a one to Satan for
destruction of the flesh, in order that his spirit be saved in the day of the
Master יהושע. 
1Cor
5:6  Your boasting is not good. Do you
not know that a little leaven leavens the entire lump? 
1Cor
5:7  Therefore cleanse out the old leaven,
so that you are a new lump, as you are unleavened. For also Messiah our
Passover was offered for us. 
1Cor
5:8  So then let us observe the festival,
not with old leaven, nor with the leaven of evil and wickedness, but with the
unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. 
1Cor
5:9  I wrote to you in my letter not to
keep company with those who whore. 
1Cor
5:10  And I certainly did not mean with
those of this world who whore, or with the greedy of gain, or swindlers, or
idolaters, since then you would need to go out of the world. 
1Cor
5:11  But now I have written to you not
to keep company with anyone called ‘a brother,’ if he is one who whores, or
greedy of gain, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or a swindler –
not even to eat with such a one. 
1Cor
5:12  For what have I to do with judging
outsiders? Do you not judge those who are inside? 
1Cor
5:13  But Elohim judges those who are
outside. And put away the wicked one from among you! 
1Cor
6:1  Should any of you, holding a matter
against another, go to be judged before the unrighteous, and not before the
set-apart ones? 
1Cor
6:2  Do you not know that the set-apart
ones shall judge the world? And if the world is judged by you, are you unworthy
to judge the smallest matters? 
1Cor
6:3  Do you not know that we shall judge
messengers? How much more, matters of this life? 
1Cor
6:4  If then you truly have judgments of
this life, do you appoint them as judges who are least esteemed by the
assembly? 
1Cor
6:5  I say this to your shame. Is it so,
that there is not a wise one among you, not even one, who shall be able to
judge between his brothers? 
1Cor
6:6  But brother against brother goes to
be judged and that before unbelievers! 
1Cor
6:7  Already, then, there is a failure
with you, that you have lawsuits among you. Why not rather be wronged? Why not
rather be cheated? 
1Cor
6:8  But you yourselves do wrong and
cheat, and that to your brothers! 
1Cor
6:9  Do you not know that the unrighteous
shall not inherit the reign of Elohim? Do not be deceived. Neither those who
whore, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals, 
1Cor
6:10  nor thieves, nor greedy of gain,
nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers shall inherit the reign of Elohim.
1Cor
6:11  And such were some of you. But you
were washed, but you were set apart, but you were declared right in the Name of
the Master יהושע and by the Spirit of our Elohim.

1Cor
6:12  All is permitted me, but not all do
profit. All is permitted me, but I shall not be under authority of any. 
1Cor
6:13  Foods for the stomach and the
stomach for foods – but Elohim shall destroy both it and them. And the body is
not for whoring but for the Master, and the Master for the body. 
1Cor
6:14  And Elohim, who raised up the Master,
shall also raise us up through His power. 
1Cor
6:15  Do you not know that your bodies
are members of Messiah? Shall I then take the members of Messiah and make them
members of a whore? Let it not be! 
1Cor
6:16  Or do you not know that he who is
joined to a whore is one body? For He says, “The two shall become one flesh.” 
1Cor
6:17  And he who is joined to the Master
is one spirit. 
1Cor
6:18  Flee whoring. Every sin that a man
does is outside the body, but he who commits whoring sins against his own body.

1Cor
6:19  Or do you not know that your body
is the Dwelling Place of the Set-apart Spirit who is in you, which you have
from Elohim, and you are not your own? 
1Cor
6:20  For you were bought with a price,
therefore esteem Elohim in your body and in your spirit, which are of Elohim.
1Cor
7:1  And concerning the matters you wrote to me: It is good for
a man not to touch a woman. 
1Cor
7:2  But because of whoring, let each one
have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband. 
1Cor
7:3  Let the husband render to his wife
what is her due, and likewise also the wife to her husband. 
1Cor
7:4  The wife does not have authority
over her own body, but the husband does. And likewise the husband does not have
authority over his own body, but the wife does. 
1Cor
7:5  Do not deprive one another except
with agreement for a time, to give yourselves to fasting and prayer. And come
together again so that Satan does not try you because of your lack of
self-control. 
1Cor
7:6  And I say this as a concession, not
as a command. 
1Cor
7:7  For I wish that all men were even as
I myself. But each one has his own gift from Elohim, one in this way and
another in that. 
1Cor
7:8  And I say to the unmarried and to
the widows: It is good for them if they remain even as I am, 
1Cor
7:9  but if they do not have
self-control, let them marry, for it is better to marry than to burn. 
1Cor
7:10  And to the married I command, not
I, but the Master: A wife should not separate from a husband. 
1Cor
7:11  But if she is indeed separated, let
her remain unmarried or be restored to favour with her husband, and let a
husband not send away a wife. 
1Cor
7:12  And to the rest I say, not the
Master: If any brother has an unbelieving wife, and she thinks well to live
with him, let him not send her away. 
1Cor
7:13  And a woman who has an unbelieving
husband, and he thinks well to live with her, let her not send him away. 
1Cor
7:14  For the unbelieving husband has
been set-apart in the wife, and the unbelieving wife has been set-apart in the
husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but now they are set-apart. 
1Cor
7:15  And, if the unbelieving one
separates, let him separate himself. A brother or a sister has not been
enslaved in such matters. But Elohim has called us to peace. 
1Cor
7:16  For how do you know, O wife,
whether you shall save your husband? Or how do you know, O husband, whether you
shall save your wife? 
1Cor
7:17  Only, as Elohim has distributed to
each one, as the Master has called each one, so let him walk. And so I order in
all the assemblies. 
1Cor
7:18  Was anyone called while
circumcised? Let him not become uncircumcised. Was anyone called while
uncircumcised? Let him not be circumcised. 
1Cor
7:19  The circumcision is naught, and the
uncircumcision is naught, but the guarding of the commands of Elohim does matter!
1Cor
7:20  Let each one remain in the same
calling in which he was called. 
1Cor
7:21  Were you called while a slave? It
matters not to you, but if you are able to become free too, rather use it. 
1Cor
7:22  For he who is called in the Master
while a slave is the Master’s freed man. Likewise he who is called while free
is a slave of Messiah.
1Cor
7:23  You were bought with a price, do
not become slaves of men. 
1Cor
7:24  Brothers, let each one remain with
Elohim in that calling in which he was called. 
1Cor
7:25  And concerning maidens: I have no
command from the Master, but I give judgment as one whom the Master in His
compassion has made trustworthy. 
1Cor
7:26  I think then that this is good
because of the present necessity, that it is good for a man to remain as he is.

1Cor
7:27  Are you bound to a wife? Do not
seek to be loosed. Are you loosed from a wife? Do not seek a wife. 
1Cor
7:28  But even if you should marry, you
have not sinned. And if a maiden should marry, she has not sinned. But such
shall have pressure in the flesh, but I would spare you. 
1Cor
7:29  And this I say, brothers, the time
is short, so that from now on even those who have wives should be as though they
had none, 
1Cor
7:30  and those who weep as though they
did not weep, and those who rejoice as though they did not rejoice, and those
who buy as though they did not possess, 
1Cor
7:31  and those who use this world as not
misusing it. For the scene of this world is passing away. 
1Cor
7:32  And I wish you to be without
concern. He who is unmarried is concerned about the matters of the Master – how to please the Master. 
1Cor
7:33  But he who is married is concerned
about the matters of the world – how
to please his wife. 
1Cor
7:34  There is a difference between a
wife and a maiden. The unmarried woman is concerned about the matters of the Master, that she might be
set-apart both in body and in spirit. But she who is married is concerned about
the matters of the world – how to
please her husband. 
1Cor
7:35  And this I say for your own good,
not to put a restraint on you, but for what is proper, and to attend to the
Master without distraction. 
1Cor
7:36  And if anyone thinks he is behaving
improperly toward his maiden, if she is past the flower of her youth, and so it
should be, let him do what he desires, he does not sin – let them marry. 
1Cor
7:37  But he who stands steadfast in his
heart, having no necessity, and has authority over his own desire, and has so
decided in his heart to guard his own maiden, does well. 
1Cor
7:38  So then he who gives her in
marriage does well, but he who does not give her in marriage does better. 
1Cor
7:39  A wife is bound by Torah as long as
her husband lives, and if her husband dies, she is free to be married to whom
she desires, only in the Master. 
1Cor
7:40  But she is better off if she
remains as she is, according to my opinion. And I think I also have the Spirit
of Elohim. 
1Cor
8:1  And concerning food offered to idols: We know that we all have knowledge.
Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up. 
1Cor
8:2  If anyone thinks that he knows
somewhat, he does not yet know as he should know. 
1Cor
8:3  But if anyone loves Elohim, this one
is known by Him. 
1Cor
8:4  So then, concerning the eating of food offered to idols, we know that an
idol is no matter at all in the
world, and that there is no other Elohim but one. 
1Cor
8:5  For even if there are so-called
mighty ones, whether in heaven or on earth – as there are many mighty ones and
many masters – 
1Cor
8:6  for us there is one Elohim, the
Father, from whom all came and for whom we live,
and one Master יהושע Messiah, through whom all
came and through whom we live.
1Cor
8:7  However, not all have this
knowledge. But some, being aware of the idol, until now eat it as having been
offered to an idol, so their conscience, being weak, is defiled. 
1Cor
8:8  But food does not commend us to
Elohim, for we are none the better if we eat, nor any worse for not eating. 
1Cor
8:9  But look to it, lest somehow this
right of yours become a stumbling-block to those who are weak. 
1Cor
8:10  For if anyone sees you who have
knowledge eating in an idol’s place, shall not his conscience, if he is weak,
be built up to eat food offered to idols?

1Cor
8:11  So this weak brother, for whom
Messiah died, shall perish through your knowledge! 
1Cor
8:12  Now sinning in this way against the
brothers, and wounding their weak conscience, you sin against Messiah. 
1Cor
8:13  Therefore, if food makes my brother
stumble, I am never again going to eat meat, lest I make my brother stumble. 
1Cor
9:1  Am I not an emissary? Am I not free?
Have I not seen יהושע Messiah our Master? Are you
not my work in the Master? 
1Cor
9:2  If to others I am not an emissary, I
certainly am to you. For you are the seal of my office of the emissary in the
Master. 
1Cor
9:3  My defence to those who examine me
is this: 
1Cor
9:4  Do we not have a right to eat and
drink? 
1Cor
9:5  Do we not have a right to take along
a sister – a wife – as do also the other emissaries, and the brothers of the
Master, and Kĕpha? 
1Cor
9:6  Or do only Barnaḇah and I have
no right to refrain from working? 
1Cor
9:7  Who serves as a soldier at his own
expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat of its fruit? Or who shepherds
a flock and does not feed on the milk of the flock? 
1Cor
9:8  Do I say this as a man? Or does not
the Torah say the same too? 
1Cor
9:9  For it has been written in the Torah
of Mosheh, “You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the grain.” Is it
about oxen Elohim is concerned? 
1Cor
9:10  Or does He say it because of us
all? For this was written because of us, that he who ploughs should plough in
expectation, and the thresher in expectation of sharing. 
1Cor
9:11  If we have sown spiritual seed among you, is it too much if we
reap material goods from you? 
1Cor
9:12  If others share authority over you,
should not rather we? But we have not used this authority, but we put up with
all, lest we hinder the Good News of Messiah. 
1Cor
9:13  Do you not know that those serving
the Set-apart Place eat from the Set-apart Place, and those attending at the
altar have their share of the offerings of the altar? 
1Cor
9:14  So also the Master instituted that
those announcing the Good News should live from the Good News. 
1Cor
9:15  But I have used none of these, nor
have I written this that it should be done so to me. For it would be better for
me to die than that anyone should make my boasting empty. 
1Cor
9:16  For if I bring the Good News, it is
no boasting for me, for necessity is laid on me, and it is woe to me if I do
not bring the Good News! 
1Cor
9:17  For if I do this voluntarily I have
a reward, but if not voluntarily, I am entrusted with a management. 
1Cor
9:18  What then is my reward? That in
bringing the Good News, I should offer the Good News of Messiah without cost,
so as not to abuse my authority in the Good News. 
1Cor
9:19  For though I am free from all, I
made myself a servant to all, in order to win more, 
1Cor
9:20  and to the Yehuḏim I became
as a Yehuḏite, that I might win Yehuḏim; to those who are under
Torah, as under Torah, so as to win those who are under Torah; 
1Cor
9:21  to those without Torah, as without
Torah – not being without Torah toward Elohim, but under Torah of Messiah – so
as to win those who are without Torah. 
1Cor
9:22  To the weak I became as weak, so as
to win the weak. To all men I have
become all, so as to save some, by all means. 
1Cor
9:23  And I do this because of the Good
News, so as to become a fellow-partaker with it. 
1Cor
9:24  Do you not know that those who run
in a race indeed all run, but one receives the prize? Run in such a way as to
obtain it. 
1Cor
9:25  And everyone who competes controls
himself in every way. Now they do it to receive a corruptible crown, but we for
an incorruptible crown. 
1Cor
9:26  Therefore I run accordingly, not
with uncertainty. Thus I fight, not as one who beats the air. 
1Cor
9:27  But I treat my body severely and
make it my slave, so that when I have proclaimed to others, I myself might be
rejected. 
1Cor
10:1  For I do not wish you to be
ignorant, brothers, that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed
through the sea, 
1Cor
10:2  and all were immersed into Mosheh
in the cloud and in the sea, 
1Cor
10:3  and all ate the same spiritual
food, 
1Cor
10:4  and all drank the same spiritual
drink. For they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed, and the Rock was
Messiah. 
1Cor
10:5  However, with most of them Elohim
was not well pleased, for they were laid low in the wilderness. 
1Cor
10:6  And these became examples for us,
so that we should not lust after evil, as those indeed lusted. 
1Cor
10:7  And do not become idolaters as some
of them, as it has been written, “The people sat down to eat and to drink, and
stood up to play.” 
1Cor
10:8  Neither should we commit whoring,
as some of them did, and in one day twenty-three thousand fell, 
1Cor
10:9  neither let us try Messiah, as some
of them also tried, and were destroyed by serpents, 
1Cor
10:10  neither grumble, as some of them
also grumbled, and were destroyed by the destroyer. 
1Cor
10:11  And all these came upon them as
examples, and they were written as a warning to us, on whom the ends of the
ages have come, 
1Cor
10:12  so that he who thinks he stands,
let him take heed lest he fall. 
1Cor
10:13  No trial has overtaken you except
such as is common to man, and Elohim is trustworthy, who shall not allow you to
be tried beyond what you are able, but with the trial shall also make the way
of escape, enabling you to bear it. 
1Cor
10:14  Therefore, my beloved ones, flee
from idolatry. 
1Cor
10:15  I speak as to wise men, judge for
yourselves what I say. 
1Cor
10:16  The cup of blessing which we
bless, is it not a sharing in the blood of Messiah? The bread that we break, is
it not a sharing in the body of Messiah? 
1Cor
10:17  Because there is one bread, we,
who are many, are one body, for we all partake of the one bread. 
1Cor
10:18  Look at Yisra’ĕl after the
flesh: Are not those who eat of the offerings sharers in the altar? 
1Cor
10:19  What then do I say? That an idol
is of any value? Or that which is
offered to idols is of any value? 
1Cor
10:20  No, but what the gentiles offer
they offer to demons and not to Elohim, and I do not wish you to become sharers
with demons.
1Cor
10:21  You are not able to drink the cup
of the Master and the cup of demons, you are not able to partake of the table
of the Master and of the table of demons. 
1Cor
10:22  Do we provoke the Master to
jealousy? Are we stronger than He? 
1Cor
10:23  All is permitted me, but not all
do profit. All is permitted me, but not all build up. 
1Cor
10:24  Let no one seek his own, but each
one that of the other. 
1Cor
10:25  You eat whatever is sold in the
meat market, asking no questions because of conscience, 
1Cor
10:26  for “The earth belongs to יהוה,
and all that fills it.” 
1Cor
10:27  And if any of the unbelievers
invite you, and you wish to go, you eat whatever is set before you, asking no
question on account of the conscience. 
1Cor
10:28  And if anyone says to you, “This
was offered to idols,” do not eat it because of the one pointing it out to you,
and on account of the conscience, for “The earth belongs to יהוה,
and all that fills it.” 
1Cor
10:29  Now I say conscience, not your
own, but that of the other. For why is my freedom judged by another’s
conscience? 
1Cor
10:30  But if I partake with thanks, why
am I evil spoken of for what I give thanks? 
1Cor
10:31  Therefore, whether you eat or
drink, or whatever you do, do all to the esteem of Elohim. 
1Cor
10:32  Cause no stumbling, either to the
Yehuḏim or to the Greeks or to the assembly of Elohim, 
1Cor
10:33  as I also please all men in all matters, not seeking my own advantage, but that of the many, that
they might be saved. 
1Cor
11:1  Become imitators of me, as I also
am of Messiah. 
1Cor
11:2  And I praise you, brothers, that
you remember me in every way and keep the traditions as I delivered them to
you. 
1Cor
11:3  And I wish you to know that the
head of every man is the Messiah, and the head of woman is the man, and the
head of Messiah is Elohim. 
1Cor
11:4  Every man praying or prophesying,
having his head covered, brings shame to his Head. 
1Cor
11:5  And every woman praying or
prophesying with her head uncovered brings shame to her head, for that is one
and the same as if her head were shaved. 
1Cor
11:6  For if a woman is not covered, let
her also be shorn. But if it is a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaved, let
her be covered. 
1Cor
11:7  For a man indeed should not cover
his head, since he is the likeness and esteem of Elohim, but woman is the
esteem of man. 
1Cor
11:8  For man is not from woman, but
woman from man. 
1Cor
11:9  For man also was not created for
the woman, but woman for the man. 
1Cor
11:10  Because of this the woman ought to
have a symbol of authority on her head, because of the messengers. 
1Cor
11:11  However, man is not independent of
woman, nor woman independent of man, in the Master. 
1Cor
11:12  For as the woman was from the man,
even so the man also is through the woman. But all are from Elohim. 
1Cor
11:13  Judge for yourselves: is it proper
for a woman to pray to Elohim with her head uncovered? 
1Cor
11:14  Does not nature itself teach you
that if a man indeed has long hair, it is a disrespect to him? 
1Cor
11:15  And if a woman has long hair, it
is an esteem to her, because the long hair has been given to her over against a
veil. 
1Cor
11:16  If, however, anyone seems to be
contentious, we do not have such a habit, nor do the assemblies of Elohim. 
1Cor
11:17  And in declaring this I do not
praise you, since you come together not for the better but for the worse. 
1Cor
11:18  For in the first place, I hear
that when you come together as an assembly, there are divisions among you, and
to some extent I believe it. 
1Cor
11:19  For there have to be factions even
among you, so that the approved ones might be revealed among you. 
1Cor
11:20  So when you come together in one
place, it is not to eat the Master’s supper. 
1Cor
11:21  For, when you eat, each one takes
his own supper first, and one is hungry and another is drunk. 
1Cor
11:22  Have you not houses to eat and
drink in? Or do you despise the assembly of Elohim and shame those who have
not? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you in this? I do not praise! 
1Cor
11:23  For I received from the Master
that which I also delivered to you: that the Master יהושע
in the night in which He was delivered up took bread, 
1Cor
11:24  and having given thanks, He broke
it and said, “Take, eat, this is My body which is broken for you; do this in
remembrance of Me.” 
1Cor
11:25  In the same way also the cup,
after supper, saying, “This cup is the renewed covenant in My blood. As often
as you drink it, do this in remembrance of Me.” 
1Cor
11:26  For as often as you eat this bread
and drink this cup, you proclaim the death of the Master until He comes. 
1Cor
11:27  So that whoever should eat this
bread or drink this cup of the Master unworthily shall be guilty of the body
and blood of the Master. 
1Cor
11:28  But let a man examine himself, and
so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup. 
1Cor
11:29  For the one who is eating and
drinking unworthily, eats and drinks judgment to himself, not discerning the
body of the Master. 
1Cor
11:30  Because of this many are weak and
sick among you, and many sleep. 
1Cor
11:31  For if we were to examine
ourselves, we would not be judged. 
1Cor
11:32  But when we are judged, we are
disciplined by the Master, that we should not be condemned with the world. 
1Cor
11:33  So then, my brothers, when you
come together to eat, wait for one another. 
1Cor
11:34  And if anyone is hungry, let him
eat at home, lest you come together for judgment. And the rest I shall set in
order when I come. 
1Cor
12:1  And concerning spiritual gifts,
brothers, I do not wish you to be ignorant. 
1Cor
12:2  You know that you were gentiles,
led away to the dumb idols, even as you might be led.
1Cor
12:3  Therefore I make known to you that
no one speaking by the Spirit of Elohim says יהושע
is a curse, and no one is able to say that יהושע
is Master except by the Set-apart Spirit. 
1Cor
12:4  And there are different kinds of
gifts, but the same Spirit. 
1Cor
12:5  There are different kinds of
services, but the same Master. 
1Cor
12:6  And there are different kinds of
workings, but it is the same Elohim who is working all in all. 
1Cor
12:7  And to each one is given the
manifestation of the Spirit for profiting, 
1Cor
12:8  for to one is given a word of
wisdom through the Spirit, and to another a word of knowledge according to the
same Spirit, 
1Cor
12:9  and to another belief by the same
Spirit, and to another gifts of healing by the same Spirit, 
1Cor
12:10  and to another operations of
powers, and to another prophecy, and to another discerning of spirits, and to
another kinds of tongues, and to another interpretation of tongues. 
1Cor
12:11  But one and the same Spirit works
all these, distributing to each one individually as He intends. 
1Cor
12:12  For as the body is one and has
many members, but all the members of that one body, being many, are one body,
so also is the Messiah. 
1Cor
12:13  For indeed by one Spirit we were
all immersed into one body, whether Yehuḏim or Greeks, whether slaves or
free, and we were all made to drink into one Spirit. 
1Cor
12:14  For indeed the body is not one
member but many. 
1Cor
12:15  If the foot says, “Because I am
not a hand, I do not belong to the body,” does it therefore not belong to the
body? 
1Cor
12:16  And if the ear says, “Because I am
not an eye, I do not belong to the body,” does it therefore not belong to the
body? 
1Cor
12:17  If all the body was an eye, where
would be the hearing? If all hearing, where would be the smelling? 
1Cor
12:18  But now Elohim has set the
members, each one of them, in the body, even as He pleased. 
1Cor
12:19  And if they all had been one
member, where would the body be? 
1Cor
12:20  And now, there are indeed many
members, but one body. 
1Cor
12:21  And an eye is unable to say to the
hand, “I have no need of you,” or again the head to the feet, “I have no need
of you.” 
1Cor
12:22  But much rather, those members of
the body which are thought to be weaker are necessary. 
1Cor
12:23  And to those of the body which we
think to be less respected, these we present greater respect. And our unseemly members have greater seemliness, 
1Cor
12:24  whereas our seemly members have no need. But Elohim blended
together the body, having given greater respect to that member which lacks it, 
1Cor
12:25  that there should be no division
in the body, but that the members should have the same concern one for another.

1Cor
12:26  And if one member suffers, all the
members suffer with it; or if one member is esteemed, all the members rejoice
with it. 
1Cor
12:27  And you are a body of Messiah, and
members individually. 
1Cor
12:28  And Elohim has appointed these in
the assembly: firstly emissaries, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers, after
that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, ministrations, kinds of tongues. 
1Cor
12:29  Are all emissaries? Are all
prophets? Are all teachers? Are all workers of miracles? 
1Cor
12:30  Do all have gifts of healings? Do
all speak with tongues? Do all interpret? 
1Cor
12:31  But earnestly seek the better
gifts. And yet I show you a more excellent way. 
1Cor
13:1  If I speak with the tongues of men
and of messengers, but do not have love, I have become as sounding brass or a
clanging cymbal. 
1Cor
13:2  And if I have prophecy, and know
all secrets and all knowledge, and if I have all belief, so as to remove
mountains, but do not have love, I am none at all. 
1Cor
13:3  And if I give out all my
possessions to feed the poor, and if I give my body to be burned, but do not
have love, I am not profited at all. 
1Cor
13:4  Love is patient, is kind, love does
not envy, love does not boast, is not puffed up, 
1Cor
13:5  does not behave indecently, does
not seek its own, is not provoked, reckons not the evil, 
1Cor
13:6  does not rejoice over the
unrighteousness, but rejoices in the truth, 
1Cor
13:7  it covers all, believes all,
expects all, endures all. 
1Cor
13:8  Love never fails. And whether there be prophecies, they shall be
inactive; or tongues, they shall cease; or knowledge, it shall be inactive. 
1Cor
13:9  For we know in part and we prophesy
in part. 
1Cor
13:10  But when that which is perfect has
come, then that which is in part shall be inactive. 
1Cor
13:11  When I was a child, I spoke as a
child, I thought as a child, I reasoned as a child. But when I became a man, I
did away with childish matters. 
1Cor
13:12  For now we see in a mirror, dimly,
but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know, as I also
have been known. 
1Cor
13:13  And now belief, expectation, and
love remain – these three. But the greatest of these is love. 
1Cor
14:1  Pursue love, and earnestly seek the
spiritual gifts, but rather that you prophesy. 
1Cor
14:2  For he who is speaking in a tongue
does not speak to men but to Elohim, for no one understands, but in the Spirit
he speaks secrets. 
1Cor
14:3  But he who is prophesying speaks
upbuilding and encouragement and comfort to men. 
1Cor
14:4  He who is speaking in a tongue
builds up himself, but he who is prophesying builds up the assembly. 
1Cor
14:5  Now I wish you all spoke with
tongues, but rather that you might prophesy, for he who is prophesying is
greater than he who is speaking with tongues, unless he interprets, so that the
assembly might receive upbuilding. 
1Cor
14:6  But now, brothers, if I come to you
speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you unless I speak to you, either by
revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by teaching? 
1Cor
14:7  Nevertheless, lifeless instruments making a sound, whether
flute or harp, if they do not make a distinction in the sound, how shall it be
known what is played on the flute or on the harp? 
1Cor
14:8  For indeed, if the trumpet makes an
indistinct sound, who shall prepare himself for battle? 
1Cor
14:9  So also you, if you do not give
speech by the tongue that is clear, how shall it be known what is spoken? For
you shall be speaking into the air. 
1Cor
14:10  There are, undoubtedly, so many
kinds of sounds in the world, and none of them is without distinct sound. 
1Cor
14:11  If then I do not know the power of
the voice, I shall be a foreigner to him who speaks, and he who speaks be a
foreigner to me. 
1Cor
14:12  So also you, since you are ardent
for spiritual gifts, seek to excel in the upbuilding of the assembly. 
1Cor
14:13  Therefore, he who is speaking in a
tongue, let him pray that he might interpret. 
1Cor
14:14  For if I am praying in a tongue,
my spirit is praying, but my understanding is without fruit. 
1Cor
14:15  What then is it? I shall pray with
the spirit, and I shall also pray with the understanding. I shall sing with the
spirit, and I shall also sing with the understanding. 
1Cor
14:16  Otherwise, if you bless with the
spirit, how shall he who fills up the place of the unlearned say “Amĕn” at
your giving of thanks, since he does not know what you say? 
1Cor
14:17  For you truly give thanks well,
but the other is not built up. 
1Cor
14:18  I thank my Elohim I speak with
tongues more than you all, 
1Cor
14:19  but in an assembly I wish to speak
five words with my understanding that I might instruct others also, than ten
thousand words in a tongue. 
1Cor
14:20  Brothers, do not be children in your thinking, but in evil be babes, and
in your thinking be perfect. 
1Cor
14:21  In the Torah it has been written, “With
men of other tongues and other lips I shall speak to this people. And even so,
they shall not hear Me, says יהוה.” 
1Cor
14:22  So then tongues are for a sign,
not to those who believe but to unbelievers, and prophesying is not for
unbelievers but for those who believe. 
1Cor
14:23  If then all the assembly comes
together in one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in those who
are unlearned or unbelievers, shall they not say that you are mad? 
1Cor
14:24  But if all prophesy, and an
unbeliever or an unlearned one comes in, he is reproved by all, he is discerned
by all. 
1Cor
14:25  And so the secrets of his heart
are revealed. And so, falling down on his face, he shall worship Elohim,
declaring that Elohim is truly among you. 
1Cor
14:26  What then is it, brothers?
Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a tongue,
has a revelation, has an interpretation. Let all be done for upbuilding. 
1Cor
14:27  If anyone speaks in a tongue, let
there be two or at the most three, each in turn, and let one interpret. 
1Cor
14:28  And if there is no interpreter,
let him be silent in an assembly, and let him speak to himself and to Elohim. 
1Cor
14:29  And let two or three prophets
speak, and let the others discern. 
1Cor
14:30  And if there should be a
revelation to another who sits by, let the first be silent. 
1Cor
14:31  For you are all able to prophesy
one by one, so that all learn and all be encouraged. 
1Cor
14:32  And the spirits of the prophets
are subject to the prophets. 
1Cor
14:33  For Elohim is not Elohim of disorder but of peace, as in
all the assemblies of the set-apart ones. 
1Cor
14:34  Let your women be silent in the
assemblies, for they are not allowed to speak, but let them subject themselves,
as the Torah also says. 
1Cor
14:35  And if they wish to learn
whatever, let them ask their own husbands at home, for it is improper for women
to speak in an assembly. 
1Cor
14:36  Or did the word of Elohim go out
from you? Or did it reach only to you? 
1Cor
14:37  If anyone thinks himself to be a
prophet or spiritual, let him acknowledge what I write to you, that they are a
command of the Master. 
1Cor
14:38  And if anyone is ignorant, let him
be ignorant. 
1Cor
14:39  So, then, brothers, earnestly seek
to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues. 
1Cor
14:40  Let all be done decently and in
order. 
1Cor
15:1  But brothers, I make known to you
the Good News, which I brought as Good News to you, which you also did receive,
and in which you stand, 
1Cor
15:2  through which also you are being
saved, if you hold fast that word I brought as Good News to you. Otherwise, you
have believed in vain. 
1Cor
15:3  For I delivered to you at the first
that which I also received: that Messiah died for our sins according to the
Scriptures, 
1Cor
15:4  and that He was buried, and that He
was raised the third day, according to the Scriptures, 
1Cor
15:5  and that He was seen by Kĕpha,
then by the twelve. 
1Cor
15:6  After that He was seen by over five
hundred brothers at one time, of whom the greater part remain till now, but
some have fallen asleep. 
1Cor
15:7  After that He was seen by Ya‛aqoḇ,
then by all the emissaries. 
1Cor
15:8  And last of all He was seen by me
also, as if to one born prematurely. 
1Cor
15:9  For I am the least of the
emissaries, who am not worthy to be called an emissary, because I persecuted
the assembly of Elohim. 
1Cor
15:10  But by the favour of Elohim I am
what I am, and His favour toward me was not in vain, but I laboured much more
than they all, yet not I, but the favour of Elohim with me. 
1Cor
15:11  Whether, then, it was I or they,
so we proclaimed and so you believed. 
1Cor
15:12  And if Messiah is proclaimed that
He has been raised from the dead, how do some among you say that there is no
resurrection of the dead? 
1Cor
15:13  And if there is no resurrection of
the dead, then Messiah has not been raised. 
1Cor
15:14  And if Messiah has not been
raised, then our proclaiming is empty, and your belief also empty, 
1Cor
15:15  and we are also found false
witnesses of Elohim, because we have witnessed of Elohim that He raised up
Messiah, whom He did not raise up, if then the dead are not raised. 
1Cor
15:16  For if the dead are not raised,
then neither Messiah has been raised. 
1Cor
15:17  And if Messiah has not been
raised, your belief is to no purpose, you are still in your sins! 
1Cor
15:18  Then also those who have fallen
asleep in Messiah have perished. 
1Cor
15:19  If in this life only we have
expectation in Messiah, we are of all men the most wretched. 
1Cor
15:20  But now Messiah has been raised
from the dead, and has become the first-fruit of those having fallen asleep. 
1Cor
15:21  For since death is through a man,
resurrection of the dead is also through a Man. 
1Cor
15:22  For as all die in Aḏam, so
also all shall be made alive in Messiah . 
1Cor
15:23  And each in his own order: Messiah
the first-fruits, then those who are of Messiah at His coming, 
1Cor
15:24  then the end, when He delivers up
the reign to Elohim the Father, when He has brought to naught all rule and all
authority and power. 
1Cor
15:25  For He has to reign until He has
put all enemies under His feet. 
1Cor
15:26  The last enemy to be brought to
naught is death. 
1Cor
15:27  For “He has put all under His
feet.” But when He says “all are put under Him,” it is clear that He who put
all under Him is excepted. 
1Cor
15:28  And when all are made subject to
Him, then the Son Himself shall also be subject to Him who put all under Him,
in order that Elohim be all in all. 
1Cor
15:29  Otherwise, what shall they do who
are immersed for the dead, if the dead are not raised at all? Why indeed are
they immersed for the dead? 
1Cor
15:30  And why do we stand in danger
every hour? 
1Cor
15:31  I affirm, by the boasting in you which
I have in Messiah יהושע our Master, I die day by
day. 
1Cor
15:32  If, as men do, I have fought with
beasts at Ephesos, of what good is it to me? If the dead are not raised, “Let
us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.” 
1Cor
15:33  Do not be led astray, “Evil
company corrupts good habits.” 
1Cor
15:34  Wake up to soberness, righteously,
and do not sin, for some do not have the knowledge of Elohim. I speak this to
your shame. 
1Cor
15:35  But someone might say, “How are
the dead raised up? And with what body do they come?” 
1Cor
15:36  Senseless one! What you sow is not
made alive unless it dies. 
1Cor
15:37  And as to what you sow: you do not
sow the body which is to be, but a bare grain, it might be wheat or some other
grain. 
1Cor
15:38  But Elohim gives it a body as He
wishes, and to each seed a body of its own. 
1Cor
15:39  All flesh is not the same flesh,
but there is one flesh of men, and another flesh of beasts, and another of
fishes, and another of birds. 
1Cor
15:40  And there are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies, but the esteem of the
heavenly is truly one, and the esteem of the earthly is another, 
1Cor
15:41  one esteem of the sun, and another
esteem of the moon, and another esteem of the stars – for star differs from
star in esteem. 
1Cor
15:42  So also is the resurrection of the
dead: it is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption; 
1Cor
15:43  it is sown in disrespect, it is
raised in esteem; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power; 
1Cor
15:44  it is sown a natural body, it is
raised a spiritual body; there is a natural body, and there is a spiritual
body. 
1Cor
15:45  And so it has been written, “The
first man Aḏam became a living being,” the last Aḏam a life-giving
Spirit. 
1Cor
15:46  The spiritual, however, was not
first, but the natural, and afterward the spiritual. 
1Cor
15:47  The first man was of the earth,
earthy; the second Man is the Master from heaven. 
1Cor
15:48  As is the earthy, so also are
those who are earthy; and as is the heavenly, so also are those who are
heavenly. 
1Cor
15:49  And as we have borne the likeness
of the earthy, we shall also bear the likeness of the heavenly. 
1Cor
15:50  And this I say, brothers, that
flesh and blood is unable to inherit the reign of Elohim, neither does
corruption inherit incorruption. 
1Cor
15:51  See, I speak a secret to you: We
shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, 
1Cor
15:52  in a moment, in the twinkling of
an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be
raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. 
1Cor
15:53  For this corruptible has to put on
incorruption, and this mortal to put on immortality. 
1Cor
15:54  And when this corruptible has put
on incorruption, and this mortal has put on immortality, then shall come to be
the word that has been written, “Death is swallowed up in overcoming.” 
1Cor
15:55  “O Death, where is your sting? O
grave, where is your overcoming?” 
1Cor
15:56  And the sting of death is the sin,
and the power of the sin is the Torah. 
1Cor
15:57  But thanks to Elohim who gives us
the overcoming through our Master יהושע Messiah. 
1Cor
15:58  Therefore, my beloved brothers, be
steadfast, immovable, always excelling in the work of the Master, knowing that
your labour is not in vain in the Master. 
1Cor
16:1  And concerning the collections for
the set-apart ones, you are to do as I gave orders to the assemblies of
Galatia: 
1Cor
16:2  On the first day of the week let
each one of you set aside, storing up whatever he is prospered, so that there
are no collections when I come. 
1Cor
16:3  And when I come, whomever you
approve by your letters, I shall send to bear your gift to Yerushalayim. 
1Cor
16:4  And if it is fitting for me to go,
they shall go with me. 
1Cor
16:5  And I shall come to you when I pass
through Makedonia, for I am passing through Makedonia. 
1Cor
16:6  And possibly I shall stay with you,
or even spend the winter, so that you send me forward, wherever I go. 
1Cor
16:7  For I do not wish to see you now on
the way, but I expect to stay a while with you, if the Master permits. 
1Cor
16:8  And I shall remain in Ephesos until
the Festival of Weeks. 
1Cor
16:9  For a great and effective door has
opened to me, and many are opposing. 
1Cor
16:10  And if Timothy comes, see that he
is with you without fear, for he does the work of the Master, even as I. 
1Cor
16:11  Therefore let no one despise him.
And send him forward in peace, so that he comes to me, for I am waiting for him
with the brothers. 
1Cor
16:12  And concerning our brother
Apollos, I strongly urged him to come to you with the brothers, but he had no
desire at all to come at this time; however, he shall come when it is
convenient. 
1Cor
16:13  Watch, stand fast in the belief,
be men, be strong. 
1Cor
16:14  Let all that you do be done in
love. 
1Cor
16:15  And I urge you, brothers, you know
the household of Stephanas, that it is the first-fruit of Achaia, and that they
have assigned themselves for service to the set-apart ones, 
1Cor
16:16  that you also be subject to such,
and to everyone who works and labours with us. 
1Cor
16:17  And I rejoice about the coming of
Stephanas, and Fortunatos, and Achaikos, for what was lacking on your part they
supplied. 
1Cor
16:18  For they refreshed my spirit and
yours, therefore give recognition to such ones. 
1Cor
16:19  The assemblies of Asia greet you.
Aqulas and Priscilla greet you heartily in the Master, with the assembly that
is in their house. 
1Cor
16:20  All the brothers greet you. Greet
one another with a set-apart kiss. 
1Cor
16:21  The greeting with my own hand –
Sha’ul. 
1Cor
16:22  If anyone does not love the Master
יהושע Messiah, let him be a curse. Maranatha! 
1Cor
16:23  The favour of our Master יהושע
Messiah be with you. 
1Cor
16:24  My love be with you all in Messiah
יהושע. Amĕn.
