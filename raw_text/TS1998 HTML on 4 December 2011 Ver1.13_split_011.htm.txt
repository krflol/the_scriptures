Deut
17:8  “When any matter arises which is
too hard for you to judge, between blood and blood, between plea and plea, or
between stroke and stroke – matters of strife within your gates – then you
shall rise and go up to the place which יהוה your
Elohim chooses, 
Deut
17:9  and shall come to the priests, the
Lĕwites, and to the judge who is in those days, and shall inquire. And
they shall declare to you the word of right-ruling, 
Deut
17:10  and you shall do according to the
word which they declare to you from that place which יהוה
chooses. And you shall guard to do according to all that they instruct you. 
Deut
17:11  “Do according to the Torah in
which they teach you, according to the right-ruling which they say to you. You
do not turn to the right or to the left from the word which they declare to
you. 
Deut
17:12  “And the man who acts arrogantly,
so as not to listen to the priest who stands to serve there before יהוה
your Elohim, or to the judge, that man shall die. So you shall purge the evil
from Yisra’ĕl. 
Deut
17:13  “And let all the people hear and
fear, and no longer do arrogantly. 
Deut
17:14  “When you come to the land which יהוה
your Elohim is giving you, and shall possess it and shall dwell in it, and you
shall say, ‘Let me set a sovereign over me like all the gentiles that are
around me,’ 
Deut
17:15  you shall certainly set a
sovereign over you whom יהוה your Elohim shall choose.
Set a sovereign over you from among your brothers, you are not allowed to set a
foreigner over you, who is not your brother. 
Deut
17:16  “Only, he is not to increase
horses for himself, nor cause the people to return to Mitsrayim to increase
horses, for יהוה has said to you, ‘Do not return that
way again.’ 
Deut
17:17  “And he is not to increase wives
for himself, lest his heart turn away, nor is he to greatly increase silver and
gold for himself. 
Deut
17:18  “And it shall be, when he sits on
the throne of his reign, that he shall write for himself a copy of this Torah
in a book, from the one before the priests, the Lĕwites. 
Deut
17:19  “And it shall be with him, and he
shall read it all the days of his life, so that he learns to fear יהוה
his Elohim and guard all the Words of this Torah and these laws, to do them, 
Deut
17:20  so that his heart is not lifted up
above his brothers, and so as not to turn aside from the command, right or
left, so that he prolongs his days in his reign, he and his children, in the
midst of Yisra’ĕl. 
Deut
18:1  “The priests, the Lĕwites, all
the tribe of Lĕwi, have no part nor inheritance with Yisra’ĕl. They
are to eat the offerings of יהוה made by fire, and His
inheritance. 
Deut
18:2  “But among his brothers Lĕwi has no inheritance. יהוה
is his inheritance, as He has spoken to him. 
Deut
18:3  “And this is the priest’s right
from the people, from those who bring an offering, whether it is bull or sheep:
they shall give to the priest the shoulder, and the two cheeks, and the
stomach; 
Deut
18:4  the first-fruits of your grain and
your new wine and your oil, and the first of the fleece of your sheep, you give
to him. 
Deut
18:5  “For יהוה
your Elohim has chosen him out of all your tribes to stand to serve in the Name
of יהוה, him and his sons forever. 
Deut
18:6  “And when the Lĕwite comes
from one of your gates, from where he has sojourned among all Yisra’ĕl,
and shall come with all the desire of his being to the place which יהוה
chooses, 
Deut
18:7  then he shall serve in the Name of יהוה
his Elohim, like all his brothers the Lĕwites, who are standing there
before יהוה. 
Deut
18:8  “They are to have portion for
portion to eat, besides what comes from the sale of his inheritance. 
Deut
18:9  “When you come into the land which יהוה
your Elohim is giving you, do not learn to do according to the abominations of
those gentiles. 
Deut
18:10  “Let no one be found among you who
makes his son or his daughter pass through the fire, or one who practises
divination, or a user of magic, or one who interprets omens or a sorcerer, 
Deut
18:11  or one who conjures spells, or a
medium, or a spiritist, or one who calls up the dead. 
Deut
18:12  “For whoever does these are an
abomination to יהוה, and because of these abominations יהוה
your Elohim drives them out from before you. 
Deut
18:13  “Be perfect before יהוה
your Elohim, 
Deut
18:14  for these nations whom you are
possessing do listen to those using magic and to diviners. But as for you, יהוה
your Elohim has not appointed such for you. 
Deut
18:15  “ יהוה
your Elohim shall raise up for you a Prophet like me from your midst, from your
brothers. Listen to Him, 
Deut
18:16  according to all you asked of יהוה
your Elohim in Ḥorĕḇ in the day of the assembly, saying, ‘Let
me not hear again the voice of יהוה my Elohim, nor let
me see this great fire any more, lest I die.’ 
Deut
18:17  “And יהוה
said to me, ‘What they have spoken is good. 
Deut
18:18  ‘I shall raise up for them a
Prophet like you out of the midst of their brothers. And I shall put My Words
in His mouth, and He shall speak to them all that I command Him. 
Deut
18:19  ‘And it shall be, the man who does
not listen to My Words which He speaks in My Name, I require it of him. 
Deut
18:20  ‘But the prophet who presumes to
speak a word in My Name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or who speaks
in the name of other mighty ones, even that prophet shall die.’ 
Deut
18:21  “And when you say in your heart, ‘How
do we know the word which יהוה has not spoken?’ – 
Deut
18:22  when the prophet speaks in the
Name of יהוה and the word is not, or comes not, that is
the word which יהוה has not spoken. The prophet has
spoken it presumptuously. Do not be afraid of him. 
Deut
19:1  “When יהוה
your Elohim cuts off the nations whose land יהוה your
Elohim is giving you, and you dispossess them and dwell in their cities and in
their houses, 
Deut
19:2  separate three cities for yourself
in the midst of your land which יהוה your Elohim is
giving you to possess. 
Deut
19:3  “Prepare a way for yourself, and
divide into three parts the border of your land which יהוה
your Elohim is giving you to inherit, that anyone who killed someone shall flee
there. 
Deut
19:4  “And this is the matter of the one
who killed someone who flees there and live: He who smites his neighbour
unintentionally, not having hated him in time past, 
Deut
19:5  even he who goes to the forest with
his neighbour to cut timber, and his hand swings a stroke with the axe to cut
down the tree, and the head slips from the handle and strikes his neighbour so
that he dies – let him flee to one of these cities and live, 
Deut
19:6  lest the revenger of blood, while
his displeasure is hot, pursue the one who killed someone and overtake him,
because the way is long, and shall smite him, though he was not worthy of
death, since he had not hated him before. 
Deut
19:7  “Therefore I am commanding you,
saying, ‘Separate three cities for yourself.’ 
Deut
19:8  “And if יהוה
your Elohim enlarges your border, as He swore to your fathers, and has given
you the land which He promised to give to your fathers – 
Deut
19:9  when you guard all this command to
do it, which I am commanding you today, to love יהוה
your Elohim and to walk in His ways all the days – then you shall add three
more cities for yourself besides these three, 
Deut
19:10  so that innocent blood is not shed
in the midst of your land which יהוה your Elohim is
giving you as an inheritance, or blood-guilt shall be upon you. 
Deut
19:11  “But when anyone hates his
neighbour, and shall lie in wait for him and rise against him and smite the
life from him so that he dies, then he shall flee to one of these cities, 
Deut
19:12  and the elders of his city shall
send and bring him from there, and give him into the hand of the revenger of
blood, and he shall die. 
Deut
19:13  “Your eye shall not pardon him,

might be well with you.

boundary, which those in the past have set, in your inheritance which you
inherit in the land that יהוה your Elohim is giving you
to possess. 
Deut
19:15  “One witness does not rise up
against a man concerning any crookedness or any sin that he commits. At the
mouth of two witnesses or at the mouth of three witnesses a matter is
established. 
Deut
19:16  “When a malicious witness rises up
against any man to accuse him of turning aside, 
Deut
19:17  then both men who have the dispute
shall stand before יהוה, before the priests and the
judges who serve in those days. 
Deut
19:18  “And the judges shall diligently
search and see if the witness is a false witness, who has falsely accused his
brother, 
Deut
19:19  then you shall do to him as he
thought to have done to his brother. Thus you shall purge the evil from your
midst. 
Deut

Deut
20:1  “When you go out to battle against
your enemies, and shall see horses and chariots and people more numerous than
you, do not be afraid of them, for יהוה your Elohim,
who brought you up from the land of Mitsrayim, is with you. 
Deut
20:2  “And it shall be, when you draw
near to the battle, that the priest shall come and speak to the people, 
Deut
20:3  and shall say to them, ‘Hear, O
Yisra’ĕl: You are drawing near today to battle with your enemies. Do not
let your heart faint, do not fear, or tremble, or be afraid before them, 
Deut

your Elohim is He who goes with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to
save you.’ 
Deut
20:5  “And the officers shall speak to
the people, saying, ‘Who is the man who has built a new house and has not
dedicated it? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle and
another man dedicate it.

20:6  ‘And who is the man who has planted
a vineyard and has not begun to use it? Let him also go and return to his
house, lest he die in the battle and another man should begin to use it.

his heart.’ 
Deut
20:9  “And it shall be, when the officers
have finished speaking to the people, that they shall appoint commanders of the
divisions to lead the people. 
Deut
20:10  “When you draw near to a city to
fight against it, then you shall make a call for peace to it. 
Deut
20:11  “And it shall be that if it
accepts your call for peace, and shall open to you, then all the people found
in it are to be your compulsory labour, and serve you. 
Deut
20:12  “But if it does not make peace
with you, and shall fight against you, then you shall besiege it, 
Deut
20:13  and יהוה
your Elohim shall give it into your hands, and you shall smite every male in it
with the edge of the sword. 
Deut
20:14  “Only the women, and the little
ones, and the livestock, and all that is in the city, all its spoil, you take
as plunder for yourself. And you shall eat the enemies’ plunder which יהוה
your Elohim gives you. 
Deut
20:15  “Do so to all the cities which are
very far from you, which are not of the cities of these nations. 
Deut
20:16  “Only, of the cities of these
peoples which יהוה your Elohim gives you as an
inheritance, you do not keep alive any that breathe, 
Deut
20:17  but you shall certainly put them
under the ban: the Ḥittite and the Amorite and the Kena‛anite and
the Perizzite and the Ḥiwwite and the Yeḇusite, as יהוה
your Elohim has commanded you, 
Deut

Deut
20:19  “When you besiege a city for a
long time by fighting against it to take it, you do not destroy its trees by
wielding an axe against them. If you do eat of them, do not cut them down. For
is the tree of the field a man to be besieged by you? 
Deut
20:20  “Only the trees which you know are
not trees for food you do destroy and cut down, to build siege-works against
the city that is fighting against you, until it falls. 
Deut
21:1  “When anyone is found slain, lying
in the field in the land which יהוה your Elohim is
giving you to possess, and it is not known who smote him, 
Deut
21:2  then your elders and your judges
shall go out, and they shall measure the distance from the slain man to the
cities round about. 
Deut
21:3  “And it shall be that the elders of
the city nearest to the slain man shall take a heifer which has not been worked
and which has not pulled with a yoke, 
Deut
21:4  and the elders of that city shall
bring the heifer down to a wadi with flowing water, which is neither ploughed
nor sown, and they shall break the heifer’s neck there in the wadi. 
Deut
21:5  “And the priests, the sons of Lĕwi,
shall come near, for יהוה your Elohim has chosen them
to serve Him and to bless in the Name of יהוה, and by
their mouth every strife and every stroke is tried. 
Deut
21:6  “And let all the elders of that
city nearest to the slain man wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was
broken in the wadi. 
Deut
21:7  “And they shall answer and say, ‘Our
hands have not shed this blood, nor have our eyes seen it. 
Deut
21:8  ‘O יהוה,
forgive Your people Yisra’ĕl, whom You have redeemed, and do not allow
innocent blood in the midst of Your people Yisra’ĕl.’ And the blood-guilt
shall be pardoned to them. 
Deut
21:9  “Thus you purge the guilt of
innocent blood from your midst when you do what is right in the eyes of יהוה.

Deut
21:10  “When you go out to fight against
your enemies, and יהוה your Elohim shall give them into
your hand, and you shall take them captive, 
Deut
21:11  and shall see among the captives a
woman fair of form, and shall delight in her and take her for your wife, 
Deut
21:12  then you shall bring her home to
your house, and she shall shave her head and trim her nails, 
Deut
21:13  and put aside the mantle of her
captivity, and shall dwell in your house, and mourn her father and her mother a
month of days. And after that you shall go in to her and be her husband, and
she shall be your wife. 
Deut
21:14  “And it shall be, if you are not
pleased with her, then you shall let her go at her desire, but you do not sell
her at all for silver. Do not treat her harshly, since you have humbled her. 
Deut
21:15  “When a man has two wives, one
loved and the other unloved, and they have borne him children, both the loved
and the unloved, and the first-born son is of her who is unloved, 
Deut
21:16  then it shall be, on the day he
makes his sons to inherit his possessions, he is not allowed to treat the son
of the beloved wife as first-born in the face of the son of the unloved, who is
truly the first-born. 
Deut
21:17  “But he is to acknowledge the son
of the unloved wife as the first-born by giving him a double portion of all
that he has, for he is the beginning of his strength – the right of the
first-born is his. 
Deut
21:18  “When a man has a wayward and
rebellious son who is not listening to the voice of his father or the voice of
his mother, and who, when they have disciplined him, does not listen to them,

shall take hold of him and bring him out to the elders of his city, to the gate
of his city, 
Deut
21:20  and shall say to the elders of his
city, ‘This son of ours is wayward and rebellious. He is not listening to our
voice, he is a glutton and a drunkard.’ 
Deut
21:21  “Then all the men of his city
shall stone him to death with stones. Thus you shall purge the evil from your
midst. And let all Yisra’ĕl hear, and fear. 
Deut

sin worthy of death, then he shall be put to death and you shall hang him on a
tree. 
Deut
21:23  “Let his body not remain overnight
on the tree, for you shall certainly bury him the same day – for he who is
hanged is accursed of Elohim – so that you do not defile the land which יהוה
your Elohim is giving you as an inheritance. 
Deut
22:1  “When you see your brother’s ox or
his sheep going straying away, you shall not hide yourself from them. Return
them to your brother without fail. 
Deut
22:2  “And if your brother is not near
you, or if you do not know him, then you shall bring it to your own house, and
it shall be with you until your brother seeks it, then you shall return it to
him. 
Deut
22:3  “And so you do with his donkey, and
so you do with his garment, and so you do with whatever your brother loses,

pertains to a man, nor does a man put on a woman’s garment, for whoever does
this is an abomination to יהוה your Elohim. 
Deut

along the way, in any tree or on the ground, with young ones or eggs, with the
mother sitting on the young or on the eggs, do not take the mother with the
young –

different kinds of seed, lest the yield of the seed which you have sown and the
fruit of your vineyard be defiled.

22:14  and shall make abusive charges
against her and bring an evil name on her and say, ‘I took this woman, and when
I came to her I did not find her a maiden,’

your Elohim. 
Deut
29:7  “And when you came to this place,
Siḥon sovereign of Ḥeshbon and Oḡ sovereign of Bashan came
out against us to battle, and we smote them, 
Deut
29:8  and took their land and gave it as
an inheritance to the Re’uḇĕnites, and to the Gaḏites, and to
half the tribe of Menashsheh. 
Deut
29:9  “Therefore you shall guard the
words of this covenant, and do them, so that you prosper in all that you do. 
Deut
29:10  “All of you are standing today
before יהוה your Elohim: your leaders, your tribes,
your elders and your officers, all the men of Yisra’ĕl, 
Deut
29:11  your little ones, your wives, and
your sojourner who is in the midst of your camp, from the one who cuts your
wood to the one who draws your water, 
Deut
29:12  so that you should enter into
covenant with יהוה your Elohim, and into His oath,
which יהוה your Elohim makes with you today, 
Deut
29:13  in order to establish you today as
a people for Himself, and He Himself be your Elohim, as He has spoken to you,
and as He has sworn to your fathers, to Aḇraham, to Yitsḥaq, and to
Ya‛aqoḇ. 
Deut
29:14  “And not with you alone I am
making this covenant and this oath, 
Deut
29:15  but with him who stands here with
us today before יהוה our Elohim, as well as with him
who is not here with us today. 
Deut
29:16  “For you know how we dwelt in the
land of Mitsrayim and how we passed through the nations which you passed
through, 
Deut
29:17  and you saw their abominations and
their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which were with them, 
Deut
29:18  lest there should be among you a
man or woman or clan or tribe, whose heart turns away today from יהוה
our Elohim, to go and serve the mighty ones of these nations, lest there should
be among you a root bearing bitterness or wormwood. 
Deut
29:19  “And it shall be, when he hears
the words of this curse, that he should bless himself in his heart, saying, ‘I
have peace though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart,’ in order to add
drunkenness to thirst. 
Deut
29:20  “ יהוה
would not forgive him, but rather, the displeasure of יהוה
and His jealousy shall burn against that man, and every curse that is written
in this book shall settle on him, and יהוה shall blot
out his name from under the heavens. 
Deut
29:21  “And יהוה
shall separate him for evil, out of all the tribes of Yisra’ĕl, according
to all the curses of the covenant that are written in this Book of the Torah. 
Deut
29:22  “And the generation to come of
your children who rise up after you, and the foreigner who comes from a far
land, shall say when they see the plagues of that land and the sicknesses which
יהוה has sent into it: 
Deut
29:23  ‘All its land is sulphur, salt,
and burning; it is not sown, nor does it bear, nor does any grass grow there,
like the overthrow of Seḏom and Amorah, Aḏmah and Tseḇoyim,
which יהוה overthrew in His displeasure and His wrath.’

Deut
29:24  “And all nations shall say, ‘Why
has יהוה done so to this land? What does the heat of
this great displeasure mean?’ 
Deut
29:25  “And it shall be said, ‘Because
they have forsaken the covenant of יהוה Elohim of their
fathers, which He made with them when He brought them out of the land of
Mitsrayim. 
Deut
29:26  ‘And they went and served other
mighty ones and bowed themselves to them, mighty ones that they did not know
and that He had not given to them, 
Deut
29:27  therefore the displeasure of יהוה
burned against this land, to bring on it every curse that is written in this
book. 
Deut
29:28  ‘And יהוה
uprooted them from their land in displeasure, and in wrath, and in great rage,
and cast them into another land, as it is today.’ 
Deut
29:29  “The secret matters belong to יהוה our Elohim, but what
is revealed belongs to us and to our children forever, to do all the Words of
this Torah. 
Deut
30:1  “And it shall be, when all these
words come upon you, the blessing and the curse which I have set before you,
and you shall bring them back to your heart among all the gentiles where יהוה
your Elohim drives you, 
Deut
30:2  and shall turn back to יהוה
your Elohim and obey His voice, according to all that I command you today, with
all your heart and with all your being, you and your children, 
Deut
30:3  then יהוה
your Elohim shall turn back your captivity, and shall have compassion on you,
and He shall turn back and gather you from all the peoples where יהוה
your Elohim has scattered you. 
Deut
30:4  “If any of you are driven out to
the farthest parts under the heavens, from there יהוה
your Elohim does gather you, and from there He does take you. 
Deut
30:5  “And יהוה
your Elohim shall bring you to the land which your fathers possessed, and you
shall possess it. And He shall do good to you, and increase you more than your
fathers. 
Deut
30:6  “And יהוה
your Elohim shall circumcise your heart and the heart of your seed, to love יהוה
your Elohim with all your heart and with all your being, so that you might
live, 
Deut
30:7  and יהוה
your Elohim shall put all these curses on your enemies and on those who hate
you, who persecuted you. 
Deut
30:8  “And you shall turn back and obey
the voice of יהוה and do all His commands which I
command you today. 
Deut
30:9  “And יהוה your
Elohim shall make you have excess in all the work of your hand, in the fruit of
your body, and in the fruit of your livestock, and in the fruit of your ground
for good. For יהוה turns back to rejoice over you for
good as He rejoiced over your fathers, 
Deut
30:10  if you obey the voice of יהוה
your Elohim, to guard His commands and His laws which are written in this Book
of the Torah, if you turn back to יהוה your Elohim with
all your heart and with all your being. 
Deut
30:11  “For this command which I am
commanding you today, it is not too hard for you, nor is it far off. 
Deut
30:12  “It is not in the heavens, to say,
‘Who shall ascend into the heavens for us, and bring it to us, and cause us to
hear it, so that we do it?’ 
Deut
30:13  “Nor is it beyond the sea, to say,
‘Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it to us, and cause us to hear it,
so that we do it?’ 
Deut
30:14  “For the Word is very near you, in
your mouth and in your heart – to do it. 
Deut
30:15  “See, I have set before you today
life and good, and death and evil, 
Deut
30:16  in that I am commanding you today
to love יהוה your Elohim, to walk in His ways, and to
guard His commands, and His laws, and His right-rulings. And you shall live and
increase, and יהוה your Elohim shall bless you in the
land which you go to possess. 
Deut
30:17  “But if your heart turns away, and
you do not obey, and shall be drawn away, and shall bow down to other mighty
ones and serve them, 
Deut
30:18  “I have declared to you today that
you shall certainly perish, you shall not prolong your days in the land which
you are passing over the Yardĕn to enter and possess. 
Deut
30:19  “I have called the heavens and the
earth as witnesses today against you: I have set before you life and death, the
blessing and the curse. Therefore you shall choose life, so that you live, both
you and your seed, 
Deut
30:20  to love יהוה
your Elohim, to obey His voice, and to cling to Him – for He is your life and
the length of your days – to dwell in the land which יהוה
swore to your fathers, to Aḇraham, to Yitsḥaq, and to Ya‛aqoḇ,
to give them.” 
Deut
31:1  And Mosheh went and spoke these
words to all Yisra’ĕl, 
Deut
31:2  and he said to them, “I am one
hundred and twenty years old today. I am no longer able to go out and come in.
And יהוה has said to me, ‘You do not pass over this
Yardĕn.’ 
Deut
31:3  “ יהוה your
Elohim Himself is passing over before you. He shall destroy these nations from
before you and you possess them. Yehoshua himself is passing over before you,
as יהוה has spoken. 
Deut
31:4  “And יהוה
shall do to them as He did to Siḥon and to Oḡ, the sovereigns of
the Amorites and their land, when He destroyed them. 
Deut
31:5  “And יהוה
shall give them over to you, and you shall do to them according to all the
command which I have commanded you. 
Deut
31:6  “Be strong and courageous, do not
fear nor be afraid of them. For it is יהוה your Elohim
who is going with you. He does not fail you nor forsake you.” 
Deut
31:7  And Mosheh called Yehoshua and said
to him before the eyes of all Yisra’ĕl, “Be strong and courageous, for you
are going with this people to the land which יהוה has
sworn to their fathers to give them, and you are to let them inherit it.
Deut
31:8  “And it is יהוה
who is going before you, He Himself is with you. He does not fail you nor
forsake you. Do not fear nor be discouraged.” 
Deut
31:9  And Mosheh wrote this Torah and
gave it to the priests, the sons of Lĕwi, who bore the ark of the covenant
of יהוה, and to all the elders of Yisra’ĕl. 
Deut
31:10  And Mosheh commanded them, saying,
“At the end of seven years, at the appointed time, the year of release, at the
Festival of Booths, 
Deut
31:11  when all Yisra’ĕl comes to
appear before יהוה your Elohim in the place which He
chooses, read this Torah before all Yisra’ĕl in their hearing. 
Deut
31:12  “Assemble the people, the men and
the women and the little ones, and your sojourner who is within your gates, so
that they hear, and so that they learn to fear יהוה
your Elohim and guard to do all the Words of this Torah. 
Deut
31:13  “And their children, who have not
known it, should hear and learn to fear יהוה your
Elohim as long as you live in the land you are passing over the Yardĕn to
possess.” 
Deut
31:14  And יהוה
said to Mosheh, “See, the days have drawn near for you to die. Call Yehoshua,
and present yourselves in the Tent of Meeting, so that I command him.” And
Mosheh and Yehoshua went and presented themselves in the Tent of Meeting. 
Deut
31:15  And יהוה
appeared at the Tent in a column of a cloud, and the column of a cloud stood
above the door of the Tent. 
Deut
31:16  And יהוה
said to Mosheh, “See, you are about to sleep with your fathers. And this people
shall rise and whore after the mighty ones of the strangers of the land into the
midst of which they shall enter, and forsake Me and break My covenant which I
have made with them. 
Deut
31:17  “Then My displeasure shall burn
against them in that day, and I shall forsake them and hide My face from them,
and they shall be consumed. And many evils and distresses shall come upon them,
and it shall be said in that day, ‘Is it not because our Elohim is not in our
midst that these evils have come upon us?’ 
Deut
31:18  “And I shall certainly hide My
face in that day, because of all the evil which they have done, for they shall
turn to other mighty ones. 
Deut
31:19  “And now write down this song for
yourselves, and teach it to the children of Yisra’ĕl. Put it in their
mouths, so that this song is to Me for a witness against the children of Yisra’ĕl.
Deut
31:20  “And I shall bring them to the
land flowing with milk and honey, of which I swore to their fathers, and they
shall eat and be satisfied and be fat, then they shall turn to other mighty
ones, and they shall serve them, and scorn Me and break My covenant. 
Deut
31:21  “And it shall be, when many evils
and distresses come upon them, that this song shall answer before them as a
witness. For it is not to be forgotten in the mouths of their seed, for I know
their thoughts which they are forming today, even before I bring them to the
land of which I swore to give them.” 
Deut
31:22  And Mosheh wrote this song the
same day, and taught it to the children of Yisra’ĕl. 
Deut
31:23  And He commanded Yehoshua son of
Nun, and said, “Be strong and courageous, for you are to bring the children of
Yisra’ĕl into the land of which I swore to them, and I Myself am with you.”

Deut
31:24  And it came to be, when Mosheh had
completed writing the Words of this Torah in a book, until their completion, 
Deut
31:25  that Mosheh commanded the Lĕwites,
who bore the ark of the covenant of יהוה, saying, 
Deut
31:26  “Take this Book of the Torah, and
you shall place it beside the ark of the covenant of יהוה
your Elohim, and it shall be there as a witness against you, 
Deut
31:27  for I myself know your rebellion
and your stiff neck. See, while I am still alive with you today, you have been
rebellious against יהוה, then how much more after my
death? 
Deut
31:28  “Assemble unto me all the elders
of your tribes, and your officers, so that I speak these words in their hearing
and call the heavens and the earth to witness against them. 
Deut
31:29  “For I know that after my death
you shall do very corruptly and turn aside from the way which I have commanded
you. And evil shall come to you in the latter days, because you do what is evil
in the eyes of יהוה, to provoke Him through the work of
your hands.” 
Deut
31:30  So Mosheh spoke in the hearing of
all the assembly of Yisra’ĕl the words of this song till their completion:

Deut
32:1  “Give ear, O heavens, and let me
speak; And hear, O earth, The words of my mouth.
Deut
32:2  “Let my instruction fall as rain,
My speech drop down as dew, As fine rain on the tender plants, And as showers
on the grass.
Deut
32:3  “For I proclaim the Name of יהוה,
Ascribe greatness to our Elohim.
Deut
32:4  “The Rock! His work is perfect, For
all His ways are right-ruling, An Ĕl of truth and without unrighteousness,
Righteous and straight is He.
Deut
32:5  “A twisted and crooked generation
has corrupted itself, Their blemish, they
are not His children.
Deut
32:6  “Do you do this to יהוה,
O foolish and unwise people? Is He not your Father, who bought you, Who created
you and established you?
Deut
32:7  “Remember the days of old, Consider
the years of many generations. Ask your father and let him show you, Your
elders, and let them say to you:
Deut
32:8  “When the Most High gave the
nations their inheritance When He separated the sons of Aḏam, He set the
boundaries of the peoples According to the number of the children of Yisra’ĕl.
Deut
32:9  “For the portion of יהוה
is His people, Ya‛aqoḇ His allotted inheritance.
Deut
32:10  “He found him in a wilderness, And
in a wasted, howling desert. He encompassed him, He made him understand, He
watched over him as the apple of His eye.
Deut
32:11  “As an eagle stirs up its nest,
Flutters over its young, Spreading out its wings, taking them up, Bearing them
on its wings.
Deut
32:12  “ יהוה
alone led him, And there was no strange mighty one with him.
Deut
32:13  “He made him ride in the heights
of the earth, And he ate the fruit of the fields, And He made him to draw honey
from the rock, And oil from the flinty rock,
Deut
32:14  “Curds from the cattle, And milk
of the flock, With fat of lambs, And rams of the breed of Bashan, And goats,
with the choicest wheat; And you drank wine, the blood of the grapes.
Deut
32:15  “But Yeshurun grew fat and kicked;
You grew fat, you grew thick, You are covered with fat; So he forsook Eloah who
made him, And scorned the Rock of his deliverance.
Deut
32:16  “They moved Him to jealousy with
foreign matters, With abominations
they provoked Him.
Deut
32:17  “They slaughtered to demons – not
Eloah – Mighty ones they did not know, New ones who came lately, Which your
fathers did not fear.
Deut
32:18  “You neglected the Rock who
brought you forth, And forgot the Ĕl who fathered you.
Deut
32:19  “And יהוה
saw, and despised, Because of the provocation of His sons and His daughters.
Deut
32:20  “And He said, ‘Let Me hide My face
from them, Let Me see what their end is, For they are a perverse generation,
Children in whom there is no trusting.
Deut
32:21  “They made Me jealous by what is
not Ĕl, They provoked Me with their worthless matters. But I make them jealous by those who are no people, I
provoke them with a foolish nation.
Deut
32:22  “For a fire was kindled in My
wrath And burns to the bottom of She’ol, And consumes the earth and its
increase, And sets on fire the foundations of mountains.
Deut
32:23  “I gather evils upon them, I use
up My arrows upon them –
Deut
32:24  “Wasted by scarcity of food, And
consumed by heat and bitter destruction, And the teeth of beasts I send upon
them, With the poison of serpents of the dust.
Deut
32:25  “The sword bereaves from the
outside, And fear from within, Both young man and maiden, Nursing child with
the man of grey hairs.
Deut
32:26  “I said, ‘I should blow them away,
I should make the remembrance of them To cease from among men,
Deut
32:27  ‘If I did not fear the enemy’s
taunt, Lest their adversaries misunderstand, Lest they say, “Our hand is high,
And יהוה has not done all this.” ’
Deut
32:28  “For they are a nation lost to
counsel, And there is no understanding in them.
Deut
32:29  “If they were wise, They would
understand this, They would consider their latter end!
Deut
32:30  “How would one chase a thousand,
And two put ten thousand to flight, Unless their Rock had sold them, And יהוה
had given them up?
Deut
32:31  “For their rock is not like our
Rock – Even our enemies are judges.
Deut
32:32  “Their vine is of the vine of Seḏom
And of the fields of Amorah; Their grapes are grapes of gall, Their clusters
are bitter.
Deut
32:33  “Their wine is the poison of
serpents, And the fierce venom of cobras.
Deut
32:34  ‘Is it not stored up with Me,
Sealed up among My treasures?
Deut
32:35  ‘Vengeance is Mine, and repayment,
At the time their foot slips; For near is the day of their calamity, And the matters prepared are hastening to them.’
Deut
32:36  “For יהוה
rightly rules His people And has compassion on His servants, When He sees that
their power is gone, And there is no one remaining, Shut up or at large.
Deut
32:37  “And He shall say, ‘Where are
their mighty ones, The rock in whom they sought refuge?
Deut
32:38  ‘Who ate the fat of their
slaughterings, And drank the wine of their drink offering? Let them arise and
help you, Let it be a hiding-place for you!
Deut
32:39  ‘See now that I, I am He, And
there is no Elohim besides Me. I put to death and I make alive. I have wounded,
and I heal. And from My hand no one delivers!
Deut
32:40  ‘For I lift My hand to the
heavens, And shall say: As I live forever,
Deut
32:41  ‘If I have sharpened My flashing
sword, And My hand takes hold on judgment, I shall return vengeance to My
enemies, And repay those who hate Me.
Deut
32:42  ‘I make My arrows drunk with
blood, And My sword devours flesh, With the blood of the slain and the
captives, From the long-haired enemy chiefs.’
Deut
32:43  “O nations, acclaim His people!
For He avenges the blood of His servants, And returns vengeance to His
adversaries, And shall pardon His land, His people.”
Deut
32:44  Then Mosheh came, with Yehoshua
son of Nun, and spoke all the words of this song in the hearing of the people. 
Deut
32:45  And when Mosheh ended speaking all
these words to all Yisra’ĕl, 
Deut
32:46  he said to them, “Set your heart
on all the words with which I warn you today, so that you command your children
to guard to do all the Words of this Torah. 
Deut
32:47  “For it is not a worthless Word
for you, because it is your life, and by this Word you prolong your days on the
soil which you pass over the Yardĕn to possess.” 
Deut
32:48  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh that same day, saying, 
Deut
32:49  “Go up this mountain of the Aḇarim,
Mount Neḇo, which is in the land of Mo’aḇ, which is opposite
Yeriḥo, and look at the land of Kena‛an, which I give to the
children of Yisra’ĕl as a possession, 
Deut
32:50  and die on the mountain which you
ascend, and be gathered to your people, as Aharon your brother died on Mount
Hor and was gathered to his people, 
Deut
32:51  because you trespassed against Me
in the midst of the children of Yisra’ĕl at the waters of Meriḇah Qaḏĕsh,
in the Wilderness of Tsin, because you did not set Me apart in the midst of the
children of Yisra’ĕl. 
Deut
32:52  “For you are to look at the land
before you, but not enter there, into the land which I am giving to the
children of Yisra’ĕl.” 
Deut
33:1  And this is the blessing with which
Mosheh the man of Elohim blessed the children of Yisra’ĕl before his
death. 
Deut
33:2  And he said, “ יהוה
came from Sinai, and rose from Sĕ‛ir for them. He shone forth from
Mount Paran, and came with ten thousands of set-apart ones – at His right hand
a law of fire for them. 
Deut
33:3  Indeed, He loves the peoples, all
His set-apart ones are in Your hand. And they, they sat down at Your feet,
receiving Your Words. 
Deut
33:4  Mosheh commanded us a Torah, an
inheritance of the assembly of Ya‛aqoḇ. 
Deut
33:5  And He was Sovereign in Yeshurun,
when the heads of the people were gathered, the tribes of Yisra’ĕl. 
Deut
33:6  “Let Re’uḇĕn live, and
not die, and let his men be numbered.” 
Deut
33:7  And this of Yehuḏah, and he
said, “Hear, יהוה, the voice of Yehuḏah, and
bring him to his people. His hands shall fight for him, and You be a help
against his enemies.” 
Deut
33:8  And of Lĕwi he said, “Your
Tummim and Your Urim belong to Your kind one, whom You tried at Massah, with
whom You contended at the waters of Meriḇah, 
Deut
33:9  who said of his father and mother, ‘I
have not seen them.’ And he did not acknowledge his brothers, or know his own
children, for they have guarded Your Word and watched over Your covenant. 
Deut
33:10  “They teach Your right-rulings to
Ya‛aqoḇ, and Your Torah to Yisra’ĕl. They put incense before
You, and a complete burnt offering on Your altar. 
Deut
33:11  “O יהוה,
bless his strength, and accept the work of his hands. Smite the loins of those
who rise against him, and of those who hate him, that they rise no more.” 
Deut
33:12  Of Binyamin he said, “Let the
beloved of יהוה dwell in safety by Him, shielding him
all the day, as he dwells between His shoulders.” 
Deut
33:13  And of Yosĕph he said, “Blessed
of יהוה is his land, with the choicest from the
heavens, with the dew, and the deep lying beneath, 
Deut
33:14  with the choice fruits of the sun,
with the choice yield of the months, 
Deut
33:15  with the finest of the ancient
mountains, with the choicest of the everlasting hills, 
Deut
33:16  with the choicest of the earth and
all that fills it, and the good pleasure of Him who dwelt in the bush. Let it
come on the head of Yosĕph, and on the crown of the head of him who was
separate from his brothers. 
Deut
33:17  “His splendour is like a first-born
bull, and his horns are like the horns of the wild ox. With them he pushes the
peoples to the ends of the earth. And they are the ten thousands of Ephrayim,
and they are the thousands of Menashsheh.” 
Deut
33:18  And of Zeḇulun he said, “Rejoice,
O Zeḇulun, in your going out, and Yissasḵar in your tents! 
Deut
33:19  “They call peoples to the
mountain, there they bring offerings of righteousness, for they draw from the
riches of the seas, and treasures hidden in the sand.” 
Deut
33:20  And of Gaḏ he said, “Blessed
is he who enlarges Gaḏ. He dwells as a lion, and shall tear off the arm,
also the crown. 
Deut
33:21  “And he chose the best for
himself, for there the portion of the lawgiver was hidden. And he came with the
heads of the people. The righteousness of יהוה he did,
and His right-rulings with Yisra’ĕl.”
Deut
33:22  And of Dan he said, “Dan is a lion’s
cub, that leaps from Bashan.” 
Deut
33:23  And of Naphtali he said, “O
Naphtali, satisfied with pleasure, and filled with the blessing of יהוה,
possess the west and the south.” 
Deut
33:24  And of Ashĕr he said, “Ashĕr
is most blessed of sons. Let him be accepted by his brothers, and dip his foot
in oil. 
Deut
33:25  “Your sandals are iron and bronze,
and your strength as your days. 
Deut
33:26  “O Yeshurun, there is no one like Ĕl,
riding the heavens to help you, and on the clouds, in His excellency. 
Deut
33:27  “The Elohim of old is a refuge,
and beneath are everlasting arms. And He drives out the enemy from before you
and says, ‘Destroy!’ 
Deut
33:28  “Thus Yisra’ĕl dwells in
safety, the fountain of Ya‛aqoḇ alone, in a land of grain and new
wine. His heavens also drop down dew. 
Deut
33:29  “Blessed are you, O Yisra’ĕl!
Who is like you, a people saved by יהוה, the shield of
your help, and He who is the sword of your excellency! And your enemies are
subdued for you, and you tread down their high places.” 
Deut
34:1  And Mosheh went up from the desert
plains of Mo’aḇ to Mount Neḇo, to the top of Pisgah, which is
opposite Yeriḥo. And יהוה showed him all the land
of Gil‛aḏ as far as Dan, 
Deut
34:2  and all Naphtali and the land of
Ephrayim and Menashsheh, all the land of Yehuḏah as far as the Western

which יהוה sent him to do in the land of Mitsrayim,
before Pharaoh, and before all his servants, and in all his land,

all the great fearsome deeds which Mosheh did before the eyes of all Yisra’ĕl.
