Ya‛aqoḇ/James
James
1:1  Ya‛aqoḇ, a servant of
Elohim and of the Master יהושע Messiah, to the
twelve tribes who are in the dispersion: Greetings. 
James
1:2  My brothers, count it all joy when
you fall into various trials, 
James
1:3  knowing that the proving of your
belief works endurance. 
James
1:4  And let endurance have a perfect
work, so that you be perfect and complete, lacking in naught. 
James
1:5  If any of you lacks wisdom, let him
ask of Elohim, who gives to all generously and without reproach, and it shall
be given to him. 
James
1:6  But he should ask in belief, not
doubting, for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven and tossed by the
wind. 
James
1:7  For that man should not think that
he shall receive whatever from the Master – 
James
1:8  he is a double-minded man, unstable
in all his ways. 
James
1:9  And let the lowly brother boast in
his exaltation, 
James
1:10  but the rich in his humiliation,
because as a flower of the field he shall pass away. 
James
1:11  For the sun rose with burning heat,
and withered the grass, and its flower fell, and its pretty appearance
perished. So also the rich man shall fade away in his ways. 
James
1:12  Blessed is the man who does endure
trial, for when he has been proved, he shall receive the crown of life which
the Master has promised to those who love Him. 
James
1:13  Let no one say when he is enticed, “I
am enticed by Elohim,” for Elohim is not enticed by evil matters, and He entices no one. 
James
1:14  But each one is enticed when he is
drawn away by his own desires and trapped. 
James
1:15  Then, when desire has conceived, it
gives birth to sin. And sin, when it has been accomplished, brings forth death.

James
1:16  Do not go astray, my beloved
brothers. 
James
1:17  Every good gift and every perfect
gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is
no change, nor shadow of turning.
James
1:18  Having purposed it, He brought us
forth by the Word of truth, for us to be a kind of first-fruits of His
creatures. 
James
1:19  So then, my beloved brothers, let
every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath, 
James
1:20  for the wrath of man does not work
the righteousness of Elohim. 
James
1:21  Therefore put away all filthiness
and overflow of evil, and receive with meekness the implanted Word, which is
able to save your lives.
James
1:22  And become doers of the Word, and
not hearers only, deceiving yourselves.
James
1:23  Because if anyone is a hearer of
the Word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks at his natural face in a
mirror, 
James
1:24  for he looks at himself, and goes
away, and immediately forgets what he was like. 
James
1:25  But he that looked into the perfect
Torah, that of freedom, and continues in it, not becoming a hearer that
forgets, but a doer of work, this one shall be blessed in his doing of the Torah.
James
1:26  If anyone among you thinks he is
religious, and does not bridle his tongue but deceives his own heart, this one’s
religion is worthless. 
James
1:27  Clean and undefiled religion before
the Elohim and Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction,
and to keep oneself unstained from
the world. 
James
2:1  My brothers, do not hold the belief
of our Master יהושע Messiah, the Master of
esteem, with partiality. 
James
2:2  For if there should come into your
meeting a man with gold rings, in a splendid robe, and there should also come
in a poor one dressed in rags, 
James
2:3  and you pay attention to the one
wearing the splendid robe and say to him, “You sit here in a good place,” and
say to the poor one, “You stand there,” or, “Sit here by my feet,” 
James
2:4  have you not discriminated among
yourselves, and become judges with wicked thoughts? 
James
2:5  Listen, my beloved brothers: Has
Elohim not chosen the poor of this world, rich in belief and heirs of the reign
which He promised to those who love Him? 
James
2:6  But you have shown disrespect
towards the poor man. Do not the rich oppress you and drag you into the courts?

James
2:7  Do they not blaspheme that good Name
by which you are called? 
James
2:8  If you truly accomplish the
sovereign law according to the Scripture, “You shall love your neighbour as
yourself,” you do well, 
James
2:9  but if you show partiality, you
commit sin, being found guilty by the Torah as transgressors. 
James
2:10  For whoever shall guard all the
Torah, and yet stumble in one point, he is guilty of all. 
James
2:11  For He who said, “Do not commit
adultery,” also said, “Do not murder.” Now if you do not commit adultery, but
you do murder, you have become a transgressor of Torah. 
James
2:12  So speak and so do as those who are
to be judged by a Torah of freedom.
James
2:13  For the judgment is without
compassion to the one who has shown no compassion. And compassion boasts over
judgment. 
James
2:14  My brothers, what use is it for
anyone to say he has belief but does not have works? This belief is unable to
save him. 
James
2:15  And if a brother or sister is naked
and in need of daily food, 
James
2:16  but one of you says to them, “Go in
peace, be warmed and be filled,” but you do not give them the bodily needs,
what use is it? 
James
2:17  So also belief, if it does not have
works, is in itself dead. 
James
2:18  But someone might say, “You have
belief, and I have works.” Show me your belief without your works, and I shall
show you my belief by my works. 
James
2:19  You believe that Elohim is one. You
do well. The demons also believe – and shudder! 
James
2:20  But do you wish to know, O foolish
man, that the belief without the works is dead? 
James
2:21  Was not Aḇraham our father
declared right by works when he offered Yitsḥaq his son on the altar? 
James
2:22  Do you see that the belief was
working with his works, and by the works the belief was perfected? 
James
2:23  And the Scripture was filled which
says, “Aḇraham believed Elohim, and it was reckoned to him for
righteousness.” And he was called, “Elohim’s friend.”
James
2:24  You see, then, that a man is
declared right by works, and not by belief alone. 
James
2:25  In the same way, was not Raḥaḇ
the whore also declared right by works when she received the messengers and
sent them out another way? 
James
2:26  For as the body without the spirit
is dead, so also the belief is dead without the works. 
James
3:1  Not many of you should become
teachers, my brothers, knowing that we shall receive greater judgment. 
James
3:2  For we all stumble in many matters. If anyone does not stumble in
word, he is a perfect man, able also to bridle the entire body. 
James
3:3  Look, we put bits in the mouths of
horses, for them to obey us, and we turn their body. 
James
3:4  Look at the ships too: although they
are so big and are driven by strong winds, they are turned by a very small
rudder wherever the pilot intends. 
James
3:5  So too the tongue is a little
member, yet boasts greatly. See how a little fire kindles a great forest! 
James
3:6  And the tongue is a fire, the world
of unrighteousness. Among our members the tongue is set, the one defiling the
entire body, and setting on fire the wheel of life, and it is set on fire by
Gehenna. 
James
3:7  For every kind of beast and bird, of
reptile and creature of the sea, is tamed and has been tamed by mankind. 
James
3:8  But no man is able to tame the
tongue. It is unruly, evil, filled with deadly poison. 
James
3:9  With it we bless our Elohim and
Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in the likeness of Elohim.
James
3:10  Out of the same mouth proceed
blessing and cursing. My brothers, this should not be so. 
James
3:11  Does the fountain send forth the
sweet and the bitter from the same opening? 
James
3:12  My brothers, is a fig tree able to
bear olives, or a grapevine figs? So neither is a fountain able to make salt and sweet water. 
James
3:13  Who is wise and understanding among
you? Let him show by his good behaviour his works in meekness of wisdom. 
James
3:14  But if you have bitter jealousy and
self-seeking in your hearts, do not boast against and lie against the truth. 
James
3:15  This is not the wisdom coming down
from above, but it is earthly, unspiritual, demonic. 
James
3:16  For where jealousy and self-seeking
are, there is confusion and every foul deed. 
James
3:17  But the wisdom from above is first
clean, then peaceable, gentle, ready to obey, filled with compassion and good
fruits, without partiality and without hypocrisy. 
James
3:18  And the fruit of righteousnessis
sown in peace by those who make peace.
James
4:1  Where do fightings and strivings
come from among you? Do they not come from your pleasures that battle in your
members? 
James
4:2  You desire, and do not have. You
murder, and are jealous, and are unable to obtain. You strive and fight, and
you do not possess, because you do not ask. 
James
4:3  You ask and do not receive, because
you ask evilly, in order to spend it on your pleasures. 
James
4:4  Adulterers and adulteresses! Do you
not know that friendship with the world is enmity with Elohim? Whoever
therefore intends to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of Elohim.
James
4:5  Or do you think that the Scripture
speaks to no purpose? Does the Spirit which dwells in us intensely crave unto
envy? 
James
4:6  But He gives greater favour. Because
of this He says, “Elohim resists the proud, but gives favour to the humble.”
James
4:7  So then subject yourselves to
Elohim. Resist the devil and he shall flee from you.
James
4:8  Draw near to Elohim and He shall
draw near to you. Cleanse hands, sinners. And cleanse the hearts, you
double-minded! 
James
4:9  Lament and mourn and weep! Let your
laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to dejection. 
James
4:10  Humble yourselves in the sight of
the Master, and He shall lift you up. 
James
4:11  Brothers, do not speak against one
another. He that speaks against a brother and judges his brother, speaks
against Torah and judges Torah. And if you judge Torah, you are not a doer of
Torah but a judge. 
James
4:12  There is one Lawgiver and Judge,
who is able to save and to destroy. Who are you to judge another? 
James
4:13  Come now, you who say, “Today or
tomorrow, let us go to such and such a city, spend a year there, and trade, and
make a profit,” 
James
4:14  when you do not know of tomorrow.
For what is your life? For it is a vapour that appears for a little, and then
disappears – 
James
4:15  instead of your saying, “If the
Master desires, we shall live and do this or that.” 
James
4:16  But now you boast in your proud
speeches. All such boasting is wicked. 
James
4:17  To him, then, who knows to do good
and does not do it, to him it is sin. 
James
5:1  Come now, rich ones, weep, crying
aloud over the hardships coming upon you! 
James
5:2  Your riches have rotted, and your
garments have become moth-eaten. 
James
5:3  Your gold and silver have become
rusty, and their rust shall be a witness against you and shall eat your flesh
like fire. You have laid up treasure in the last days. 
James
5:4  See, the wages of the workmen who
mowed your fields, which you kept back, cry out. And the cries of the reapers
have reached the ears of יהוה of hosts.
James
5:5  You have lived on the earth in
pleasure and luxury, you have fattened your hearts, as in a day of slaughter. 
James
5:6  You have condemned, you have
murdered the righteous – he does not resist you. 
James
5:7  So, brothers, be patient until the
coming of the Master. See, the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the
earth, waiting patiently for it until it receives the early and latter rain. 
James
5:8  You too, be patient. Establish your
hearts, for the coming of the Master has drawn near. 
James
5:9  Do not grumble against each other,
brothers, lest you be judged. See, the Judge is standing at the door! 
James
5:10  My brothers, as an example of
suffering and patience, take the prophets, who spoke in the Name of יהוה.

James
5:11  See, we call those blessed who
endure. You have heard of the endurance of Iyoḇ and saw the purpose of יהוה,
that He is very sympathetic and compassionate. 
James
5:12  But above all, my brothers, do not
swear, either by the heaven or by the earth or with any other oath. But let your
Yes be Yes, and your No, No, lest you fall into judgment. 
James
5:13  Is any of you suffering evil? Let
him pray. Is anyone in good spirits? Let him sing psalms. 
James
5:14  Is anyone among you sick? Let him
call for the elders of the assembly, and let them pray over him, having
anointed him with oil in the Name of the Master. 
James
5:15  And the prayer of the belief shall
save the sick, and the Master shall raise him up. And if he has committed sins,
he shall be forgiven. 
James
5:16  Confess your trespasses to one
another, and pray for one another, so that you are healed. The earnest prayer
of a righteous one accomplishes much. 
James
5:17  Ĕliyahu was a man with
feelings like us, and he prayed earnestly that it would not rain. And it did
not rain on the land for three years and six months. 
James
5:18  And he prayed again, and the heaven
gave rain, and the land brought forth its fruit. 
James
5:19  Brothers, if anyone among you goes
astray from the truth, and someone turns him back, 
James
5:20  let him know that he who turns a
sinner from the straying of his way shall save a life from death and cover a
great number of sins.
