Shir haShirim/Song of Songs
Song
1:1  The song of songs, which is Shelomoh’s.
Song
1:2  Let him kiss me with the kisses of
his mouth, For your loves are better than wine.
Song
1:3  For fragrance your oils are good.
Your name is oil poured forth,
Song
1:4  Draw me! We run after you. The
sovereign has brought me into his inner rooms. We exult and rejoice in you. We
praise your loves more than wine. Rightly do they love you.
Song
1:5  I am dark, but lovely, O daughters
of Yerushalayim, Like the tents of Qĕḏar, Like the curtains of
Shelomoh.
Song
1:6  Do not look upon me, because I am
dark, Because the sun has tanned me. My mother’s sons were displeased with me.
They made me the keeper of the vineyards, My own vineyard I have not kept.
Song
1:7  Make known to me, O you whom my
being loves, Where you feed your flock,
Where you make it rest at noon. For why should I be as one who is veiled Beside
the flocks of your companions?
Song
1:8  If you do not know, O fairest among
women, Go in the footsteps of the flock, And feed your little goats beside the
shepherds’ dwellings.
Song
1:9  I have compared you, my love, To my
filly among Pharaoh’s chariots.
Song
1:10  Your cheeks are pretty with
ornaments, Your neck with strings of beads.
Song
1:11  Let us make you ornaments of gold
with studs of silver. 
Song
1:12  While the sovereign is at his
table, My nard shall give its fragrance.
Song
1:13  My beloved is a bundle of myrrh to
me, Lying between my breasts.
Song
1:14  My beloved is to me a cluster of
henna blooms In the vineyards of Ĕn Geḏi.
Song
1:15  See, you are fair, my love! See,
you are fair! Your eyes are as doves.
Song
1:16  See, you are handsome, my beloved!
Yea, pleasant! Also our bed is green.
Song
1:17  The beams of our houses are cedar,
our rafters are of fir.
Song
2:1  I am the rose of Sharon, The lily of
the valleys.
Song
2:2  Like a lily among thorns, So is my
love among the daughters.
Song
2:3  Like an apple tree among the trees
of the forest, So is my beloved among the sons. I delighted in his shade and
sat down, And his fruit was sweet to my taste.
Song
2:4  He brought me to the house of wine,
And his banner over me was love.
Song
2:5  “Strengthen me with raisin cakes,
Refresh me with apples, for I am faint with love.”
Song
2:6  His left hand is under my head, And
his right hand embraces me.
Song
2:7  I have put you under oath, O
daughters of Yerushalayim, By the gazelles or by the does of the field, Do not
stir up nor awaken love until it pleases.
Song
2:8  The voice of my beloved! See, he is
coming, Leaping on the mountains, skipping on the hills.
Song
2:9  My beloved is like a gazelle or like
a young stag. See, he is standing behind our wall, Looking through the windows,
Peering through the lattice.
Song
2:10  My beloved responded and said to
me, “Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.
Song
2:11  “For look, the winter is past, the
rain is over, gone.
Song
2:12  “The flowers have appeared in the
earth; The time of singing has come, And the voice of the turtledove has been
heard in our land.
Song
2:13  “The fig tree has ripened her figs,
And the vines with the tender grapes have given a good fragrance. Rise up, my
love, my fair one, and come away!
Song
2:14  “O my dove, in the clefts of the
rock, In the covering of the cliff, Let me see your appearance, Let me hear
your voice; For your voice is sweet, And your appearance is lovely.”
Song
2:15  Catch the foxes for us, The little
foxes that spoil the vines, And our vines are all blossom.
Song
2:16  My beloved is mine, and I am his.
He feeds his flock among the lilies.
Song
2:17  Until the day breaks and the
shadows have fled, Turn, my beloved, And be like a gazelle or a young stag On
the mountains of Bether.
Song
3:1  On my bed at night I sought the
beloved of my being; I sought him, but I did not find him.
Song
3:2  “Come, let me arise, and go about
the city, In the streets and in the broad places I seek the beloved of my
being.” I sought him, but I did not find him.
Song
3:3  The watchmen who go about the city
found me, to whom I said, “Have you seen the beloved of my being?”
Song
3:4  Scarcely had I passed by them, When
I found the beloved of my being. I held him and would not let him go, Until I
had brought him to the house of my mother, And into the room of her who
conceived me.
Song
3:5  I have put you under oath, O
daughters of Yerushalayim, By the gazelles or by the does of the field, Do not
stir up nor awaken love until it pleases.
Song
3:6  Who is this coming out of the
wilderness Like columns of smoke, Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, From
all the merchant’s fragrant powders?
Song
3:7  See, it is Shelomoh’s couch – Sixty
mighty men are around it, Of the mighty men of Yisra’ĕl,
Song
3:8  All of them holding swords, Skilled
in battle, Each one has his sword on his thigh Because of fear in the night.
Song
3:9  Sovereign Shelomoh made himself A
litter of the wood of Leḇanon;
Song
3:10  He made its posts of silver, Its
support of gold, its seat of purple, Within it was decked with love By the
daughters of Yerushalayim.
Song
3:11  Go forth, O daughters of Tsiyon,
And see Sovereign Shelomoh with the crown With which his mother crowned him on
the day of his wedding, And on the day of his gladness of heart.
Song
4:1  See, you are fair, my love! See, you
are fair! Your eyes are as doves behind your veil. Your hair is like a flock of
goats, Going down from Mount Gil‛aḏ.
Song
4:2  Your teeth are like a flock of shorn
sheep Which have come up from the
washing, All of them bear twins, and not one loses her young.
Song
4:3  Your lips are like a cord of
scarlet, And your speech is lovely. Your cheeks behind your veil are like a
piece of pomegranate.
Song
4:4  Your neck is like the tower of Dawiḏ,
Built for an armoury, On which hang a thousand shields, All the armour of
mighty men.
Song
4:5  Your two breasts are like two fawns,
Twins of a gazelle, pasturing among the lilies.
Song
4:6  Until the day breaks and the shadows
have fled, I shall go my way to the mountain of myrrh, And to the hill of
frankincense.
Song
4:7  You are all fair, my love, and not a
blemish is on you.
Song
4:8  Come with me from Leḇanon, My
bride, with me from Leḇanon. Look from the top of Amana, From the top of
Shenir and Ḥermon, From the dens of lions, From the mountains of the
leopards.
Song
4:9  You have put heart into me, My
sister, my bride; You have put heart into me With one glance of your eyes, With one bead of your necklace.
Song
4:10  How sweet have been your loves, My
sister, my bride! How much better than wine are your loves, And the fragrance
of your perfumes than all spices!
Song
4:11  Your lips, O my bride, drip as the
honeycomb; Honey and milk are under your tongue. And the fragrance of your
garments Is like the fragrance of Leḇanon.
Song
4:12  A garden locked is my sister, my
bride, A fountain locked, a spring sealed up.
Song
4:13  Your plants are an orchard of
pomegranates with pleasant fruits, With henna, nard,
Song
4:14  Nard and saffron, Calamus and
cinnamon, With all trees of frankincense, Myrrh and aloes, With all the chief
spices;
Song
4:15  A garden spring, A well of living
waters, And streams from Leḇanon.
Song
4:16  Awake, O north wind, and come, O
south! Blow upon my garden, let its spices flow out. Let my beloved come to his
garden And eat its pleasant fruits.
Song
5:1  I have come to my garden, My sister,
my bride; I have plucked my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with
my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk. Eat, O friends! Drink, and drink
deeply, O beloved ones!
Song
5:2  I was sleeping, But my heart was
awake – the voice of my beloved! He knocks, “Open for me, my sister, My love,
my dove, my perfect one; For my head is drenched with dew, My locks with the
drops of the night.”
Song
5:3  I have taken off my robe, should I
put it on? I have washed my feet, should I dirty them?
Song
5:4  My beloved put his hand by the
latch, And my feelings were deeply moved for him.
Song
5:5  I rose to open for my beloved, And
my hands dripped with myrrh, My fingers with flowing myrrh, On the handles of
the lock.
Song
5:6  I opened for my beloved, But my
beloved had turned away, had gone. My being went out when he spoke. I sought
him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.
Song
5:7  The watchmen who went about the city
found me. They struck me, they bruised me; The keepers of the walls lifted my
veil from me.
Song
5:8  I have put you under oath, O
daughters of Yerushalayim, If you find my beloved, That you inform him that I
am faint with love!
Song
5:9  What kind of a beloved is your
beloved, O fairest among women? What kind of a beloved is your beloved, That
you have put us under oath?
Song
5:10  My beloved is dazzling and ruddy,
Chief among ten thousand.
Song
5:11  His head is refined gold; His locks
are wavy, black as a raven.
Song
5:12  His eyes are like doves by streams
of waters, Washed with milk, and fitly set.
Song
5:13  His cheeks are like a bed of
spices, Raised bed of scented plants. His lips are lilies, dripping flowing
myrrh.
Song
5:14  His hands are rods of gold set with
beryl. His body is carved ivory, covered with sapphires.
Song
5:15  His legs are columns of marble
Founded on sockets of fine gold. His appearance is like Leḇanon, Choice
as the cedars.
Song
5:16  His mouth is most sweet, And he is
altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of
Yerushalayim!
Song
6:1  “Where has your beloved gone, O
fairest among women? Where has your beloved turned aside? Let us seek him with
you.”
Song
6:2  My beloved went down to his garden,
To the beds of spices, To feed his flock
in the gardens, And to gather lilies.
Song
6:3  I am my beloved’s, and my beloved is
mine. He feeds his flock among the
lilies.
Song
6:4  O my love, you are as fair as
Tirtsah, Lovely as Yerushalayim, Awesome as an army with banners!
Song
6:5  Turn your eyes away from me, Because
they overcome me. Your hair is like a flock of goats That have hopped down from
Gil‛aḏ.
Song
6:6  Your teeth are like a flock of sheep
That have come up from the washing; All of them bear twins, And not one among
them has lost her young.
Song
6:7  Your cheeks behind your veil are
like a piece of pomegranate.
Song
6:8  There are sixty sovereignesses and
eighty concubines, And innumerable maidens.
Song
6:9  My dove, my perfect one, Is the only
one, the only one of her mother, The choice of the one who bore her. The
daughters saw, and called her blessed, Sovereignesses and concubines, And they
praised her.
Song
6:10  Who is she who shines forth as the
morning, Fair as the moon, clear as the sun, Awesome as an army with banners?
Song
6:11  I went down to the garden of nuts
To see the budding of the wadi, To see whether the vine had budded and the
pomegranates had bloomed.
Song
6:12  I did not know, my desire made me
as the chariots of my noble people. 
Song
6:13  Return, return, O Shulammith;
Return, return, and let us look upon you! Why should you look upon the
Shulammith, As it were the dance of two armies?
Song
7:1  How fair are your feet in sandals, O
daughter of a noble! The curves of your thighs are like ornaments, The work of
a craftsman’s hands.
Song
7:2  Your navel is a rounded bowl Let it
not lack mixed wine. Your body is a heap of wheat, Hedged about with lilies.
Song
7:3  Your two breasts are like two fawns,
twins of a gazelle. 
Song
7:4  Your neck is like an ivory tower,
Your eyes pools in Ḥeshbon By the gate of Bath Rabbim. Your nose is like
the tower of Leḇanon looking to Damascus.
Song
7:5  Your head upon you is like Mount
Karmel, And the hair of your head like purple; The sovereign is held captive by
the ringlets.
Song
7:6  How fair and how pleasant you are, O
love, in delights! 
Song
7:7  This stature of yours compares to a
palm tree, And your breasts to clusters.
Song
7:8  I said, “Let me go up to the palm
tree, Let me take hold of its tips.” And please, let your breasts be like
clusters of the vine, And the fragrance of your breath like apples,
Song
7:9  And your palate like the best wine,
Going down smoothly for my beloved, Flowing gently, slumbering lips.
Song
7:10  I am my beloved’s, and his desire
is toward me. 
Song
7:11  Come, my beloved, let us go forth
to the field; Let us stay in the villages.
Song
7:12  Let us get up early to the
vineyards; Let us see whether the vine has budded, The grape blossoms have
opened, The pomegranates have bloomed. There I give you my loves.
Song
7:13  The love-apples have given
fragrance, And at our gates are all pleasant fruit, New and old, which I have laid up for you, my beloved.
Song
8:1  Who would make you a brother to me,
Who nursed at my mother’s breasts! Should I find you outside, I would kiss you;
I would not be despised.
Song
8:2  I would lead you, I would bring you
into the house of my mother, She who has taught me. I would give you spiced
wine to drink, Of the juice of my pomegranate.
Song
8:3  His left hand is under my head, And
his right hand embraces me.
Song
8:4  I have put you under oath, O
daughters of Yerushalayim, Do not stir up or awake love until it pleases.
Song
8:5  Who is this coming up from the
wilderness, Leaning upon her beloved? Under the apple tree I awakened you.
There your mother was in labour with you; There she was in labour, gave birth
to you.
Song
8:6  Set me as a seal upon your heart, As
a seal upon your arm; For love is as strong as death, Jealousy as cruel as the
grave; Its flames are flames of fire, a flame of Yah!
Song
8:7  Many waters are unable to extinguish
love, And floods do not wash it away. If one would give all the wealth of his
house for love, It would be utterly scorned.
Song
8:8  We have a little sister, and she has
no breasts. What do we do for our sister in the day when she is spoken for?
Song
8:9  If she is a wall, we build upon her
a battlement of silver. And if she is a door, we would enclose her with boards
of cedar.
Song
8:10  I am a wall, and my breasts like
towers; So I became in his eyes as one who found peace.
Song
8:11  Shelomoh had a vineyard in Ba‛al
Hamon; He let out the vineyard to keepers; Each one was to bring for its fruit
a thousand pieces of silver.
Song
8:12  My own vineyard is before me. O
Shelomoh, a thousand belongs to you, And two hundred to those who keep its
fruit.
Song
8:13  You who sit in the gardens, The
companions listen for your voice; Let me hear it!
Song
8:14  Hurry, my beloved, And be like a
gazelle or a young stag On the mountains of spices.
