Ma`asei/Acts
Acts
1:1  The first account I made, O
Theophilos, of all that יהושע began both to do
and to teach, 
Acts
1:2  until the day when He was taken up,
after giving instructions through the Set-apart Spirit to the emissaries whom
He had chosen, 
Acts
1:3  to whom He also presented Himself
alive after His suffering by many infallible proofs, being seen by them for
forty days, speaking concerning the reign of Elohim. 
Acts
1:4  And meeting with them, He commanded
them not to leave Yerushalayim, but to wait for the Promise of the Father, “which
you have heard from Me –
Acts
1:5  because Yoḥanan truly immersed
in water, but you shall be immersed in the Set-apart Spirit not many days from
now.” 
Acts
1:6  So when they had come together, they
asked Him, saying, “Master, would You at this time restore the reign to Yisra’ĕl?”
Acts
1:7  And He said to them, “It is not for
you to know times or seasons which the Father has put in His own authority. 
Acts
1:8  “But you shall receive power when
the Set-apart Spirit has come upon you, and you shall be My witnesses in
Yerushalayim, and in all Yehuḏah and Shomeron, and to the end of the
earth.” 
Acts
1:9  And having said this, while they
were looking on, He was taken up, and a cloud hid Him from their sight. 
Acts
1:10  And as they were gazing into the
heaven as He went up, see, two men stood by them dressed in white, 
Acts
1:11  who also said, “Men of Galil, why
do you stand looking up into the heaven? This same יהושע,
who was taken up from you into the heaven, shall come in the same way as you
saw Him go into the heaven.”
Acts
1:12  Then they went back to Yerushalayim
from the Mount of Olives, which is near Yerushalayim, a Sabbath day’s journey. 
Acts
1:13  And when they came in, they went up
into the upper room where they were staying: both Kĕpha and Ya‛aqoḇ
and Yoḥanan and Andri, Philip and T’oma, Bartholomi and Mattithyahu, Ya‛aqoḇ
the son of Alphai and Shim‛on
the Zealot, and Yehuḏah the son
of Ya‛aqoḇ. 
Acts
1:14  All these were continuing with one
mind in prayer and supplication, with the women and Miryam the mother of יהושע,
and with His brothers. 
Acts
1:15  And in those days Kĕpha,
standing up in the midst of the taught ones – and there was a gathering of about
a hundred and twenty – said, 
Acts
1:16  “Men and brothers, this Scripture
had to be filled which the Set-apart Spirit spoke before by the mouth of Dawiḏ
concerning Yehuḏah, who became a guide to those who seized יהושע,

Acts
1:17  because he was numbered with us and
did receive his share in this service.” 
Acts
1:18  (This one, therefore, purchased a
field with the wages of unrighteousness, and falling forward, he burst open in
the middle and all his intestines gushed out. 
Acts
1:19  And it became known to all those
dwelling in Yerushalayim, so that in their own language that field was called, Ḥaqal
Dema, that is, Field of Blood). 
Acts
1:20  “For it has been written in the
Book of Psalms, ‘Let his dwelling lie waste, and let no one live in it,’ and, ‘Let
another take his office.’ 
Acts
1:21  “It is therefore necessary that of
the men who have been with us all the time that the Master יהושע
went in and out among us, 
Acts
1:22  beginning from the immersion of
Yoḥanan to that day when He was taken up from us, that one of these
should become a witness with us of His resurrection.” 
Acts
1:23  And they put forward two: Yosĕph
called Barsabba, who was also called Justus, and Mattithyahu. 
Acts
1:24  And praying they said, “You, יהוה,
who know the hearts of all, show which one of these two You have chosen 
Acts
1:25  to receive the share in this
service and office of the emissary from which Yehuḏah by transgression
fell, to go to his own place.” 
Acts
1:26  And they cast their lots, and the
lot fell on Mattithyahu. And he was numbered with the eleven emissaries. 
Acts
2:1  And when the Day of the Festival of
Weeks had come, they were all with one mind in one place. 
Acts
2:2  And suddenly there came a sound from
the heaven, as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they
were sitting. 
Acts
2:3  And there appeared to them divided
tongues, as of fire, and settled on each one of them. 
Acts
2:4  And they were all filled with the
Set-apart Spirit and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them
to speak. 
Acts
2:5  Now in Yerushalayim there were
dwelling Yehuḏim, dedicated men from every nation under the heaven. 
Acts
2:6  And when this sound came to be, the
crowd came together, and were confused, because everyone heard them speak in
his own language. 
Acts
2:7  And they were all amazed and
marvelled, saying to each other, “Look, are not all these who speak Galileans? 
Acts
2:8  “And how do we hear, each one in our
own language in which we were born? 
Acts
2:9  “Parthians and Medes and Ĕylamites,
and those dwelling in Aram Naharayim, both Yehuḏah and Kappadokia, Pontos
and Asia, 
Acts
2:10  both Phrygia and Pamphulia,
Mitsrayim and the parts of Libya around Cyrene, visitors from Rome, both Yehuḏim
and converts, 
Acts
2:11  “Cretans and Araḇs, we hear
them speaking in our own tongues the great deeds of Elohim.” 
Acts
2:12  And they were all amazed, and were
puzzled, saying to each other, “What does this mean?” 
Acts
2:13  And others mocking said, “They have
been filled with sweet wine.” 
Acts
2:14  But Kĕpha, standing up with
the eleven, lifted up his voice and said to them, “Men of Yehuḏah and all
those dwelling in Yerushalayim, let this be known to you, and listen closely to
my words. 
Acts
2:15  “For these men are not drunk, as
you imagine, since it is only the third hour of the day. 
Acts
2:16  “But this is what was spoken by the
prophet Yo’ĕl: 
Acts
2:17  ‘And it shall be in the last days,
says Elohim, that I shall pour out of My Spirit on all flesh. And your sons and
your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your
old men shall dream dreams, 
Acts
2:18  and also on My male servants and on
My female servants I shall pour out My Spirit in those days, and they shall
prophesy. 
Acts
2:19  ‘And I shall show wonders in the
heaven above and signs in the earth beneath: blood and fire and vapour of
smoke. 
Acts
2:20  ‘The sun shall be turned into
darkness, and the moon into blood, before the coming of the great and splendid
day of יהוה. 
Acts
2:21  ‘And it shall be that everyone who
calls on the Name of יהוה shall be saved.’
Acts
2:22  “Men of Yisra’ĕl, hear these
words: יהושע of Natsareth, a Man from Elohim,
having been pointed out to you by mighty works, and wonders, and signs which
Elohim did through Him in your midst, as you yourselves also know, 
Acts
2:23  this One, given up by the set
purpose and foreknowledge of Elohim, you have impaled and put to death through
the hands of lawless men – 
Acts
2:24  “Him Elohim raised up, having
loosed the pangs of death, because it was impossible that He could be held in
its grip. 
Acts
2:25  “For Dawiḏ says concerning
Him, ‘I saw יהוה before me continually, because He is
at my right hand, in order that I should not be shaken. 
Acts
2:26  ‘For this reason my heart rejoiced,
and my tongue was glad, and now my flesh shall also rest in expectation, 
Acts
2:27  because You shall not leave my
being in the grave, nor shall You give Your Kind One to see corruption. 
Acts
2:28  ‘You have made known to me the ways
of life, You shall fill me with joy in Your presence.’
Acts
2:29  “Men and brothers, let me speak
boldly to you of the ancestor Dawiḏ, that he died and was buried, and his
tomb is with us to this day.
Acts
2:30  “Being a prophet, then, and knowing
that Elohim had sworn with an oath to him: of the fruit of his loins, according
to the flesh, to raise up the Messiah to sit on his throne, 
Acts
2:31  foreseeing this he spoke concerning
the resurrection of the Messiah, that His being was neither left in the grave,
nor did His flesh see corruption. 
Acts
2:32  “Elohim has raised up this יהושע,
of which we are all witnesses. 
Acts
2:33  “Therefore, having been exalted to
the right hand of Elohim, and having received from the Father the promise of
the Set-apart Spirit, He poured out this which you now see and hear. 
Acts
2:34  “For Dawiḏ did not ascend
into the heavens, but he himself said, ‘ יהוה said to
my Master, “Sit at My right hand, 
Acts
2:35  until I make Your enemies a
footstool for Your feet.” ’
Acts
2:36  “Therefore let all the house of
Yisra’ĕl know for certain that Elohim has made this יהושע,
whom you impaled, both Master and Messiah.” 
Acts
2:37  And having heard this, they were
pierced to the heart, and said to Kĕpha and the rest of the emissaries, “Men,
brothers, what shall we do?” 
Acts
2:38  And Kĕpha said to them, “Repent,
and let each one of you be immersed in the Name of יהושע
Messiah for the forgiveness of sins. And you shall receive the gift of the
Set-apart Spirit.
Acts
2:39  “For the promise is to you and to
your children, and to all who are far off, as many as יהוה
our Elohim shall call.” 
Acts
2:40  And with many other words he
earnestly witnessed and urged them, saying, “Be saved from this crooked generation.”
Acts
2:41  Then those, indeed, who gladly
received his word, were immersed. And on that day about three thousand beings
were added to them. 
Acts
2:42  And they were continuing
steadfastly in the teaching of the emissaries, and in the fellowship, and in
the breaking of bread, and in the prayers. 
Acts
2:43  And fear came upon every being, and
many wonders and signs were being done through the emissaries. 
Acts
2:44  And all those who believed were
together, and had all in common, 
Acts
2:45  and sold their possessions and
property, and divided them among all, as anyone might have need. 
Acts
2:46  And day by day, continuing with one
mind in the Set-apart Place, and breaking bread from house to house, they ate
their food with gladness and simplicity of heart, 
Acts
2:47  praising Elohim and having favour
with all the people. And the Master added to the assembly those who were being
saved, day by day. 
Acts
3:1  And Kĕpha and Yoḥanan
were going up to the Set-apart Place at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour. 
Acts
3:2  And a certain man, lame from his
birth, was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the Set-apart Place
which is called Yaphah, to ask alms from those entering into the Set-apart
Place,
Acts
3:3  who, seeing Kĕpha and
Yoḥanan about to go into the Set-apart Place, asked for alms. 
Acts
3:4  And Kĕpha, with Yoḥanan,
looking steadfastly at him, said, “Look at us.” 
Acts
3:5  And he gave heed to them, expecting
to receive whatever from them. 
Acts
3:6  But Kĕpha said, “I do not have
silver and gold, but what I do possess, this I give you: In the Name of יהושע
Messiah of Natsareth, rise up and walk.” 
Acts
3:7  And taking him by the right hand he
lifted him up, and immediately his feet and ankle bones were made firm. 
Acts
3:8  And leaping up, he stood and walked,
and went in with them into the Set-apart Place, walking and leaping and
praising Elohim. 
Acts
3:9  And all the people saw him walking
and praising Elohim. 
Acts
3:10  And they recognised him, that it
was he who sat begging alms at the Lovely Gate of the Set-apart Place. And they
were filled with wonder and amazement at what befell him. 
Acts
3:11  And as the lame man who was healed
was clinging to Kĕpha and Yoḥanan, all the people ran together to
them in the porch which is called Shelomoh’s, greatly amazed. 
Acts
3:12  And seeing it, Kĕpha responded
to the people, “Men of Yisra’ĕl, why do you marvel at this? Or why look so
intently at us, as though by our own power or reverence we have made him walk? 
Acts
3:13  “The Elohim of Aḇraham, and
of Yitsḥaq, and of Ya‛aqoḇ, the Elohim of our fathers,
esteemed His Servant יהושע, whom you delivered up
and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he had decided to release Him. 
Acts
3:14  “But you denied the Set-apart and
Righteous One, and asked that a man, a murderer, be granted you. 
Acts
3:15  “But you killed the Leader of life,
whom Elohim raised from the dead, of which we are witnesses.
Acts
3:16  “And by the belief in His Name,
this one whom you see and know, His Name made strong, and the belief which
comes through Him has given him this perfect healing before all of you. 
Acts
3:17  “And now, brothers, I know that you
did it in ignorance, as your rulers did too. 
Acts
3:18  “But this is how Elohim has filled
what He had announced beforehand through the mouth of all the prophets, that
His Messiah was to suffer. 
Acts
3:19  “Repent therefore and turn back,
for the blotting out of your sins, in order that times of refreshing might come
from the presence of the Master, 
Acts
3:20  and that He sends יהושע
Messiah, pre-appointed for you, 
Acts
3:21  whom heaven needs to receive until
the times of restoration of all matters,
of which Elohim spoke through the mouth of all His set-apart prophets since of
old. 
Acts
3:22  “For Mosheh truly said to the
fathers, ‘ יהוה your Elohim shall raise up for you a
Prophet like me from your brothers. Him you shall hear according to all matters, whatever He says to you. 
Acts
3:23  ‘And it shall be that every being
who does not hear that Prophet shall be utterly destroyed from among the
people.’
Acts
3:24  “And likewise, all the prophets who
have spoken, from Shemu’ĕl and those following, have also announced these
days. 
Acts
3:25  “You are sons of the prophets, and
of the covenant which Elohim made with our fathers, saying to Aḇraham, ‘And
in your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed.’ 
Acts
3:26  “To you first, Elohim, having
raised up His Servant יהושע, sent Him to bless
you, in turning away each one of you from your wicked ways.”
Acts
4:1  And as they were speaking to the
people, the priests and the captain of the Set-apart Place, and the Sadducees,
came upon them, 
Acts
4:2  being annoyed because they taught
the people and announced the resurrection from the dead in יהושע.

Acts
4:3  And they arrested them, and put them
in jail until the next day, for it was already evening. 
Acts
4:4  But many of those who had heard the
word believed, and the number of the men became about five thousand. 
Acts
4:5  And it came to be, on the next day,
that their rulers and elders and scribes assembled in Yerushalayim, 
Acts
4:6  as well as Ḥanan the high
priest, and Qayapha, and Yoḥanan, and Alexander, and as many as were of
high priestly descent. 
Acts
4:7  And having placed them in the
middle, they asked, “By what power or in what Name did you do this?” 
Acts
4:8  Then Kĕpha, filled with the
Set-apart Spirit, said to them, “Rulers of the people and elders of Yisra’ĕl:

Acts
4:9  “If today we are called to account
for a good deed towards a sick man, by whom he has been healed, 
Acts
4:10  let it be known to all of you, and
to all the people of Yisra’ĕl, that in the Name of יהושע
Messiah of Natsareth, whom you impaled, whom Elohim raised from the dead, by
Him this one stands before you, healthy. 
Acts
4:11  “This is ‘the stone which was
rejected by you builders, which has become the chief cornerstone.’ 
Acts
4:12  “And there is no deliverance in
anyone else, for there is no other Name under the heaven given among men by
which we need to be saved.” 
Acts
4:13  And seeing the boldness of Kĕpha
and Yoḥanan, and perceiving that they were unlearned and ordinary men,
they marvelled. And they recognised that they had been with יהושע.

Acts
4:14  And seeing the man who had been
healed standing with them, they could not contradict it. 
Acts
4:15  But when they had commanded them to
go aside out of the council, they consulted with one another, 
Acts
4:16  saying, “What shall we do to these
men? For, indeed, that an outstanding miracle has been done through them is
apparent to all those dwelling in Yerushalayim, and we are unable to deny it. 
Acts
4:17  “But in order that it spreads no
further among the people, let us strongly threaten them, to speak no more to
anyone in this Name.” 
Acts
4:18  And they called them and commanded
them not to speak at all nor to teach in the Name of יהושע.

Acts
4:19  But Kĕpha and Yoḥanan
answering them, said, “Whether it is right in the sight of Elohim to listen to
you more than to Elohim, you judge.
Acts
4:20  “For it is impossible for us not to
speak of what we saw and heard.” 
Acts
4:21  And having threatened them further,
they released them, finding no way of punishing them, because of the people,
because they were all praising Elohim for what had been done. 
Acts
4:22  For the man was over forty years
old on whom this miracle of healing had been done. 
Acts
4:23  And having been released, they went
to their own people and reported all
that the chief priests and elders said to them. 
Acts
4:24  And having heard that, they lifted
up their voice to Elohim with one mind and said, “ יהוה,
You are Elohim, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all that is
in them, 
Acts
4:25  who by the mouth of Your servant
Dawiḏ have said, ‘Why did the gentiles rage, and the people plot in vain?

Acts
4:26  ‘The sovereigns of the earth stood
up, and the rulers were gathered together against יהוה
and against His Messiah.’
Acts
4:27  “For truly, in this city there were
gathered together against Your set-apart Servant יהושע,
whom You anointed, both Herodes and Pontius Pilate, with the gentiles and the
people of Yisra’ĕl 
Acts
4:28  to do whatever Your hand and Your
purpose decided before to be done. 
Acts
4:29  “And now, יהוה,
look on their threats, and give to Your servants all boldness to speak Your
word, 
Acts
4:30  by stretching out Your hand for
healing, and signs, and wonders to take place through the Name of Your
set-apart Servant יהושע.” 
Acts
4:31  And when they had prayed, the place
where they came together was shaken. And they were all filled with the
Set-apart Spirit, and they spoke the word of Elohim with boldness. 
Acts
4:32  And the group of those who believed
were of one heart and one being. And no one claimed that any of his possessions
was his own, but they had all in common. 
Acts
4:33  And with great power the emissaries
gave witness to the resurrection of the Master יהושע,
and great favour was upon them all. 
Acts
4:34  For there was not anyone needy
among them, for all who were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought
the prices of what was sold, 
Acts
4:35  and laid them at the feet of the
emissaries, and they distributed to each as anyone had need. 
Acts
4:36  And Yosĕph, who was also
called Barnaḇah by the emissaries (which means Son of Encouragement), a Lĕwite,
a native of Cyprus, 
Acts
4:37  having land, sold it, and brought
the proceeds and laid it at the feet of the emissaries. 
Acts
5:1  But a certain man named Ḥananyah,
with Shappirah his wife, sold a possession. 
Acts
5:2  And he kept back from the price, his
wife also being aware of it, and brought a certain part and laid it at the feet
of the emissaries. 
Acts
5:3  But Kĕpha said, “Ḥananyah,
why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Set-apart Spirit and keep back
from the price of the land for yourself? 
Acts
5:4  “While it remained, did it not
remain your own? And after it was sold, was it not in your authority? Why have
you conceived this deed in your heart? You have not lied to men but to Elohim.”

Acts
5:5  Then Ḥananyah, hearing these
words, fell down and breathed his last. And great fear came upon all those who
heard of this. 
Acts
5:6  But the young men arose and wrapped
him up, carried him out and buried him. 
Acts
5:7  And it came to be, about three hours
later, that his wife came in, not knowing what had taken place. 
Acts
5:8  And Kĕpha responded to her, “Say
to me whether you sold the land for so much?” And she said, “Yes, for so much.”

Acts
5:9  So Kĕpha said to her, “Why have
you agreed to try the Spirit of יהוה ? Look, the feet
of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they shall carry you
out.” 
Acts
5:10  And immediately she fell down at
his feet and breathed her last. And the young men came in and found her dead,
and carrying her out, they buried her beside her husband. 
Acts
5:11  And great fear came upon all the
assembly and upon all who heard of this. 
Acts
5:12  And through the hands of the
emissaries many signs and wonders were done among the people. And they were all
with one mind in Shelomoh’s Porch. 
Acts
5:13  But of the rest no one had the
courage to join them, however, the people made much of them. 
Acts
5:14  And more believers were added to
the Master, large numbers of both men and women, 
Acts
5:15  so that they brought the sick out
into the streets and laid them on beds and couches, that at least the shadow of
Kĕpha, passing by, might fall on some of them. 
Acts
5:16  A large number also gathered from
the surrounding cities to Yerushalayim, bringing sick ones and those who were
troubled by unclean spirits, and they were all healed. 
Acts
5:17  But the high priest rose up, and
all those with him, which is the sect of the Sadducees, and they were filled
with jealousy, 
Acts
5:18  and seized the emissaries and put
them in the public jail. 
Acts
5:19  But a messenger of יהוה
opened the prison doors at night and brought them out, and said, 
Acts
5:20  “Go and stand in the Set-apart
Place and speak to the people all the words of this life.” 
Acts
5:21  Now when they heard, they went into
the Set-apart Place early in the morning, and were teaching. But the high
priest and those with him came and called the council together, with all the
elders of the children of Yisra’ĕl, and sent to the prison for them to be
brought. 
Acts
5:22  But having come, the officers did
not find them in the prison, and they went back and reported it, 
Acts
5:23  saying, “We found the prison shut
in all safety, and the watches standing outside before the doors. But having
opened them, we found no one inside!” 
Acts
5:24  And as the high priest and the
captain of the Set-apart Place and the chief priests heard these words, they
were puzzled and wondered what this might be. 
Acts
5:25  But one came and reported to them,
saying, “Look, the men whom you put in prison are standing in the Set-apart
Place and teaching the people!” 
Acts
5:26  Then the captain went with the
officers and brought them, not with force, for they feared the people, lest
they should be stoned. 
Acts
5:27  And having brought them, they set
them before the council and the high priest asked them, 
Acts
5:28  saying, “Did we not strictly
command you not to teach in this Name? And look, you have filled Yerushalayim
with your teaching, and intend to bring the blood of this Man upon us!” 
Acts
5:29  And Kĕpha and the other
emissaries answering, said, “We have to obey Elohim rather than men.
Acts
5:30  “The Elohim of our fathers raised
up יהושע whom you laid hands on, hanging Him on a timber. 
Acts
5:31  “Him, a Prince and a Saviour,
Elohim has exalted to His right hand, to give repentance to Yisra’ĕl and
forgiveness of sins. 
Acts
5:32  “And we are His witnesses to these
matters, and so also is the Set-apart Spirit whom Elohim has given to those who
obey Him.”
Acts
5:33  And those hearing were cut to the heart, and took counsel to kill
them. 
Acts
5:34  But a certain one in the council
stood up, a Pharisee named Gamli’ĕl, a teacher of the Torah, respected by
all the people, and ordered them to put the emissaries outside for a little
while, 
Acts
5:35  and said to them, “Men of Yisra’ĕl,
take heed to yourselves what you intend to do to these men. 
Acts
5:36  “For before these days Toḏah
rose up, claiming to be somebody. A number of men, about four hundred, did join
him. He was slain, and all who obeyed him were dispersed, and came to naught. 
Acts
5:37  “After him, Yehuḏah of Galil
rose up in the days of the census, and drew away many people after him. He also
perished, and all who obeyed him were scattered. 
Acts
5:38  “And now I say to you, stay away
from these men and leave them alone, because if this plan or this work is of
men, it shall be overthrown, 
Acts
5:39  but if it is of Elohim, you are
unable to overthrow it, lest you even be found to fight against Elohim.” 
Acts
5:40  And they heeded his advice, and
having called for the emissaries, beating them, they commanded that they should
not speak in the Name of יהושע, and let them go. 
Acts
5:41  Then indeed they went rejoicing
from the presence of the council, because they were counted worthy to suffer
shame for His Name. 
Acts
5:42  And daily in the Set-apart Place,
and in every house, they did not cease teaching and bringing the Good News: יהושע
the Messiah! 
Acts
6:1  And in those days, when the taught
ones were increasing, there arose a grumbling against the Heḇrews by the
Hellenists, because their widows were overlooked in the daily serving. 
Acts
6:2  So the twelve summoned the group of
the taught ones and said, “It is not pleasing for us to leave the Word of
Elohim and serve tables. 
Acts
6:3  “Therefore, brothers, seek out from
among you seven men who are known to be filled with the Set-apart Spirit and
wisdom, whom we shall appoint for this duty, 
Acts
6:4  but we shall give ourselves
continually to prayer and to serving the Word.” 
Acts
6:5  And the word pleased the entire
group. And they chose Stephanos, a man filled with belief and the Set-apart
Spirit, and Philip, and Prochoros, and Nikanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and
Nikolaos, a convert from Antioch, 
Acts
6:6  whom they set before the emissaries.
And when they had prayed, they laid hands on them. 
Acts
6:7  And the Word of Elohim spread, and
the number of the taught ones increased greatly in Yerushalayim, and a great
many of the priests were obedient to the belief. 
Acts
6:8  And Stephanos, filled with belief
and power, did great wonders and signs among the people. 
Acts
6:9  But some of those of the so-called
Congregation of the Freedmen (Cyrenians, Alexandrians, and those from Kilikia
and Asia), rose up, disputing with Stephanos, 
Acts
6:10  but they were unable to resist the
wisdom and the Spirit by which he spoke. 
Acts
6:11  Then they instigated men to say, “We
have heard him speak blasphemous words against Mosheh and Elohim.” 
Acts
6:12  And they stirred up the people, and
the elders, and the scribes, so they came upon him, seized him, and brought him
to the council. 
Acts
6:13  And they set up false witnesses who
said, “This man does not cease to speak blasphemous words against this
set-apart place and the Torah, 
Acts
6:14  for we have heard him saying that
this יהושע of Natsareth shall overthrow this
place and change the institutes which Mosheh delivered unto us.” 
Acts
6:15  And all who sat in the council,
looking steadily at him, saw his face was like the face of a heavenly messenger. 
Acts
7:1  And the high priest said, “Is this
so?” 
Acts
7:2  And he replied, “Men, brothers and
fathers, listen: The Elohim of esteem appeared to our father Aḇraham when
he was in Aram Naharayim, before he dwelt in Ḥaran, 
Acts
7:3  and said to him, ‘Come out of your
land and from your relatives, and come here, into a land that I shall show you.’

Acts
7:4  “Then he came out of the land of the
Chaldeans and dwelt in Ḥaran. And from there, after the death of his
father, He removed him to this land in which you now dwell. 
Acts
7:5  “And He gave him no inheritance in
it, not a foot of it. But He promised to give it to him for a possession, and
to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child. 
Acts
7:6  “And Elohim spoke in this way: that
his seed would be sojourning in a foreign land, and that they would be enslaved
and mistreated four hundred years. 
Acts
7:7  ‘And the nation to whom they shall
be enslaved, I shall judge,’ said Elohim, ‘and after that they shall come out
and serve Me in this place.’ 
Acts
7:8  “And He gave him the covenant of
circumcision. And so he brought forth
Yitsḥaq and circumcised him on the eighth day. And Yitsḥaq brought
forth Ya‛aqoḇ, and Ya‛aqoḇ brought forth the twelve ancestors. 
Acts
7:9  “And the ancestors, becoming
jealous, sold Yosĕph into Mitsrayim. But Elohim was with him, 
Acts
7:10  and delivered him out of all his
afflictions, and gave him favour and wisdom before Pharaoh, sovereign of
Mitsrayim. And he appointed him governor over Mitsrayim and all his house. 
Acts
7:11  “Then a scarcity of food and great
distress came over all the land of Mitsrayim and Kena‘an, and our fathers found
no food. 
Acts
7:12  “But Ya‛aqoḇ heard that
there was grain in Mitsrayim, and he sent out our fathers the first time, 
Acts
7:13  and at the second time Yosĕph
was made known to his brothers, and Yosĕph’s race became known to the
Pharaoh. 
Acts
7:14  “And Yosĕph sent and called
his father Ya‛aqoḇ and all his relatives to him, seventy-five
people. 
Acts
7:15  “And Ya‛aqoḇ went down
to Mitsrayim, and died, he and our fathers, 
Acts
7:16  and they were brought over to Sheḵem
and laid in the tomb that Aḇraham bought for a price of silver from the
sons of Ḥamor, the father of
Sheḵem. 
Acts
7:17  “But as the time of the promise
drew near which Elohim had sworn to Aḇraham, the people increased and
multiplied in Mitsrayim 
Acts
7:18  until another sovereign arose who
did not know Yosĕph. 
Acts
7:19  “Having dealt treacherously with
our race, this one mistreated our fathers, making them expose their babies, so
that they should not live. 
Acts
7:20  “At that time Mosheh was born, and
he was well-pleasing to Elohim. And he was reared three months in the house of
his father. 
Acts
7:21  “But when he was exposed, the
daughter of Pharaoh took him up and reared him as her own son. 
Acts
7:22  “And Mosheh was instructed in all
the wisdom of the Mitsrites, and was mighty in words and works. 
Acts
7:23  “And when he was forty years old,
it came into his heart to visit his brothers, the children of Yisra’ĕl. 
Acts
7:24  “And seeing one of them being
wronged, he defended and revenged him who was oppressed, smiting the Mitsrite. 
Acts
7:25  “And he thought that his brothers
would have understood that Elohim would give deliverance to them by his hand,
but they did not understand. 
Acts
7:26  “And the next day he appeared to
two of them as they were fighting, and urged them to peace, saying, ‘Men, you
are brothers, why do you wrong one another?’ 
Acts
7:27  “But he who was wronging his
neighbour pushed him away, saying, ‘Who made you a ruler and a judge over us? 
Acts
7:28  ‘Do you wish to kill me as you
killed the Mitsrite yesterday?’ 
Acts
7:29  “And at this saying, Mosheh fled
and became a sojourner in the land of Miḏyan, where he fathered two sons.

Acts
7:30  “And after forty years were
completed, a Messenger of יהוה appeared to him in a
flame of fire in a bush, in the wilderness of Mount Sinai. 
Acts
7:31  “And Mosheh, seeing it, marvelled
at the sight, and coming near to look, the voice of יהוה
came to him, 
Acts
7:32  saying, ‘I am the Elohim of your
fathers, the Elohim of Aḇraham and the Elohim of Yitsḥaq and the
Elohim of Ya‛aqoḇ.’ And Mosheh trembled and did not have the
courage to look. 
Acts
7:33  ‘But יהוה
said to him, “Take your sandals off your feet, for the place where you stand is
set-apart ground. 
Acts
7:34  “I have certainly seen the evil
treatment of my people who are in Mitsrayim, and I have heard their groaning
and have come down to deliver them. And now come, let Me send you to Mitsrayim.”
’ 
Acts
7:35  “This Mosheh whom they had refused,
saying, ‘Who made you a ruler and a judge?’ – this one Elohim sent to be a
ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the Messenger who appeared to him in the
bush. 
Acts
7:36  “This one led them out, after he
had done wonders and signs in the land of Mitsrayim, and in the Red Sea, and in
the wilderness forty years. 
Acts
7:37  “This is the Mosheh who said to the
children of Yisra’ĕl, ‘ יהוה your Elohim shall
raise up for you a Prophet like me from your brothers. Him you shall hear.’ 
Acts
7:38  “This is he who was in the assembly
in the wilderness with the Messenger who spoke to him on Mount Sinai, and with
our fathers, who received the living Words to give to us, 
Acts
7:39  unto whom our fathers would not
become obedient, but thrust away, and in their hearts they turned back to
Mits-rayim, 
Acts
7:40  saying to Aharon, ‘Make us mighty
ones to go before us, for this Mosheh who led us out of the land of Mitsrayim,
we do not know what has become of him.’ 
Acts
7:41  “And they made a calf in those
days, and brought an offering to the idol, and were rejoicing in the works of
their own hands. 
Acts
7:42  “So Elohim turned and gave them up
to worship the host of the heaven, as it has been written in the book of the
Prophets, ‘Did you bring slaughtered beasts and offerings unto Me during forty
years in the wilderness, O house of Yisra’ĕl? 
Acts
7:43  ‘And you took up the tent of Moleḵ,
and the star of your mighty one Kiyyun, images which you made to bow before
them. Therefore I shall remove you beyond Baḇel.’ 
Acts
7:44  “The Tent of Witness was with our
fathers in the wilderness, as He appointed, instructing Mosheh to make it
according to the pattern that he had seen, 
Acts
7:45  which our fathers, having received
it in turn, also brought with Yehoshua into the land possessed by the gentiles,
whom Elohim drove out before the face of our fathers until the days of Dawiḏ,

Acts
7:46  who found favour before Elohim and
asked to find a dwelling for the Elohim of Ya‛aqoḇ, 
Acts
7:47  but Shelomoh built Him a house. 
Acts
7:48  “However, the Most High does not
dwell in dwellings made with hands, as the prophet says:
Acts
7:49  ‘The heaven is My throne, and earth
is My footstool. What house shall you build for Me? says יהוה,
or what is the place of My rest? 
Acts
7:50  ‘Has My hand not made all these?’ 
Acts
7:51  “You stiff-necked and uncircumcised
in heart and ears! You always resist the Set-apart Spirit, as your fathers did,
you also do. 
Acts
7:52  “Which of the prophets did your
fathers not persecute? And they killed those who before announced the coming of
the Righteous One, of whom you now have become the betrayers and murderers, 
Acts
7:53  who received the Torah as it was
ordained by messengers, but did not watch over it.”
Acts
7:54  And hearing this they were cut to
the hearts and gnashed the teeth at him. 
Acts
7:55  But he, being filled with the
Set-apart Spirit, looked steadily into the heaven and saw the esteem of Elohim,
and יהושע standing at the right hand of Elohim, 
Acts
7:56  and he said, “Look! I see the
heavens opened and the Son of Aḏam standing at the right hand of Elohim!”

Acts
7:57  And crying out with a loud voice,
they stopped their ears, and rushed upon him with one mind, 
Acts
7:58  and threw him out of the city and
stoned him. And the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young
man named Sha’ul. 
Acts
7:59  And they were stoning Stephanos as
he was calling and saying, “Master יהושע, receive
my spirit.” 
Acts
7:60  And kneeling down he cried out with
a loud voice, “Master, do not hold this sin against them.” And having said
this, he fell asleep. 
Acts
8:1  And Sha’ul was giving approval to
his death. And on that day there was a great persecution against the assembly
which was at Yerushalayim, and they were all scattered throughout the countries
of Yehuḏah and Shomeron, except the emissaries. 
Acts
8:2  And dedicated men buried Stephanos,
and made great lamentation over him. 
Acts
8:3  But Sha’ul was ravaging the assembly,
entering every house, and dragging off men and women, putting them in prison. 
Acts
8:4  Then those who had been scattered
went everywhere bringing the Good News: the Word! 
Acts
8:5  And going down to the city of
Shomeron Philip proclaimed Messiah to them. 
Acts
8:6  And the crowds with one mind heeded
what Philip said, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did. 
Acts
8:7  For unclean spirits came out of many
who were possessed, crying with a loud voice, and many who were paralysed and
lame were healed. 
Acts
8:8  And there came to be great joy in
that city. 
Acts
8:9  Now there was a certain man called
Shim‛on, who formerly was practising magic in the city and astonishing
the people of Shomeron, claiming to be someone great, 
Acts
8:10  to whom they all were giving heed,
from the least to the greatest, saying, “This one is the power of Elohim, which
is great.” 
Acts
8:11  And they were giving heed to him
because for a long time he had amazed them with his magic. 
Acts
8:12  And when they believed Philip as he
brought the Good News about the reign of Elohim and the Name of יהושע
Messiah, both men and women were immersed. 
Acts
8:13  And Shim‛on himself also
believed. And when he was immersed he continued with Philip, and was amazed,
seeing the miracles and signs which took place. 
Acts
8:14  And when the emissaries who were at
Yerushalayim heard that Shomeron had received the Word of Elohim, they sent Kĕpha
and Yoḥanan to them, 
Acts
8:15  who, when they had come down,
prayed for them to receive the Set-apart Spirit, 
Acts
8:16  for He had not yet fallen on any of
them, but they had only been immersed in the Name of the Master יהושע.

Acts
8:17  Then they laid hands on them, and
they received the Set-apart Spirit. 
Acts
8:18  And Shim‛on, seeing that through
the laying on of the hands of the emissaries the Set-apart Spirit was given, he
offered them money, 
Acts
8:19  saying, “Give me this authority
too, so that anyone I lay hands on shall receive the Set-apart Spirit.” 
Acts
8:20  But Kĕpha said to him, “Let
your silver perish with you, because you thought to buy the gift of Elohim
through money! 
Acts
8:21  “You have neither part nor lot in
this matter, for your heart is not right before Elohim. 
Acts
8:22  “Repent therefore of this evil of
yours, and plead with Elohim to forgive you the intention of your heart. 
Acts
8:23  “For I see that you are poisoned by
bitterness and bound by unrighteousness.” 
Acts
8:24  But Shim‛on answering, said, “Plead
with the Master for me, so that none of what you had said shall come upon me.” 
Acts
8:25  Then after they had earnestly
witnessed and spoken the Word of יהוה, they returned to
Yerushalayim, bringing the Good News in many villages of the Shomeronites. 
Acts
8:26  But a messenger of יהוה
spoke to Philip, saying, “Arise and go toward the south along the way which
goes down from Yerushalayim to Azzah.” This is desert. 
Acts
8:27  And he arose and went, and saw, a
man of Kush, a eunuch of great authority under Kandake the sovereigness of the
Kushites, who was in charge of all her treasury, and had come to Yerushalayim
to worship, 
Acts
8:28  and was returning. And sitting in
his chariot, he was reading the prophet Yeshayahu. 
Acts
8:29  And the Spirit said to Philip, “Go
near and join him in that chariot.” 
Acts
8:30  And running up, Philip heard him
reading the prophet Yeshayahu, and said, “Do you know what you are reading?” 
Acts
8:31  And he said, “How am I able, unless
someone guides me?” And he called Philip near, to come up and sit with him. 
Acts
8:32  And the passage of the Scripture
which he was reading was this, “He was led as a sheep to slaughter, and like a
lamb silent before its shearer, so He opened not His mouth. 
Acts
8:33  “In His humiliation He was deprived
of right-ruling. And who shall declare His generation? Because His life was
taken from the earth.”
Acts
8:34  And the eunuch, answering Philip,
said, “I ask you, about whom does the prophet say this, about himself or about
some other?” 
Acts
8:35  And Philip opening his mouth, and
beginning at this Scripture, brought to him the Good News: יהושע
! 
Acts
8:36  And as they were going on the way,
they came to some water. And the eunuch said, “Look, water! What hinders me
from being immersed?” 
Acts
8:37  And Philip said, “If you believe
with all your heart, it is permitted.” And he answering, said, “I believe that יהושע
Messiah is the Son of Elohim.”
Acts
8:38  And he commanded the chariot to
stand still. And both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water, and he
immersed him. 
Acts
8:39  And when they came up out of the
water, the Spirit of יהוה caught Philip away, and the
eunuch saw him no more, for he went his way, rejoicing. 
Acts
8:40  Philip, however, was found at Ashdoḏ.
And passing through, he brought the Good News in all the cities until he came
to Caesarea. 
Acts
9:1  But Sha’ul, still breathing threats
and murder against the taught ones of the Master, having come to the high
priest, 
Acts
9:2  asked from him letters to the
congregations of Damascus, so that if he found any who were of the Way, whether
men or women, to bring them bound to Yerushalayim. 
Acts
9:3  And it came to be, that as he
journeyed, he came near Damascus, and suddenly a light flashed around him from
the heaven. 
Acts
9:4  And he fell to the ground, and heard
a voice saying to him, “Sha’ul, Sha’ul, why do you persecute Me?” 
Acts
9:5  And he said, “Who are You, Master?”
And the Master said, “I am יהושע, whom you
persecute. It is hard for you to kick against the prods.” 
Acts
9:6  Both trembling, and being
astonished, he said, “Master, what do You wish me to do?” And the Master said to him, “Arise and go into the
city, and you shall be told what you have to do.” 
Acts
9:7  And the men journeying with him
stood speechless, hearing indeed the voice but seeing no one. 
Acts
9:8  And Sha’ul arose from the ground,
but when his eyes were opened he saw no one. And leading him by the hand they
brought him into Damascus. 
Acts
9:9  And he was three days without sight,
and did not eat nor drink. 
Acts
9:10  And there was at Damascus a certain
taught one, by name Ḥananyah. And the Master said unto him in a vision, “Ḥananyah!”
And he said, “Here I am, Master.”
Acts
9:11  And the Master said to him, “Arise and go to the street called Straight, and seek
in the house of Yehuḏah for one called Sha’ul of Tarsos, for look, he is
praying, 
Acts
9:12  and has seen in a vision a man
named Ḥananyah coming in and laying his hand on him, so as to see again.”

Acts
9:13  And Ḥananyah answered, “Master,
I have heard from many about this man, how many evils he did to Your set-apart
ones in Yerushalayim, 
Acts
9:14  and here he has authority from the
chief priests to bind all those calling on Your Name.” 
Acts
9:15  But the Master said to him, “Go,
for he is a chosen vessel of Mine to bear My Name before nations, sovereigns,
and the children of Yisra’ĕl. 
Acts
9:16  “For I shall show him how much he
has to suffer for My Name.” 
Acts
9:17  And Ḥananyah went away and
went into the house. And laying his hands on him he said, “Brother Sha’ul, the
Master יהושע, who appeared to you on the way as
you came, has sent me, so that you might see again and be filled with the
Set-apart Spirit.” 
Acts
9:18  And immediately there fell from his
eyes, as it were scales, and he received his sight. And rising up, he was
immersed. 
Acts
9:19  And having received food, he was
strengthened. And Sha’ul was with the taught ones at Damascus some days. 
Acts
9:20  And immediately he proclaimed the
Messiah in the congregations, that He is the Son of Elohim. 
Acts
9:21  And all who heard were amazed, and
said, “Is this not he who destroyed those calling on this Name in Yerushalayim,
and has come here for this, to take them bound to the chief priests?” 
Acts
9:22  But Sha’ul kept increasing in
strength, and was confounding the Yehuḏim who dwelt in Damascus, proving
that this is the Messiah. 
Acts
9:23  And after many days had elapsed,
the Yehuḏim plotted to kill him. 
Acts
9:24  But their plot became known to Sha’ul.
And they were watching the gates day and night, to kill him. 
Acts
9:25  But taking him by night, the taught
ones let him down through the wall, lowering him in a basket. 
Acts
9:26  And having arrived at Yerushalayim,
Sha’ul tried to join the taught ones, but they were all afraid of him, not
believing that he was a taught one. 
Acts
9:27  But Barnaḇah took him and
brought him to the emissaries, and told them how he had seen the Master on the
way, and that He had spoken to him, and how he was speaking boldly at Damascus
in the Name of יהושע. 
Acts
9:28  And he was with them at
Yerushalayim, coming in and going out, 
Acts
9:29  and speaking boldly in the Name of
the Master יהושע and disputed with the
Hellenists, but they undertook to kill him. 
Acts
9:30  And when the brothers learned of
this, they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him out to Tarsos. 
Acts
9:31  Then indeed the assemblies
throughout all Yehuḏah, and Galil, and Shomeron had peace and were built
up, and walking in the fear of יהוה and in the
encouragement of the Set-apart Spirit, they were being increased. 
Acts
9:32  And it came to be, as Kĕpha
was passing through all places, that
he also came down to the set-apart ones who were dwelling at Lod. 
Acts
9:33  And there he found a certain man
named Aeneas, who had been bedridden for eight years, being paralytic. 
Acts
9:34  And Kĕpha said to him, “Aeneas,
יהושע the Messiah heals you! Rise up and make
your bed.” And immediately he rose up. 
Acts
9:35  And all those dwelling at Lod and
Sharon saw him and did turn to the Master. 
Acts
9:36  And in Yapho there was a certain
taught one named Taḇitha, which means Dorkas. This woman was filled with
good works and kind deeds which she did. 
Acts
9:37  And it came to be in those days
that she became sick and died. And having washed her, they laid her in an upper
room. 
Acts
9:38  And Lod being near to Yapho, and
the taught ones having heard that Kĕpha was there, they sent two men to
him, urging him not to delay in coming to them. 
Acts
9:39  And having risen up, Kĕpha
went with them. And when he arrived, they brought him to the upper room. And
all the widows stood beside him weeping, showing the inner garments and outer
garments which Dorkas had made while she was with them. 
Acts
9:40  But Kĕpha sent them all out,
and knelt down and prayed. And turning to the body he said, “Taḇitha,
arise.” And she opened her eyes, and seeing Kĕpha, she sat up. 
Acts
9:41  And giving her his hand, he lifted
her up. And calling the set-apart ones and widows, he presented her alive. 
Acts
9:42  And it became known throughout all
Yapho, and many believed on the Master. 
Acts
9:43  And it came to be that he stayed
for many days in Yapho with Shim‛on, a leather-tanner. 
Acts
10:1  Now there was a certain man in Caesarea
called Cornelius, a captain of what was called the Italian Regiment, 
Acts
10:2  dedicated, and fearing Elohim with
all his household, doing many kind deeds to the people, and praying to Elohim
always. 
Acts
10:3  He clearly saw in a vision, about the
ninth hour of the day, a messenger of Elohim coming to him, and saying to him, “Cornelius!”

Acts
10:4  And looking intently at him, and
becoming afraid, he said, “What is it, master?” And he said to him, “Your
prayers and your kind deeds have come up for a remembrance before Elohim. 
Acts
10:5  “And now send men to Yapho, and
send for Shim‛on who is also called Kĕpha. 
Acts
10:6  “He is staying with Shim‛on,
a leather-tanner, whose house is by the sea.” 
Acts
10:7  And when the messenger who spoke to
him went away, Cornelius called two of his household servants, and a dedicated
soldier from among those who waited on him continually. 
Acts
10:8  And having explained to them all,
he sent them to Yapho. 
Acts
10:9  And on the next day, as they were
on their way and approaching the city, Kĕpha went up on the house-top to
pray, about the sixth hour. 
Acts
10:10  And he became hungry and wished to
eat. But while they were preparing, he fell into a trance, 
Acts
10:11  and he saw the heaven opened and a
certain vessel like a great sheet bound at the four corners, descending to him
and let down to the earth, 
Acts
10:12  in which were all kinds of
four-footed beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping creatures, and the birds of the heaven. 
Acts
10:13  And a voice came to him, “Rise up,
Kĕpha, slay and eat.” 
Acts
10:14  But Kĕpha said, “Not at all,
Master! Because I have never eaten whatever is common or unclean.” 
Acts
10:15  And a voice came to him again the second time, “What Elohim has cleansed you do
not consider common.” 
Acts
10:16  And this took place three times,
and the vessel was taken back to the heaven. 
Acts
10:17  And while Kĕpha was doubting
within himself about what the vision might mean, look, the men who had been
sent from Cornelius, having asked for the house of Shim‛on, stood at the
gate, 
Acts
10:18  and calling out, they enquired
whether Shim‛on, also known as Kĕpha, was staying there. 
Acts
10:19  And as Kĕpha was thinking
about the vision, the Spirit said to him, “See, three men seek you. 
Acts
10:20  “But rise up, go down and go with
them, not doubting at all, for I have sent them.” 
Acts
10:21  So Kĕpha went down to the men
who had been sent to him from Cornelius, and said, “Look, I am the one you
seek. Why have you come?” 
Acts
10:22  And they said, “Cornelius the
captain, a righteous man and one who fears Elohim and well spoken of by the
entire nation of the Yehuḏim, was instructed by a set-apart messenger to
send for you to his house, and to hear words from you.” 
Acts
10:23  So inviting them in, he housed
them. And on the next day Kĕpha went away with them, and some brothers
from Yapho went with him. 
Acts
10:24  And the following day they entered
into Caesarea. And Cornelius was waiting for them, having called together his
relatives and close friends. 
Acts
10:25  And it came to be, that when Kĕpha
entered, Cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and bowed before him. 
Acts
10:26  But Kĕpha raised him up,
saying, “Stand up, I myself am also a man.” 
Acts
10:27  And talking with him, he went in
and found many who had come together. 
Acts
10:28  And he said to them, “You know
that a Yehuḏite man is not allowed to associate with, or go to one of
another race. But Elohim has shown me that I should not call any man common or
unclean.
Acts
10:29  “That is why I came without
hesitation when I was sent for. So I ask, why have you sent for me?” 
Acts
10:30  And Cornelius said, “Four days ago
I was fasting until this hour. And at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and
see, a man stood before me in shining garments, 
Acts
10:31  and said, ‘Cornelius, your prayer
has been heard, and your kind deeds were remembered before Elohim. 
Acts
10:32  ‘Now send to Yapho and call Shim‛on
here, who is also called Kĕpha. He is staying in the house of Shim‛on,
a leather-tanner, by the sea. When he comes, he shall speak to you.’ 
Acts
10:33  “So I sent to you immediately, and
you have done well to come. And now, we are all present before Elohim, to hear
all that you have been commanded by Elohim.” 
Acts
10:34  And opening his mouth, Kĕpha
said, “Truly I see that Elohim shows no partiality, 
Acts
10:35  but in every nation, he who fears
Him and works righteousness is accepted by Him. 
Acts
10:36  “He sent the word to the children
of Yisra’ĕl, bringing the Good News: peace through יהושע
Messiah! He is Master of all. 
Acts
10:37  “You know what word came to be
throughout all Yehuḏah, beginning from Galil after the immersion which
Yoḥanan proclaimed: 
Acts
10:38  how Elohim did anoint יהושע
of Natsareth with the Set-apart Spirit and with power, who went about doing
good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for Elohim was with Him. 
Acts
10:39  “And we are witnesses of all He
did, both in the country of the Yehuḏim and in Yerushalayim, whom they
even killed by hanging on a timber. 
Acts
10:40  “Elohim raised up this One on the
third day, and let Him be seen, 
Acts
10:41  not to all the people, but to
witnesses, those having been chosen before by Elohim – to us who ate and drank
with Him after He arose from the dead. 
Acts
10:42  “And He commanded us to proclaim
to the people, and to witness that it is He who was appointed by Elohim to be
Judge of the living and the dead.
Acts
10:43  “To this One all the prophets bear
witness, that through His Name, everyone believing in Him does receive
forgiveness of sins.” 
Acts
10:44  While Kĕpha was still
speaking these words, the Set-apart Spirit fell upon all those hearing the
word. 
Acts
10:45  And those of the circumcision who
believed were astonished, as many as came with Kĕpha, because the gift of
the Set-apart Spirit had been poured out on the gentiles also, 
Acts
10:46  for they were hearing them
speaking with tongues and extolling Elohim. Then Kĕpha answered, 
Acts
10:47  “Is anyone able to forbid water,
that these should not be immersed who have received the Set-apart Spirit – even
as also we?” 
Acts
10:48  And he commanded them to be
immersed in the Name of יהושע Messiah. Then they
asked him to remain a few days. 
Acts
11:1  And the emissaries and brothers who
were in Yehuḏah heard that the gentiles also received the word of Elohim.

Acts
11:2  And when Kĕpha went up to
Yerushalayim, those of the circumcision were contending with him, 
Acts
11:3  saying, “You went in to
uncircumcised men and ate with them!” 
Acts
11:4  But Kĕpha began and set it
forth in order, saying: 
Acts
11:5  “I was in the city of Yapho
praying. And in a trance I saw a vision, a certain vessel descending like a
great sheet, let down from the heaven by four corners, and it came to me. 
Acts
11:6  “Having looked into it, I perceived
and I saw four-footed beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping creatures, and the birds of heaven. 
Acts
11:7  “And I heard a voice saying to me, ‘Rise
up, Kĕpha, slay and eat.’ 
Acts
11:8  “But I said, ‘Not at all, Master!
Because whatever is common or unclean has never entered into my mouth.’ 
Acts
11:9  “And the voice answered me again
from the heaven, ‘What Elohim has cleansed you do not consider common.’ 
Acts
11:10  “And this took place three times,
and all were drawn up again into the heaven. 
Acts
11:11  “And see, immediately three men
stood before the house where I was, having been sent to me from Caesarea. 
Acts
11:12  “And the Spirit said to me to go
with them, not doubting at all. And these six brothers also went with me, and
we went into the man’s house. 
Acts
11:13  “And he told us how he had seen a
messenger standing in his house, who said to him, ‘Send men to Yapho, and call
for Shim‛on who is also called Kĕpha, 
Acts
11:14  who shall speak to you words, by
which you shall be saved, you and all your house.’ 
Acts
11:15  “And as I began to speak, the
Set-apart Spirit fell upon them, as upon us at the beginning. 
Acts
11:16  “And I remembered the word of the
Master, how He said, ‘Yoḥanan indeed immersed in water, but you shall be
immersed in the Set-apart Spirit.’ 
Acts
11:17  “So if Elohim gave them the same
gift as He gave us when we believed on the Master יהושע
Messiah, how was I able to withstand Elohim?” 
Acts
11:18  And having heard this, they were
silent, and praised Elohim, saying, “Then Elohim has indeed also given to the
gentiles repentance to life.”
Acts
11:19  Then, indeed, they who were
scattered because of the pressure that arose over Stephanos passed through to
Phoenicia, and Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except the Yehuḏim
only. 
Acts
11:20  But some of them were men from
Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they had come to Antioch, spoke to the Hellenists,
bringing the Good News: the Master יהושע ! 
Acts
11:21  And the hand of the Master was
with them, and a great number having believed turned to the Master. 
Acts
11:22  And word of it came to the ears of
the assembly in Yerushalayim, and they sent out Barnaḇah to go as far as
Antioch, 
Acts
11:23  who, having come, and seeing the
favour of Elohim, was glad, and encouraged them all with purpose of heart to
cleave to the Master. 
Acts
11:24  Because he was a good man, and
filled with the Set-apart Spirit and with belief. And large numbers were added
to the Master. 
Acts
11:25  Then Barnaḇah went to Tarsos
to seek Sha’ul, 
Acts
11:26  and having found him, he brought
him to Antioch. And it came to be that for an entire year they came together in
the assembly and taught large numbers. And the taught ones were called ‘Messianites’
first in Antioch. 
Acts
11:27  And in those days prophets came
from Yerushalayim to Antioch. 
Acts
11:28  And one of them, named Ḥaḡaḇ,
stood up and indicated by the Spirit that there was going to be a great
scarcity of food over all the world – which also took place under Claudius
Caesar. 
Acts
11:29  So the taught ones, each according
to his ability, decided to send relief to the brothers dwelling in Yehuḏah.

Acts
11:30  This they also did, and sent it to
the elders by the hands of Barnaḇah and Sha’ul. 
Acts
12:1  And about that time Herodes the
sovereign put forth his hands to do evil to some from the assembly. 
Acts
12:2  And he killed Ya‛aqoḇ
the brother of Yoḥanan with the sword. 
Acts
12:3  And seeing that it was pleasing to
the Yehuḏim, he proceeded further to arrest Kĕpha as well – and they
were the Days of Unleavened Bread. 
Acts
12:4  So when he had seized him, he put
him in prison, and delivered him to four squads of soldiers to watch over him,
intending to bring him before the people after Passover. 
Acts
12:5  So Kĕpha was indeed kept in
prison, but prayer was earnestly made to Elohim on his behalf by the assembly. 
Acts
12:6  And when Herodes was about to bring
him out, that night Kĕpha was sleeping, bound with two chains between two
soldiers. And the guards before the door were keeping the prison. 
Acts
12:7  And see, a messenger of יהוה
stood by, and a light shone in the building. And smiting the side of Kĕpha
he raised him up, saying, “Get up quickly!” And his chains fell off his hands. 
Acts
12:8  And the messenger said to him, “Gird
yourself and bind on your sandals,” and he did so. And he said to him, “Put on
your garment and follow me.” 
Acts
12:9  And coming out he followed him, and
knew not that what was done by the messenger was true, but thought he was
seeing a vision. 
Acts
12:10  And when they had passed the first
and the second guard posts, they came to the iron gate that leads to the city,
which opened to them by itself. And they went out and went down one street, and
the messenger instantly withdrew from him. 
Acts
12:11  And when Kĕpha had come to
himself, he said, “Now I truly know that יהוה has sent
His messenger, and delivered me from the hand of Herodes and from all the Yehuḏite people were
anticipating.” 
Acts
12:12  And having realised this, he went
to the house of Miryam, the mother of Yoḥanan who was also called Mark,
where many had gathered to pray. 
Acts
12:13  And when Kĕpha knocked at the
door of the gate, a girl named Rhode came to answer. 
Acts
12:14  And when she recognised Kĕpha’s
voice, she did not open the gate because of her joy, but ran in and reported
that Kĕpha stood before the gate. 
Acts
12:15  And they said to her, “You are
mad!” But she kept insisting that it was so, and they said, “It is his
messenger.” 
Acts
12:16  And Kĕpha continued knocking,
and having opened they saw him and were amazed. 
Acts
12:17  And motioning to them with his
hand to be silent, he told them how the Master brought him out of the prison.
And he said, “Report this to Ya‛aqoḇ and to the brothers.” And he
left and went to another place. 
Acts
12:18  Now when day came, there was no
small stir among the soldiers about what had become of Kĕpha. 
Acts
12:19  And when Herodes had searched for
him and did not find him, he examined the guards and ordered them to be led
away. And he went down from Yehuḏah to Caesarea, and stayed there. 
Acts
12:20  Now Herodes had been highly
displeased with the people of Tsor and Tsiḏon, but with one mind they
came to him, and having made Blastos the sovereign’s eunuch their friend, they
were asking for peace, because their country was supplied with food by the
sovereign’s country. 
Acts
12:21  And on an appointed day Herodes,
having put on his royal clothes, sat on his throne and gave an address to them.

Acts
12:22  And the people kept shouting, “The
voice of a mighty one and not of a man!” 
Acts
12:23  And instantly a messenger of יהוה
smote him, because he did not give the esteem to Elohim. And becoming
worm-eaten, he died. 
Acts
12:24  And the word of Elohim went on
growing and spreading. 
Acts
12:25  And Barnaḇah and Sha’ul
returned from Yerushalayim, having completed the service, and having taken with
them Yoḥanan who was also called Mark. 
Acts
13:1  And in the assembly that was at
Antioch there were certain prophets and teachers: both Barnaḇah and Shim‛on
who was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaḥĕm who had been
brought up with Herodes the district ruler, and Sha’ul. 
Acts
13:2  And as they were doing service to
the Master and fasted, the Set-apart Spirit said, “Separate unto Me Barnaḇah
and Sha’ul for the work to which I have called them.” 
Acts
13:3  Then having fasted and prayed, and
having laid hands on them, they sent them away. 
Acts
13:4  So they, having been sent out by
the Set-apart Spirit, went down to Seleukeia, and from there they sailed to
Cyprus. 
Acts
13:5  And having come into Salamis, they
proclaimed the word of Elohim in the congregations of the Yehuḏim. And
they also had Yoḥanan as an attendant. 
Acts
13:6  And having passed through all the
island to Paphos, they found a certain magician, a false prophet, a Yehuḏite
whose name was Bar-Yehoshua, 
Acts
13:7  who was with the proconsul, Sergius
Paulus, a man of understanding. This man, having called for Barnaḇah and
Sha’ul, earnestly sought to hear the word of Elohim. 
Acts
13:8  But Elumas the magician – for so
his name is translated – withstood them, seeking to turn the proconsul away
from the belief. 
Acts
13:9  Then Sha’ul, filled with the
Set-apart Spirit, looked intently at him, 
Acts
13:10  and said, “O son of the devil,
filled with all deceit and all recklessness, you enemy of all righteousness,
shall you not cease perverting the straight ways of יהוה
? 
Acts
13:11  “And now, see, the hand of יהוה
is upon you, and you shall be blind, not seeing the sun for a time.” And
instantly a dark mist fell on him, and he went around seeking someone to lead
him by the hand. 
Acts
13:12  And having seen what took place,
the proconsul believed, being astonished at the teaching of the Master. 
Acts
13:13  And having put out from Paphos,
Sha’ul and those with him came to Perge in Pamphulia. And Yoḥanan, having
left them, returned to Yerushalayim. 
Acts
13:14  But passing through from Perge,
they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the congregation on the Sabbath
day and sat down. 
Acts
13:15  And after the reading of the Torah
and the Prophets, the rulers of the congregation sent to them, saying, “Men,
brothers, if you have any word of encouragement for the people, speak.” 
Acts
13:16  And Sha’ul, standing up and
motioning with his hand said, “Men, Yisra’ĕlites, and those fearing
Elohim, listen: 
Acts
13:17  “The Elohim of this people Yisra’ĕl
did choose our fathers, and exalted the people in their sojourning in the land
of Mitsrayim, and with a high arm He brought them out of it. 
Acts
13:18  “Now for a time of about forty
years He sustained them in the wilderness. 
Acts
13:19  “And having destroyed seven
nations in the land of Kena‘an, He gave their land to them as an inheritance. 
Acts
13:20  “And after that He gave judges for
about four hundred and fifty years, until Shemu’ĕl the prophet. 
Acts
13:21  “But then they asked for a
sovereign, and Elohim gave them Sha’ul the son of Qish, a man of the tribe of
Binyamin, for forty years. 
Acts
13:22  “And having removed him, He raised
up for them Dawiḏ as sovereign, to whom also He gave witness and said, ‘I
have found Dawiḏ the son of Yishai, a man after My own heart, who shall
do all My desires.’ 
Acts
13:23  “From this one’s seed, according
to the promise, Elohim raised up for Yisra’ĕl a Saviour, יהושע,

Acts
13:24  after Yoḥanan had first
proclaimed the immersion of repentance to all the people of Yisra’ĕl,
before His coming. 
Acts
13:25  “And as Yoḥanan was
completing his mission, he said, ‘Who do you suppose I am? I am not He. But
see, there comes One after me, the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to
loose.’ 
Acts
13:26  “Men, brothers, sons of the race
of Aḇraham, and those among you fearing Elohim, to you the word of this
deliverance has been sent, 
Acts
13:27  for those dwelling in
Yerushalayim, and their rulers, because they did not know Him, nor even the
voices of the Prophets which are read every Sabbath, have filled them in having
judged Him. 
Acts
13:28  “And having found not one cause
for death, they asked Pilate that He should be put to death. 
Acts
13:29  “And when they had accomplished
all that was written concerning Him, taking Him down from the timber, they laid
Him in a tomb. 
Acts
13:30  “But Elohim raised Him from the
dead, 
Acts
13:31  and He was seen for many days by
those who came up with Him from Galil to Yerushalayim, who are His witnesses to
the people. 
Acts
13:32  “And we bring you the Good News,
the promise made to the fathers, 
Acts
13:33  that Elohim has filled this for
us, their children, having raised up יהושע, as it
has also been written in the second Psalm, ‘You are My Son, today I have
brought You forth.’ 
Acts
13:34  “And that He raised Him out of the
dead, no more to return to corruption, He has said thus, ‘I shall give you the
trustworthy kindnesses of Dawiḏ.’ 
Acts
13:35  “For this reason He also says in
another Psalm, ‘You shall not give Your Kind One to see corruption.’ 
Acts
13:36  “For Dawiḏ, indeed, having
served his own generation by the counsel of Elohim, fell asleep, was buried
with his fathers, and saw corruption, 
Acts
13:37  but He whom Elohim raised up saw
no corruption. 
Acts
13:38  “Let it therefore be known to you,
brothers, that through this One forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you, 
Acts
13:39  and by Him everyone who believes
is declared right from all sins from
which you were not able to be declared right by the Torah of Mosheh. 
Acts
13:40  “Watch then that what was said in
the prophets does not come upon you: 
Acts
13:41  “See, you despisers, marvel and
perish, for I work a work in your days, a work which you would in no way
believe if someone were to declare it to you.’ ” 
Acts
13:42  And when the Yehuḏim went
out of the congregation, the gentiles begged to have these words spoken to them
the next Sabbath. 
Acts
13:43  And when the meeting of the congregation had broken up, many of the Yehuḏim
and of the worshipping converts followed Sha’ul and Barnaḇah, who,
speaking to them, were urging them to continue in the favour of Elohim. 
Acts
13:44  And on the next Sabbath almost all
the city came together to hear the Word of Elohim. 
Acts
13:45  But when the Yehuḏim saw the
crowds, they were filled with jealousy. And contradicting and speaking evil,
they opposed what Sha’ul was saying. 
Acts
13:46  But speaking boldly, Sha’ul and
Barnaḇah said, “It was necessary that the word of Elohim should be spoken
to you first, but since you thrust it away, and judge yourselves unworthy of
everlasting life, see, we turn to the gentiles. 
Acts
13:47  “For so the Master has commanded
us, ‘I have set you to be a light to the gentiles, that you should be for
deliverance to the ends of the earth.’ ” 
Acts
13:48  And when the gentiles heard this,
they were glad and praised the Word of יהוה. And as
many as had been appointed to everlasting life believed. 
Acts
13:49  And the Word of יהוה
was being spread throughout the entire country. 
Acts
13:50  But the Yehuḏim stirred up
the worshipping and noble women and the chief men of the city, and raised up
persecution against Sha’ul and Barnaḇah, and threw them out of their
borders. 
Acts
13:51  And shaking off the dust from
their feet against them, they came to Ikonion. 
Acts
13:52  And the taught ones were filled
with joy and the Set-apart Spirit. 
Acts
14:1  And it came to be in Ikonion that
they went together into the congregation of the Yehuḏim, and spoke in
such a way that a great number of both Yehuḏim and Greeks believed. 
Acts
14:2  But the Yehuḏim who would not
obey stirred up the gentiles and evilly influenced their beings against the
brothers. 
Acts
14:3  So they remained a long time,
speaking boldly in the Master, who was bearing witness to the word of His
favour, giving signs and wonders to be done by their hands. 
Acts
14:4  And the crowd of the city was
divided, and some sided with the Yehuḏim, and some with the emissaries. 
Acts
14:5  But when a move took place by both
the gentiles and Yehuḏim, with their rulers, to mistreat and stone them, 
Acts
14:6  they became aware of it and fled to
Lustra and Derbe, cities of Lukaonia, and the country round about. 
Acts
14:7  And they were bringing the Good
News there. 
Acts
14:8  And in Lustra there was sitting a
certain man, disabled in his feet, a cripple from his mother’s womb, who had
never walked. 
Acts
14:9  This one heard Sha’ul speaking,
who, looking intently at him and seeing that he had belief to be healed, 
Acts
14:10  said with a loud voice, “Stand
upright on your feet!” And he sprang up and began to walk. 
Acts
14:11  And when the crowds saw what Sha’ul
had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in Lukaonian, “The mighty ones
have become like men and come down to us!” 
Acts
14:12  And they called Barnaḇah
Zeus, and Sha’ul Hermes, since he was the chief speaker. 
Acts
14:13  And the priest of Zeus, being in
front of their city, brought oxen and wreaths to the gates, and wished to offer
with the crowds. 
Acts
14:14  And when the emissaries Barnaḇah
and Sha’ul heard this, they tore their garments and ran in among the crowd,
crying out 
Acts
14:15  and saying, “Men, why are you
doing this? We also are men with the same nature as you, bringing to you the
Good News: to turn from these worthless matters to the living Elohim, who made
the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and all that is in them, 
Acts
14:16  who in past generations allowed
all the nations to walk in their own ways,
Acts
14:17  though, indeed, He did not leave
Himself without witness, doing good – giving us rain from heaven and
fruit-bearing seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.”
Acts
14:18  Even with these words they still
had difficulty in stopping the crowds from offering to them. 
Acts
14:19  But Yehuḏim arrived from
Antioch and Ikonion, and having won over the crowds, they stoned Sha’ul,
dragged him out of the city, thinking he was dead. 
Acts
14:20  But while the taught ones gathered
around him, he rose up and went into the city. And on the next day he went away
with Barnaḇah to Derbe. 
Acts
14:21  And having brought the Good News
to that city, and having made many taught ones, they returned to Lustra, and
Ikonion, and Antioch, 
Acts
14:22  strengthening the beings of the
taught ones, encouraging them to continue in the belief, and that through many
pressures we have to enter the reign of Elohim. 
Acts
14:23  And having appointed elders in
every assembly, having prayed with fasting, they committed them to the Master
in whom they had believed. 
Acts
14:24  And having passed through Pisidia,
they came to Pamphulia. 
Acts
14:25  And having spoken the word in
Perge, they went down to Attaleia, 
Acts
14:26  and from there they sailed to
Antioch, where they had been committed to the favour of Elohim for the work
which they had completed. 
Acts
14:27  And having arrived, and having
gathered together the assembly, they related all that Elohim had done with
them, and that He had opened the door of belief to the gentiles. 
Acts
14:28  And they remained there a long
time with the taught ones. 
Acts
15:1  And certain men came down from Yehuḏah
and were teaching the brothers, “Unless you are circumcised, according to the
practice of Mosheh, you are unable to be saved.” 
Acts
15:2  So when Sha’ul and Barnaḇah
had no small dissension and dispute with them, they arranged for Sha’ul and
Barnaḇah and certain others of them to go up to Yerushalayim, to the
emissaries and elders, about this question. 
Acts
15:3  So, being sent on their way by the
assembly, they passed through Phoenicia and Shomeron, relating the conversion
of the gentiles. And they were causing great joy to all the brothers. 
Acts
15:4  And having arrived in Yerushalayim,
they were received by the assembly and the emissaries and the elders. And they
reported all that Elohim had done with them. 
Acts
15:5  And some of the believers who
belonged to the sect of the Pharisees, rose up, saying, “It is necessary to
circumcise them, and to command them to keep the Torah of Mosheh.” 
Acts
15:6  And the emissaries and elders came
together to look into this matter. 
Acts
15:7  And when there had been much
dispute, Kĕpha rose up and said to them, “Men, brothers, you know that a
good while ago Elohim chose among us, that by my mouth the gentiles should hear
the word of the Good News and believe. 
Acts
15:8  “And Elohim, who knows the heart,
bore witness to them, by giving them the Set-apart Spirit, as also to us, 
Acts
15:9  and made no distinction between us
and them, cleansing their hearts by belief. 
Acts
15:10  “Now then, why do you try Elohim
by putting a yoke on the neck of the taught ones which neither our fathers nor
we were able to bear? 
Acts
15:11  “But through the favour of the
Master יהושע Messiah we trust to be saved, in the
same way as they.” 
Acts
15:12  And all the crowd was silent and
were listening to Barnaḇah and Sha’ul declaring how many miracles and
wonders Elohim did among the gentiles, through them. 
Acts
15:13  And after they were silent, Ya‛aqoḇ
answered, saying, “Men, brothers, listen to me: 
Acts
15:14  “Shim‛on has declared how
Elohim first visited the gentiles to take out of them a people for His Name. 
Acts
15:15  “And the words of the prophets
agree with this, as it has been written: 
Acts
15:16  ‘After this I shall return and
rebuild the Booth of Dawiḏ which has fallen down. And I shall rebuild its
ruins, and I shall set it up, 
Acts
15:17  so that the remnant of mankind
shall seek יהוה, even all the gentiles on whom My Name
has been called, says יהוה who is doing all this,’ 
Acts
15:18  who has made this known from of
old. 
Acts
15:19  “Therefore I judge that we should
not trouble those from among the gentiles who are turning to Elohim, 
Acts
15:20  but that we write to them to
abstain from the defilements of idols, and from whoring, and from what is
strangled, and from blood.
Acts
15:21  “For from ancient generations
Mosheh has, in every city, those proclaiming him – being read in the
congregations every Sabbath.” 
Acts
15:22  Then it seemed good to the
emissaries and elders, with all the assembly, to send chosen men from among
them to Antioch with Sha’ul and Barnaḇah: Yehuḏah being called
Barsabba, and Sila, leading men among the brothers, 
Acts
15:23  having written by their hand this:
The emissaries and the elders and the brothers, To the brothers who are of the
gentiles in Antioch, and Syria, and Kilikia: Greetings. 
Acts
15:24  Since we have heard that some who
went out from us have troubled you with words, unsettling your lives, to whom
we gave no command – 
Acts
15:25  it seemed good to us, having
become of one mind, to send chosen men to you with our beloved Barnaḇah
and Sha’ul, 
Acts
15:26  men who have given up their lives
for the Name of our Master יהושע Messiah. 
Acts
15:27  We have therefore sent Yehuḏah
and Sila, who are also confirming this by word of mouth. 
Acts
15:28  For it seemed good to the
Set-apart Spirit, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these
necessities: 
Acts
15:29  that you abstain from what is
offered to idols, and blood, and what is strangled, and whoring. If you keep
yourselves from these, you shall do well. Be strong!
Acts
15:30  They, therefore, being sent off,
went to Antioch. And having gathered the crowd together, they delivered the
letter. 
Acts
15:31  And having read it, they rejoiced
over its encouragement. 
Acts
15:32  And Yehuḏah and Sila, being
themselves also prophets, encouraged the brothers with many words and
strengthened them. 
Acts
15:33  And having spent some time, they
were sent back in peace from the brothers to the emissaries. 
Acts
15:34  But it seemed good to Sila to
remain. 
Acts
15:35  And Sha’ul and Barnaḇah
continued in Antioch, teaching and bringing, with many others also, the Good
News: the Word of יהוה ! 
Acts
15:36  And after some days Sha’ul said to
Barnaḇah, “Let us now go back and visit our brothers in every city where
we proclaimed the Word of יהוה, and see how they are.” 
Acts
15:37  And Barnaḇah purposed to
take with them Yoḥanan called Mark. 
Acts
15:38  But Sha’ul thought it not fit to
take with them the one who withdrew from them in Pamphulia, and had not gone
with them to the work. 
Acts
15:39  A sharp feeling therefore came to
be, so that they parted from one another. And so Barnaḇah took Mark and
sailed to Cyprus. 
Acts
15:40  And Sha’ul chose Sila and went
off, being committed by the brothers to the favour of Elohim. 
Acts
15:41  And he went through Syria and
Kilikia, strengthening the assemblies. 
Acts
16:1  And he came to Derbe and Lustra.
And see, a certain taught one was there, named Timothy, the son of a certain
Yehuḏite woman who believed – but his father was Greek – 
Acts
16:2  who was well spoken of by the
brothers who were at Lustra and Ikonion. 
Acts
16:3  Sha’ul wished to have this one go
with him. And he took him and circumcised him because of the Yehuḏim who
were in those places, for they all knew that his father was Greek. 
Acts
16:4  And as they went through the
cities, they delivered to them the regulations to keep, which were decided by
the emissaries and elders at Yerushalayim. 
Acts
16:5  Then, indeed, the assemblies were
strengthened in the belief, and increased in number every day. 
Acts
16:6  And having passed through Phrygia
and the Galatian country, they were forbidden by the Set-apart Spirit to speak
the word in Asia. 
Acts
16:7  When they came to Musia, they tried
to go into Bithunia, but the Spirit did not allow them. 
Acts
16:8  And having passed by Musia, they
came down to Troas. 
Acts
16:9  And in the night a vision appeared
to Sha’ul: A man of Makedonia was standing, begging him and saying, “Come over
to Makedonia and help us.” 
Acts
16:10  And when he saw the vision,
immediately we sought to go to Makedonia, concluding that the Master had called
us to bring the Good News to them. 
Acts
16:11  Therefore, sailing from Troas, we
ran a straight course to Samothrake, and the next day came to Neapolis, 
Acts
16:12  and from there to Philippi, which
is the principal city of that part of Makedonia, a colony. And we were staying
in that city for some days. 
Acts
16:13  And on the Sabbath day we went
outside the city by a river, where there used to be prayer. And having sat down
we were speaking to the women who met there. 
Acts
16:14  And a certain woman named Ludia, a
seller of purple from the city of Thyatira, worshipping Elohim, was hearing,
whose heart the Master did open to pay attention to what Sha’ul said. 
Acts
16:15  And when she was immersed, and her
household, she begged us, saying, “If you have judged me to be believing in the
Master, come to my house and stay.” And she urged us. 
Acts
16:16  And it came to be, as we went to
prayer, that a certain slave girl possessed with a spirit of Puthon, did meet
us, who brought her masters much profit by foretelling. 
Acts
16:17  Having followed Sha’ul and us, she
cried out, saying, “These men are the servants of the Most High Elohim, who
proclaim to us the way of deliverance.” 
Acts
16:18  And she was doing this for many
days. But Sha’ul, greatly annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, “I command
you in the Name of יהושע Messiah to come out of
her.” And it came out that same hour. 
Acts
16:19  But when her masters saw that
their anticipation of money-making was gone, they seized Sha’ul and Sila and
dragged them into the market-place to the rulers. 
Acts
16:20  And having brought them to the
captains, they said, “These men, being Yehuḏim, greatly disturb our city,

Acts
16:21  and they proclaim practices which
are not right for us to receive nor to do, being Romans.” 
Acts
16:22  And the crowd rose up together
against them. And the captains tore off their garments and commanded them to be
beaten with rods. 
Acts
16:23  And having laid many blows upon
them, they threw them into prison, commanding the jailer to keep them safely, 
Acts
16:24  who, having received such a
command, put them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks. 
Acts
16:25  And at midnight Sha’ul and Sila
were praying and singing songs to Elohim, and the prisoners were listening to
them. 
Acts
16:26  And suddenly a great earthquake
took place, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken, and immediately
all the doors were opened and all the chains came loose. 
Acts
16:27  And the jailer, awaking from sleep
and seeing the prison doors open, thinking the prisoners had fled, drew his
sword and was about to kill himself. 
Acts
16:28  But Sha’ul called with a loud
voice, saying, “Do no harm to yourself, for we are all here.” 
Acts
16:29  And asking for a light, he ran in,
and fell down trembling before Sha’ul and Sila. 
Acts
16:30  And having led them outside he
said, “Masters, what do I have to do to be saved?” 
Acts
16:31  And they said, “Believe on the
Master יהושע Messiah, and you shall be saved, you
and your household.” 
Acts
16:32  And they spoke the Word of יהוה
to him and to all who were in his house. 
Acts
16:33  And taking them in that hour of
the night, he washed their wounds, and immediately he was immersed, he and all
that were his. 
Acts
16:34  And having brought them into his
house, he set food before them. And he rejoiced with all his household, having
believed in Elohim. 
Acts
16:35  And when day came, the authorities
sent the officers, saying, “Let these men go.” 
Acts
16:36  And the jailer reported these
words to Sha’ul, saying, “The captains have sent to let you go. Now then, come
out and go in peace.” 
Acts
16:37  But Sha’ul said to them, “They
have beaten us publicly, uncondemned, being Romans. They have thrown us into
prison, and now, do they throw us out secretly? No indeed! Let them come
themselves and bring us out.” 
Acts
16:38  And the officers reported these
words to the authorities, and they were afraid when they heard that they were
Romans. 
Acts
16:39  And having come, they pleaded with
them and brought them out, and asked them to leave the city. 
Acts
16:40  So coming out of the prison they
went to Ludia, and seeing the brothers, they encouraged them, and went forth. 
Acts
17:1  And having passed through
Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonike, where there was a
congregation of the Yehuḏim. 
Acts
17:2  And according to his practice, Sha’ul
went in unto them, and for three Sabbaths was reasoning with them from the
Scriptures, 
Acts
17:3  explaining and pointing out that
the Messiah had to suffer and rise again from the dead, and saying, “This is the Messiah, יהושע,
whom I proclaim to you.” 
Acts
17:4  And some of them did believe, and a
large number of the worshipping Greeks, and not a few of the leading women,
joined Sha’ul and Sila. 
Acts
17:5  But the Yehuḏim who did not
believe, having become envious, took some of the wicked men from the
market-place, and gathering a mob, set all the city in an uproar and came upon
the house of Jason, and were seeking to bring them out to the people. 
Acts
17:6  But not finding them, they dragged
Jason and some of the brothers to the city rulers, crying out, “They who have
turned the world upside down have come here too, 
Acts
17:7  whom Jason has received. And all of
them are acting contrary to the dogmas of Caesar, saying there is another
sovereign, יהושע.” 
Acts
17:8  And they troubled the crowd and the
city rulers when they heard this. 
Acts
17:9  And when they had received a pledge
from Jason and the rest, they let them go. 
Acts
17:10  And the brothers immediately sent
Sha’ul and Sila away by night to Beroia, who, having come, went into the
congregation of the Yehuḏim. 
Acts
17:11  Now these were more noble than
those in Thessalonike, who received the word with great eagerness, and searched
the Scriptures daily, if these words
were so. 
Acts
17:12  Then many of them truly believed,
and also not a few of the Greeks, decent women as well as men. 
Acts
17:13  And when the Yehuḏim from
Thessalonike came to know that the word of Elohim was proclaimed by Sha’ul at
Beroia, they came there also and stirred up the crowds. 
Acts
17:14  And then immediately the brothers
sent Sha’ul away, to go to the sea, but both Sila and Timothy stayed there. 
Acts
17:15  And those who arranged for Sha’ul
brought him to Athens. And receiving a command for Sila and Timothy to join him
as soon as possible, they departed. 
Acts
17:16  But while Sha’ul was waiting for
them at Athens, his spirit was stirred up within him when he saw that the city
was utterly idolatrous. 
Acts
17:17  Therefore, indeed, he was
reasoning in the congregation with the Yehuḏim and with the gentile
worshippers, and in the market-place daily with those who met there. 
Acts
17:18  And some of the Epicurean and
Stoic philosophers encountered him. And some were saying, “What does this
babbler wish to say?” Others said, “He seems to be a proclaimer of strange
mighty ones” – because to them he brought the Good News: יהושע
and the resurrection! 
Acts
17:19  So they laid hold of him and
brought him to the Areopagus, saying, “Are we able to know what this fresh
teaching is of which you speak? 
Acts
17:20  “For you are bringing some strange
matters to our ears. We wish, then,
to know what these mean.” 
Acts
17:21  For all the Athenians and the
strangers living there spent their leisure time in doing naught but to speak or
to hear what is fresh. 
Acts
17:22  And having stood in the midst of
the Areopagus Sha’ul said, “Men of Athens, I see that you are very religious in
every matter. 
Acts
17:23  “For passing through and observing
the objects of your worship, I even found an altar with this inscription: TO
THE UNKNOWN MIGHTY ONE. Not knowing then whom you worship, I make Him known to
you: 
Acts
17:24  “ יהוה,
who made the world and all that is in it, this One being Master of heaven and
earth, does not dwell in dwellings made with hands.
Acts
17:25  “Nor is He served with men’s hands
– as if needing any – Himself giving to all life, and breath, and all else. 
Acts
17:26  “And He has made from one blood
every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, having ordained
beforehand the times and the boundaries of their dwelling, 
Acts
17:27  to seek the Master, if at least
they would reach out for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one
of us. 
Acts
17:28  “For in Him we live and move and
are, as also some of your own poets have said, ‘For we are also His offspring.’

Acts
17:29  “Now then, since we are the
offspring of Elohim, we should not think that the Elohim is like gold or silver
or stone, an image made by the skill and thought of man. 
Acts
17:30  “Truly, then, having overlooked
these times of ignorance, Elohim now commands all men everywhere to repent, 
Acts
17:31  because He has set a day on which
He is going to judge the world in righteousness by a Man whom He has appointed,
having given proof of this to all by raising Him from the dead.”
Acts
17:32  And hearing of the resurrection of
the dead, some indeed mocked, while others said, “We shall hear you again
concerning this.” 
Acts
17:33  And so Sha’ul went out from among
them. 
Acts
17:34  But some men joined him and
believed, among them Dionusios the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and
others with them. 
Acts
18:1  And after this Sha’ul left Athens
and went to Corinth. 
Acts
18:2  And he found a certain Yehuḏite
named Aqulas, born in Pontos, who had recently come from Italy with his wife
Priscilla – because Claudius had commanded all the Yehuḏim to leave Rome –
and he came to them. 
Acts
18:3  And because he was of the same
trade, he stayed with them and was working, for they were tentmakers by trade. 
Acts
18:4  And he was reasoning in the
congregation every Sabbath, and won over both Yehuḏim and Greeks. 
Acts
18:5  And when Sila and Timothy came down
from Makedonia, Sha’ul was pressed by the Spirit, and earnestly witnessed to
the Yehuḏim that יהושע is the Messiah. 
Acts
18:6  However, when they resisted and
blasphemed, he shook his garments and said to them, “Your blood is upon your
head, I am clean. From now on I shall go to the gentiles.” 
Acts
18:7  And having left there he came to
the house of a certain man named Justus, who worshipped Elohim, whose house was
next to the congregation. 
Acts
18:8  And Crispus, the ruler of the
congregation, did believe in the Master with all his household. And many of the
Corinthians, hearing, believed and were immersed. 
Acts
18:9  And the Master spoke to Sha’ul in
the night by a vision, “Do not be afraid, but speak, and do not be silent, 
Acts
18:10  because I am with you, and no one
shall attack you to do you evil, because I have much people in this city.” 
Acts
18:11  And he remained a year and six
months, teaching the Word of יהוה among them. 
Acts
18:12  And when Gallion was proconsul of
Achaia, the Yehuḏim with one mind rose up against Sha’ul and brought him
to the judgment seat, 
Acts
18:13  saying, “This one does seduce men
to worship Elohim contrary to the Torah.” 
Acts
18:14  And as Sha’ul was about to open
his mouth, Gallion said to the Yehuḏim, “If it were a matter of wrongdoing
or wicked recklessness, O Yehuḏim, there would be reason why I should
bear with you. 
Acts
18:15  “But if it is a question of words
and names and a law which is among you, see to it yourselves, for I do not wish
to be a judge of these matters.” 
Acts
18:16  And he drove them away from the
judgment seat. 
Acts
18:17  And all the Greeks took Sosthenes,
the ruler of the congregation, and beat him before the judgment seat. But
Gallion showed no concern whatever. 
Acts
18:18  And Sha’ul, having stayed several
days more, having taken leave of the brothers, was sailing for Syria, and
Priscilla and Aqulas were with him, having shaved his hair at Kenḥrea,
for he had taken a vow. 
Acts
18:19  And he came to Ephesos, and left
them there, but he himself went into the congregation and reasoned with the
Yehuḏim. 
Acts
18:20  And when they asked him to stay a
longer time with them, he declined, 
Acts
18:21  but took leave of them, saying, “I
have to keep this coming festival in Yerushalayim by all means, but I shall
come back to you, Elohim desiring so.” And he sailed from Ephesos. 
Acts
18:22  And having come to Caesarea, going
up and greeting the assembly, he went down to Antioch. 
Acts
18:23  And having spent some time there,
he went forth, passing through the country of Galatia and on through Phrygia,
strengthening all the taught ones. 
Acts
18:24  And a certain Yehuḏite named
Apollos, born at Alexandria, a learned man and mighty in the Scriptures, came
to Ephesos. 
Acts
18:25  This one had been instructed in
the way of the Master. And being fervent in spirit, he was speaking and
teaching the matters about the Master
exactly, though he knew only the immersion of Yoḥanan. 
Acts
18:26  And he began to speak boldly in
the congregation. And when Aqulas and Priscilla heard him, they took him aside
and explained to him the way of Elohim more exactly. 
Acts
18:27  And when he intended to pass
through to Achaia, the brothers, having encouraged him, wrote to the taught
ones to receive him, who, having arrived, greatly helped those who believed
through favour, 
Acts
18:28  for with power he refuted the Yehuḏim
publicly, showing from the Scriptures that יהושע
is the Messiah. 
Acts
19:1  And it came to be, while Apollos
was at Corinth, that Sha’ul, having passed through the upper parts, came to
Ephesos. And having found some taught ones, 
Acts
19:2  he said to them, “Did you receive
the Set-apart Spirit when you believed?” And they said to him, “No, we have not
even heard that there is a Set-apart Spirit.” 
Acts
19:3  And he said to them, “Into what
then were you immersed?” And they said, “Into Yoḥanan’s immersion.” 
Acts
19:4  And Sha’ul said, “Yoḥanan
indeed immersed with an immersion of repentance, saying to the people that they
should believe in the One who is coming after him, that is, in Messiah יהושע.”

Acts
19:5  And when they heard this, they were
immersed in the Name of the Master יהושע. 
Acts
19:6  And when Sha’ul had laid hands on
them, the Set-apart Spirit came upon them, and they were speaking in tongues
and prophesying. 
Acts
19:7  And all the men were about twelve. 
Acts
19:8  And having gone into the
congregation he spoke boldly for three months, reasoning and persuading
concerning the reign of Elohim. 
Acts
19:9  But when some were hardened and did
not believe, speaking evil of the Way before the crowd, he withdrew from them
and separated the taught ones, reasoning daily in the school of Turannos. 
Acts
19:10  And this took place for two years,
so that all who dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Master יהושע,
both Yehuḏim and Greeks. 
Acts
19:11  And Elohim worked unusual miracles
through the hands of Sha’ul, 
Acts
19:12  so that even handkerchiefs or
aprons were brought from his body to the sick, and the diseases left them and
the wicked spirits went out of them. 
Acts
19:13  But certain roving Yehuḏite
exorcists took it upon themselves to call the Name of the Master יהושע
over those who had wicked spirits, saying, “We exorcise you by יהושע
whom Sha’ul proclaims.” 
Acts
19:14  And there were seven sons of a
certain Skeua, a Yehuḏite chief priest, who were doing this. 
Acts
19:15  And the wicked spirit answering,
said, “ יהושע I know, and Sha’ul I know, but who
are you?” 
Acts
19:16  And the man in whom the wicked
spirit was leaped on them, overpowered them, and prevailed against them, so
that they fled out of that house naked and wounded. 
Acts
19:17  And this became known to all, both
Yehuḏim and Greeks dwelling in Ephesos. And fear fell on them all, and
the Name of the Master יהושע was made great. 
Acts
19:18  And many who had believed came
confessing and declaring their deeds. 
Acts
19:19  And many of those who had
practised magic brought their books together, burning them before all. And they
reckoned up the value of them, and found it to be fifty thousand pieces of
silver. 
Acts
19:20  So the word of the Master was
growing mightily and prevailing. 
Acts
19:21  Now when these matters had been completed, Sha’ul
purposed in the Spirit, when he had passed through Makedonia and Achaia, to go
to Yerushalayim, saying, “After I have been there, I have to see Rome too.” 
Acts
19:22  And having sent into Makedonia two
of those assisting him, Timothy and Ĕrastos, he himself remained in Asia
for a time. 
Acts
19:23  And about that time there came to
be a great commotion about the Way. 
Acts
19:24  For a certain man named Demetrios,
a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Artemis, provided no little business
to the craftsmen, 
Acts
19:25  who, having called them together,
with the workers of similar trade,
said, “Men, you know that our wealth is from this business. 
Acts
19:26  “And you see and hear that not
only at Ephesos, but throughout almost all Asia, this Sha’ul has persuaded and turned
away a large number, saying that they are not mighty ones which are made with
hands. 
Acts
19:27  “And not only is this trade of
ours in danger of coming to rejection, but also that the temple of the great
female mighty one Artemis whom all Asia and the world worship, shall be
regarded as worthless and her greatness diminished.” 
Acts
19:28  And having heard this, they were
filled with rage and cried out, saying, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!” 
Acts
19:29  And the entire city was filled
with confusion, and they rushed with one mind into the theatre, having seized
Gaios and Aristarchos, Makedonians, Sha’ul’s fellow travellers. 
Acts
19:30  And Sha’ul, intending to go in
among the mob, the taught ones did not allow him. 
Acts
19:31  And some of the officials of Asia,
being his friends, sent to him begging him not to risk himself into the
theatre. 
Acts
19:32  Then others indeed shouted this
and others that, for the assembly was confused, and most of them did not know
why they had come together. 
Acts
19:33  And some of the crowd instructed
Alexander – the Yehuḏim putting him forward. And Alexander motioned with
his hand, and wished to make his defence to the people. 
Acts
19:34  But having recognised that he was
a Yehuḏite, all with one voice cried out for about two hours, “Great is
Artemis of the Ephesians!” 
Acts
19:35  And the city clerk, having calmed
the crowd, said, “Men of Ephesos, what man is there who does not know that the
city of the Ephesians is the guardian of the temple of the great female mighty
one Artemis, and of that which fell down from Zeus? 
Acts
19:36  “Therefore, if these matters are undeniable, you need to be
calm, and do not act rashly. 
Acts
19:37  “For you have brought these men
here who are neither temple-robbers nor speaking evil of your female mighty
one. 
Acts
19:38  “If truly then Demetrios and his
fellow craftsmen have a case against anyone, the courts are open and there are
proconsuls. Let them accuse one another. 
Acts
19:39  “And if you have any further
complaint, it shall be settled in the regular assembly. 
Acts
19:40  “For we are in danger of being
accused of riot concerning today, there being no reason which we could give to
account for this disorderly gathering.” 
Acts
19:41  And having said this, he dismissed
the assembly. 
Acts
20:1  After the uproar had ceased, Sha’ul
called the taught ones to him, and having embraced them, went away to go to
Makedonia. 
Acts
20:2  And having gone through those
parts, and having encouraged them with many words, he came to Greece, 
Acts
20:3  where he spent three months. When
he was about to sail to Syria, he decided to return through Makedonia, as a
plot was made against him by the Yehuḏim. 
Acts
20:4  And he was accompanied by Sopater
of Beroia, and Aristarchos and Sekundos of the Thessalonians, and Gaios of
Derbe, and Timothy, and Tuchikos and Trophimos of Asia. 
Acts
20:5  And these, going ahead, waited for
us at Troas. 
Acts
20:6  And we sailed away from Philippi
after the Days of Unleavened Bread, and came to them at Troas in five days,
where we stayed seven days. 
Acts
20:7  And on the first day of the
week,the taught ones having gathered together to break bread, Sha’ul, intending
to depart the next day, was reasoning with them and was extending the word till
midnight. 
Acts
20:8  And there were many lamps in the
upper room where they were assembled. 
Acts
20:9  And a certain young man, by name
Eutuchos, was sitting in a window, being overpowered by a deep sleep. As Sha’ul
kept on reasoning, he was overcome by sleep and fell down from the third
storey, and was picked up dead. 
Acts
20:10  And Sha’ul, having gone down, fell
on him, and embracing him said, “Do not be upset, for his life is in him.” 
Acts
20:11  Then going up again, and having
broken bread and eaten, he talked a long while, even till daybreak, and so went
forth. 
Acts
20:12  And they brought the young man in
alive, and were encouraged, not a little. 
Acts
20:13  And we, going ahead to the ship,
sailed to Assos, intending to take Sha’ul on board there, for so he had
arranged, intending himself to go on foot. 
Acts
20:14  And when he met us at Assos, we
took him on board and came to Mitulene. 
Acts
20:15  And from there we sailed, and the
next day came opposite Chios. And the next day we arrived at Samos and remained
at Trogullion. And the following day we came to Miletos. 
Acts
20:16  For Sha’ul had decided to sail
past Ephesos, so that he might lose no time in Asia, for he was hurrying to be
at Yerushalayim, if possible, on the Day of the Festival of Weeks.
Acts
20:17  And from Miletos he sent to
Ephesos and called for the elders of the assembly. 
Acts
20:18  And when they had come to him, he
said to them, “You know, from the first day that I came to Asia, how I was with
you all the time, 
Acts
20:19  serving the Master with all
humility, with many tears and trials which befell me by the plotting of the
Yehuḏim, 
Acts
20:20  as I kept back no matter that was profitable, but
proclaimed it to you, and taught you publicly and from house to house, 
Acts
20:21  witnessing to Yehuḏim, and
also to Greeks: repentance toward Elohim and belief in our Master יהושע
Messiah. 
Acts
20:22  “And now see, I go bound in the
spirit to Yerushalayim, not knowing what is going to meet me there, 
Acts
20:23  except that the Set-apart Spirit
witnesses in every city, saying that chains and pressures await me. 
Acts
20:24  “But I do not count my life of any
value to me, so that I might accomplish my mission with joy, and the service
which I received from the Master יהושע, to bear
witness to the Good News of the favour of Elohim. 
Acts
20:25  “And now see, I know that you all,
among whom I went about proclaiming the reign of Elohim, shall see my face no
more. 
Acts
20:26  “Therefore I witness to you this
day that I am clear from the blood of all. 
Acts
20:27  “For I kept not back from
declaring to you all the counsel of Elohim. 
Acts
20:28  “Therefore take heed to yourselves
and to all the flock, among which the Set-apart Spirit has made you overseers,
to shepherd the assembly of Elohim which He has purchased with His own blood. 
Acts
20:29  “For I know this, that after my
departure savage wolves shall come in among you, not sparing the flock.
Acts
20:30  “Also from among yourselves men
shall arise, speaking distorted teachings,
to draw away the taught ones after themselves. 
Acts
20:31  “Therefore watch, remembering that
for three years, night and day, I did not cease to warn each one with tears. 
Acts
20:32  “And now, brothers, I commit you
to Elohim and to the word of His favour, which is able to build you up and give
you an inheritance among all those having been set apart. 
Acts
20:33  “I have coveted no one’s silver or
gold or garments. 
Acts
20:34  “And you yourselves know that
these hands supplied my needs, and for those who were with me. 
Acts
20:35  “All this I did show you, by
labouring like this, that you ought to help the weak. And remember the words of
the Master יהושע, that He said, ‘It is more
blessed to give than to receive.’ ” 
Acts
20:36  And having said this, he knelt
down and prayed with them all. 
Acts
20:37  And there was much weeping among
them all, and falling on Sha’ul’s neck, they kissed him, 
Acts
20:38  distressed most of all because of
the word which he had said, that they would see his face no more. And they went
with him to the ship. 
Acts
21:1  And it came to be, when we had torn
ourselves away from them, and had set sail, we ran a straight course and came
to Cos, and the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara. 
Acts
21:2  And having found a ship passing
over to Phoenicia, we went aboard and set sail. 
Acts
21:3  And having sighted Cyprus, and
having passed it on the left, we sailed to Syria, and landed at Tsor, for the
ship was to unload her cargo there. 
Acts
21:4  And having found taught ones, we
remained there seven days. And they told Sha’ul through the Spirit not to go up
to Yerushalayim. 
Acts
21:5  And when it came to be that our
days there were ended, we left and went on, all of them accompanying us, with
wives and children, till we were out of the city. And kneeling down on the
beach, we prayed. 
Acts
21:6  And having embraced one another, we
boarded the ship, and they returned to their homes. 
Acts
21:7  And when we had completed our
voyage from Tsor, we came to Ptolemais. And having greeted the brothers we
stayed with them one day. 
Acts
21:8  And on the next day we left and
came to Caesarea, and went into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one
of the seven, and stayed with him. 
Acts
21:9  Now this one had four maiden
daughters who prophesied. 
Acts
21:10  And as we were staying many days,
a certain prophet named Ḥaḡaḇ came down from Yehuḏah, 
Acts
21:11  and having come to us, he took the
girdle of Sha’ul, bound his own hands and feet, and said, “Thus says the Set-apart
Spirit, ‘Thus shall the Yehuḏim at Yerushalayim bind the man who owns
this girdle, and deliver him into the hands of the gentiles.’ ” 
Acts
21:12  And when we heard this, both we
and those from that place begged him not to go up to Yerushalayim. 
Acts
21:13  And Sha’ul answered, “What do you
mean by weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound, but
also to die at Yerushalayim for the Name of the Master יהושע.”

Acts
21:14  And as he could not be persuaded,
we ceased, saying, “Let the desire of the Master be done.” 
Acts
21:15  And after those days, having made
ready, we went up to Yerushalayim. 
Acts
21:16  And also some of the taught ones
from Caesarea went with us and brought with them one, Mnason of Cyprus, an
early taught one, with whom we were to lodge. 
Acts
21:17  And when we had arrived in
Yerushalayim, the brothers received us gladly. 
Acts
21:18  And on the following day Sha’ul
went in with us to Ya‛aqoḇ, and all the elders came. 
Acts
21:19  And having greeted them, he was
relating one by one what Elohim had done among the gentiles through his
service. 
Acts
21:20  And when they heard it, they
praised the Master. And they said to him, “You see, brother, how many thousands
of Yehuḏim there are who have believed, and all are ardent for the Torah.

Acts
21:21  “And they have been informed about
you that you teach all the Yehuḏim who are among the gentiles to forsake
Mosheh, saying not to circumcise the children nor to walk according to the
practices. 
Acts
21:22  “What then is it? They shall
certainly hear that you have come. 
Acts
21:23  “So do this, what we say to you:
We have four men who have taken a vow. 
Acts
21:24  “Take them and be cleansed with
them, and pay their expenses so that they shave their heads. And all shall know
that what they have been informed about you is not so, but that you yourself
also walk orderly, keeping the Torah. 
Acts
21:25  “But concerning the gentiles who
believe, we have written and decided that they should keep themselves from what
is offered to idols, and blood, and what is strangled, and whoring.”
Acts
21:26  Then Sha’ul took the men on the
next day, and having been cleansed with them, went into the Set-apart Place to
announce the completion of the days of separation – until the offering should
be presented for each one of them. 
Acts
21:27  And when the seven days were
almost ended, the Yehuḏim from Asia, seeing him in the Set-apart Place,
were stirring up all the crowd, and they laid hands on him, 
Acts
21:28  crying out, “Men of Yisra’ĕl,
help! This is the man who is teaching all men everywhere against the people,
and the Torah, and this place. And besides, he also brought Greeks into the
Set-apart Place and has profaned this Set-apart Place.” 
Acts
21:29  Because they had previously seen
Trophimos the Ephesian with him in the city, whom they thought that Sha’ul had
brought into the Set-apart Place. 
Acts
21:30  And the entire city was moved, and
the people rushed together, seized Sha’ul, and dragged him out of the Set-apart
Place. And immediately the doors were shut. 
Acts
21:31  And while they were seeking to
kill him, a report came to the commander of the company of soldiers that all Yerushalayim was in confusion. 
Acts
21:32  At once he took soldiers and
captains, and ran down to them. And they, having seen the commander and the
soldiers, stopped beating Sha’ul. 
Acts
21:33  Then the commander came near and
took him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains, and was asking who he
was and what he had done. 
Acts
21:34  And in the crowd some were
shouting this and others that. And not being able to ascertain the truth
because of the uproar, he commanded him to be taken into the barracks. 
Acts
21:35  And when he came to the stairs, he
had to be carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd. 
Acts
21:36  For a large number of the people
followed after, crying out, “Away with him!” 
Acts
21:37  And as Sha’ul was about to be led
into the barracks, he said to the commander, “Am I allowed to say somewhat to
you?” And he said, “Do you know Greek? 
Acts
21:38  “Are you not the Mitsrite who some
time ago stirred up a revolt and led the four thousand assassins out into the
wilderness?” 
Acts
21:39  But Sha’ul replied, “I am a Yehuḏite
from Tarsos, in Kilikia, a citizen of no mean city. And I beg you, allow me to
speak to the people.” 
Acts
21:40  And having given him permission,
Sha’ul, standing on the stairs motioned with his hand to the people. And when
there was a great silence, he spoke in the Heḇrew language, saying,
Acts
22:1  “Men, brothers, and fathers, hear
my defence before you now.” 
Acts
22:2  And when they heard that he spoke
to them in the Heḇrew language, they kept greater silence. And he said:
Acts
22:3  “I am indeed a Yehuḏite,
having been born in Tarsos of Kilikia, but brought up in this city at the feet
of Gamli’ĕl, having been instructed according to the exactness of the
Torah of our fathers, being ardent for Elohim, as you all are today, 
Acts
22:4  who persecuted this Way to the
death, binding and delivering up into prisons both men and women, 
Acts
22:5  as also the high priest bears me
witness, and all the eldership, from whom I also received letters to the
brothers, and went to Damascus to bring in chains even those who were there to
Yerushalayim to be punished. 
Acts
22:6  “And it came to be, as I was
journeying and coming near Damascus, about noon, suddenly a great light shone
around me out of the heaven, 
Acts
22:7  and I fell to the ground and heard
a voice saying to me, ‘Sha’ul, Sha’ul, why do you persecute Me?’ 
Acts
22:8  “And I answered, ‘Who are You,
Master?’ And He said to me, ‘I am יהושע of
Natsareth, whom you persecute.’ 
Acts
22:9  “And those who were with me indeed
saw the light and were afraid, but they did not hear His voice speaking to me. 
Acts
22:10  “And I said, ‘What shall I do,
Master?’ And the Master said to me, ‘Rise up, go into Damascus, and there you
shall be told all that you have been appointed to do.’ 
Acts
22:11  “And as I could not see because of
the esteem of that light, being led by the hand of those who were with me, I
came into Damascus. 
Acts
22:12  “And a certain Ḥananyah, a
dedicated man according to the Torah, being well spoken of by all the Yehuḏim
dwelling there,
Acts
22:13  came to me, and stood by and said
to me, ‘Brother Sha’ul, look up.’ And at that same hour I looked up at him. 
Acts
22:14  “And he said, ‘The Elohim of our
fathers has appointed you to know His desire, and to see the Righteous One, and
to hear the voice from His mouth. 
Acts
22:15  ‘Because you shall be His witness
to all men of what you have seen and heard. 
Acts
22:16  ‘And now, why do you delay? Rise
up, be immersed, and wash away your sins, calling on the Name of יהוה.’

Acts
22:17  “And it came to be, when I
returned to Yerushalayim, and while I was praying in the Set-apart Place, I
came to be in a trance, 
Acts
22:18  and I saw Him saying to me, ‘Hurry
and get out of Yerushalayim, speedily, because they shall not accept your
witness concerning Me.’ 
Acts
22:19  “And I said, ‘Master, they know
that in every congregation I was imprisoning and beating those who believe on
You. 
Acts
22:20  ‘And when the blood of Your
witness Stephanos was shed, I also was standing by giving my approval to his
death, and keeping the garments of those who were killing him.’ 
Acts
22:21  “And He said to me, ‘Go, because I
shall send you far from here to the gentiles.’ ” 
Acts
22:22  And they were listening to him
until this word, and then they lifted up their voice, saying, “Away with such a
one from the earth, for it is not fit that he should live!” 
Acts
22:23  As they were shouting and tearing
their garments, and throwing dust into the air, 
Acts
22:24  the commander ordered him to be
brought into the barracks, and said that he should be examined by flogging, in
order to find out why they were shouting so against him. 
Acts
22:25  And as they were stretching him
out with straps, Sha’ul said to the captain who was standing by, “Is it
permitted for you to whip a man who is a Roman, and uncondemned?” 
Acts
22:26  And when the captain heard, he
went and reported to the commander, saying, “Watch what you are about to do,
for this man is a Roman.” 
Acts
22:27  And having come, the commander
said to him, “Say to me, are you a Roman?” And he said, “Yes.” 
Acts
22:28  And the commander answered, “With
a large sum I obtained this citizenship.” And Sha’ul said, “But I was even born
so.” 
Acts
22:29  Then at once those who were about
to examine him withdrew from him. And the commander was also afraid after he
found out that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him. 
Acts
22:30  And on the next day, intending to
know for certain why he was accused by the Yehuḏim, he released him, and
commanded the chief priests and all their council to come, and brought Sha’ul
down and set him before them. 
Acts
23:1  And Sha’ul, looking intently at the
council, said, “Men, brothers, I have lived in all good conscience before
Elohim until this day.” 
Acts
23:2  And the high priest Ḥananyah
commanded those who stood by him to strike him on the mouth. 
Acts
23:3  Then Sha’ul said to him, “Elohim is
going to strike you, whitewashed wall! And do you sit judging me according to
the Torah, and do you command me to be struck contrary to the Torah?” 
Acts
23:4  And those who stood by said, “Do
you revile the high priest of Elohim?” 
Acts
23:5  And Sha’ul said, “I did not know,
brothers, that he was the high priest, for it has been written, ‘You shall not
speak evil of the ruler of your people.’ ” 
Acts
23:6  Now Sha’ul, perceiving that one part
were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, cried out in the council, “Men,
brothers, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee, I am being judged concerning
the expectation and resurrection of the dead!” 
Acts
23:7  And when he had said this, there
came a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees. And the crowd was
divided. 
Acts
23:8  For the Sadducees say that there is
no resurrection, nor messenger nor spirit, but the Pharisees confess both. 
Acts
23:9  And there was a great uproar. And
certain of the scribes of the party of Pharisees were earnestly contending,
saying, “We find no evil in this man. And if a spirit or a messenger has spoken
to him, let us not fight against Elohim.” 
Acts
23:10  And a great dissension having
come, the commander, fearing lest Sha’ul would be pulled to pieces by them,
commanded the body of soldiers to go down and seize him from their midst, and
bring him into the barracks. 
Acts
23:11  And on the following night the
Master stood by him and said, “Take courage, Sha’ul, for as you have witnessed
for Me in Yerushalayim, so you have to bear witness at Rome too.” 
Acts
23:12  And when it became day, some of
the Yehuḏim made a conspiracy and bound themselves under an oath, saying
that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Sha’ul. 
Acts
23:13  And those making this conspiracy
were more than forty, 
Acts
23:14  who, having come to the chief
priests and elders, said, “We have bound ourselves under a great oath not to
eat at all until we have killed Sha’ul. 
Acts
23:15  “Now, then, you, with the council,
inform the commander to have him brought down to you tomorrow, as intending to
examine more exactly all about him. And we are ready to kill him before he
comes near.” 
Acts
23:16  And when Sha’ul’s sister’s son
heard of their ambush, he went and entered into the barracks and reported to
Sha’ul. 
Acts
23:17  And Sha’ul, having called one of
the captains to him, said, “Take this young man to the commander, for he has
somewhat to report to him.” 
Acts
23:18  He indeed then took him and led
him to the commander and said, “The prisoner Sha’ul called me to him and asked
me to bring this young man to you, having somewhat to say to you.” 
Acts
23:19  And the commander, having taken
him by the hand, went aside by themselves and asked, “What is it that you have
to report to me?” 
Acts
23:20  And he said, “The Yehuḏim
have agreed to ask that you bring Sha’ul down to the council tomorrow, as
intending to inquire more exactly about him. 
Acts
23:21  “Therefore, do not let them
persuade you, for more than forty of them lie in wait for him, men who have
bound themselves by an oath neither to eat nor to drink until they have killed
him. And now they are ready, waiting for the promise from you.” 
Acts
23:22  Then the commander dismissed the
young man, having commanded him, “Inform no one that you reported this to me.” 
Acts
23:23  And having called near a certain
two captains, he said, “Get two hundred soldiers ready to go to Caesarea, and
seventy horsemen, and two hundred spearmen, after the third hour of the night, 
Acts
23:24  and provide beasts, on which to
place Sha’ul, and bring him safely to Felix the governor,” 
Acts
23:25  having written a letter in this
form: 
Acts
23:26  Claudius Lysias, to the most
excellent governor Felix: Greetings. 
Acts
23:27  This man, having been seized by
the Yehuḏim, and being about to be killed by them, I rescued, having come
with the body of soldiers, having learned that he was a Roman. 
Acts
23:28  And, desiring to know the reason
they accused him, I brought him before their council. 
Acts
23:29  I found out that he was accused
concerning questions of their Torah, but there was no charge against him
deserving death or chains. 
Acts
23:30  And when I was informed that there
was to be a plot against the man by the Yehuḏim, I sent him immediately
to you, having also commanded his accusers to state before you the charges
against him. Be strong! 
Acts
23:31  So the soldiers, as they were
commanded, took Sha’ul and brought him by night to Antipatris. 
Acts
23:32  And on the next day they left the
horsemen to go on with him, and returned to the barracks, 
Acts
23:33  who, having come to Caesarea, and
delivered the letter to the governor, they also presented Sha’ul to him. 
Acts
23:34  And the governor, having read it,
and having asked of what province he was, and being informed that he was from
Kilikia, 
Acts
23:35  said, “I shall hear you when your
accusers arrive also.” And he commanded him to be kept in Herodes’ palace. 
Acts
24:1  And after five days the high priest
Ḥananyah came down, with the elders, and a certain speaker – Tertullus.
And they brought charges against Sha’ul before the governor. 
Acts
24:2  And when he was called upon,
Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, “Having obtained great peace through
you, and reforms being brought to this nation by your forethought, 
Acts
24:3  we accept it always and in all
places, most excellent Felix, with all thanks. 
Acts
24:4  “But in order not to hinder you any
further, I beg you to hear us briefly in your gentleness. 
Acts
24:5  “For having found this man a
plague, who stirs up dissension among all the Yehuḏim throughout the
world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Natsarenes, 
Acts
24:6  who also tried to profane the
Set-apart Place, and whom we seized, and wished to judge him according to our
law, 
Acts
24:7  but the commander Lysias came along
and with much violence took him out of our hands, 
Acts
24:8  commanding his accusers to come to
you. And by examining him yourself you shall be able to know all these matters of which we accuse him.” 
Acts
24:9  And the Yehuḏim also agreed,
maintaining that these matters were
so. 
Acts
24:10  And when the governor had motioned
him to speak, Sha’ul answered, “Knowing that for many years you have been a
judge of this nation, I gladly defend myself, 
Acts
24:11  seeing you are able to know that
it is not more than twelve days since I went up to Yerushalayim to worship. 
Acts
24:12  “And they neither found me in the
Set-apart Place disputing with anyone nor stirring up the crowd, either in the
congregations or in the city. 
Acts
24:13  “Nor are they able to prove the
charges of which they now accuse me. 
Acts
24:14  “And this I confess to you, that
according to the Way which they call a sect, so I worship the Elohim of my
fathers, believing all that has been written in the Torah and in the Prophets, 
Acts
24:15  having an expectation in Elohim,
which they themselves also wait for, that there is to be a resurrection of the
dead, both of the righteous and the unrighteous. 
Acts
24:16  “And in this I exercise myself to
have a clear conscience toward Elohim and men always. 
Acts
24:17  “And after many years I came to
bring kind deeds to my nation and offerings, 
Acts
24:18  at which time certain Yehuḏim
from Asia found me cleansed in the Set-apart Place, neither with a crowd nor
with disturbance, 
Acts
24:19  who ought to be present before you
to bring charges if they have any matter
against me. 
Acts
24:20  “Or else let these themselves say
if they found any wrongdoing in me while I stood before the council, 
Acts
24:21  other than for this one
declaration which I cried out, standing among them, ‘Concerning the
resurrection of the dead I am being judged by you today.’ ” 
Acts
24:22  And having heard this, having
known more exactly about the Way, Felix put them off, saying, “When Lysias the
commander comes down, I shall decide your case.” 
Acts
24:23  And he ordered the captain to keep
Sha’ul and to have ease, and not to forbid any of his friends to attend to him.

Acts
24:24  And after some days, when Felix
came with his wife Drusilla, who was a female Yehuḏite, he sent for Sha’ul
and heard him concerning the belief in Messiah. 
Acts
24:25  And as he reasoned about
righteousness, and self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix became
frightened and said, “For the present, go. And when I find time I shall send
for you.” 
Acts
24:26  At the same time too he was
anticipating that silver would be given him by Sha’ul, that he might release
him. Therefore he sent for him more often and conversed with him. 
Acts
24:27  But after two years had passed
Porcius Festus succeeded Felix. And wishing to do the Yehuḏim a favour,
Felix left Sha’ul bound. 
Acts
25:1  Festus therefore, having come to
the province, three days later went up from Caesarea to Yerushalayim. 
Acts
25:2  And the high priest and the chief
men of the Yehuḏim informed him against Sha’ul, and they begged him, 
Acts
25:3  asking a favour against him, that
he would send him to Yerushalayim – making a plot along the way to kill him. 
Acts
25:4  Then, indeed, Festus answered that
Sha’ul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself was about to set out
shortly. 
Acts
25:5  “Therefore,” he said, “let those
who have authority among you go down with me and accuse this man, to see if
there is any fault in him.” 
Acts
25:6  And having spent more than ten days
among them, he went down to Caesarea. And on the next day, sitting on the
judgment seat, he commanded Sha’ul to be brought. 
Acts
25:7  And when he had come, the Yehuḏim
who had come down from Yerushalayim stood about, bringing many and heavy
charges against Sha’ul, which they were unable to prove, 
Acts
25:8  while Sha’ul said in his own
defence, “Neither against the Torah of the Yehuḏim, nor against the
Set-apart Place, nor against Caesar did I commit any sin.” 
Acts
25:9  But Festus, wishing to do the Yehuḏim
a favour, answering Sha’ul, said, “Do you wish to go up to Yerushalayim and be
judged before me there concerning these matters?”

Acts
25:10  And Sha’ul said, “I am standing at
Caesar’s judgment seat, where I should be judged. To the Yehuḏim I have
done no wrong, as you know well enough. 
Acts
25:11  “For if indeed I do wrong, or have
committed whatever deserving death, I do not refuse to die. But if there is
none at all in these matters of which
these men accuse me, no one is able to give me up to them. I appeal to Caesar.”

Acts
25:12  Then Festus, having talked with
the council, answered, “You have appealed to Caesar? To Caesar you shall go!” 
Acts
25:13  And certain days having passed,
Sovereign Agrippa and Bernike came to Caesarea to greet Festus. 
Acts
25:14  And when they had spent many days
there, Festus laid Sha’ul’s case before the sovereign, saying, “There is a man
here whom Felix left as a prisoner, 
Acts
25:15  about whom the chief priests and
the elders of the Yehuḏim informed me, when I was in Yerushalayim, asking
for a judgment against him. 
Acts
25:16  “To them I answered, ‘It is not
the Roman practice to give up any man to destruction before the accused meets
the accusers face to face, and has a chance to answer for himself concerning
the charge against him.’ 
Acts
25:17  “They, therefore, having come
together, without any delay, I sat on the judgment seat the next day and
commanded the man to be brought in. 
Acts
25:18  “When the accusers stood up, they
brought no charge against him such as I expected, 
Acts
25:19  but had some questions against him
about their own worship and about a certain יהושע,
who had died, whom Sha’ul was claiming to be alive. 
Acts
25:20  “And being uncertain how to
investigate these matters, I asked whether he wished to go to Yerushalayim and
there be judged concerning these matters. 
Acts
25:21  “But when Sha’ul appealed to be
kept for the decision of Augustus, I ordered him to be kept until I send him to
Caesar.” 
Acts
25:22  And Agrippa said to Festus, “I was
wishing also to hear the man myself.” And he said, “Tomorrow, you shall hear
him.” 
Acts
25:23  Therefore, on the next day,
Agrippa and Bernike having come with great show, and having entered the place
of hearing with the commanders and the eminent men of the city, Sha’ul was
brought in at the order of Festus. 
Acts
25:24  And Festus said, “Sovereign
Agrippa and all the men present here with us, you see this one about whom all
the community of the Yehuḏim pleaded with me, both at Yerushalayim and
here, shouting that he ought not to be living any longer. 
Acts
25:25  “But I, having found that he had
committed none at all deserving death, and that he himself had appealed to
Augustus, I decided to send him. 
Acts
25:26  “I have no definite matter to write to my master concerning
him. Therefore I have brought him out before you, and most of all before you,
Sovereign Agrippa, so that after the examination has taken place I might have
somewhat to write. 
Acts
25:27  “For it seems to me unreasonable
to send a prisoner and not to signify the charges against him.” 
Acts
26:1  And Agrippa said to Sha’ul, “You
are allowed to speak for yourself.” Then Sha’ul stretched out his hand and made
his defence: 
Acts
26:2  “I think myself blessed, Sovereign
Agrippa, because today I shall make my defence before you concerning all of
which I am accused by the Yehuḏim, 
Acts
26:3  you being most of all an expert,
knowing of all practices and questions which have to do with the Yehuḏim.
So, please hear me patiently. 
Acts
26:4  “Truly, then, all the Yehuḏim
know my way of life from youth, which I led from the beginning among my own
nation at Yerushalayim, 
Acts
26:5  since they have known me from the
first, if they wish to witness, that I lived as a Pharisee according to the
strictest sect of our observance. 
Acts
26:6  “And now I stand and am judged for
the expectation of the promise made by Elohim to our fathers, 
Acts
26:7  to which our twelve tribes,
earnestly serving Elohim night and day, expect to attain. Concerning this
expectation, O Sovereign Agrippa, I am accused by the Yehuḏim. 
Acts
26:8  “Why is it considered ‘unbelievable’
among you if Elohim raises the dead? 
Acts
26:9  “Therefore, indeed, I thought
within myself that I ought to do much against the Name of יהושע
of Natsareth, 
Acts
26:10  which also I did in Yerushalayim,
and I shut up many of the set-apart ones in prison, having received authority
from the chief priests. And when they were put to death, I gave my vote against
them. 
Acts
26:11  “And punishing them often in all
the congregations, I compelled them to blaspheme. And being exceedingly enraged
against them, I persecuted them even to foreign cities. 
Acts
26:12  “While thus engaged, as I was
journeying to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests, 
Acts
26:13  at midday along the highway, O
sovereign, I saw a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, shining around me
and those who journeyed with me. 
Acts
26:14  “And when we had all fallen to the
ground, I heard a voice speaking to me, and saying in the Heḇrew
language, ‘Sha’ul, Sha’ul, why do you persecute Me? It is hard for you to kick
against the prods.’
Acts
26:15  “And I said, ‘Who are You, Master?’
And He said, ‘I am יהושע, whom you persecute. 
Acts
26:16  ‘But rise up, and stand on your
feet, for I have appeared to you for this purpose, to appoint you a servant and
a witness both of what you saw and of those which I shall reveal to you, 
Acts
26:17  delivering you from the people,
and the gentiles, to whom I now send you, 
Acts
26:18  to open their eyes, to turn them
from darkness to light, and the authority of Satan to Elohim, in order for them
to receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who are set-apart
by belief in Me.’
Acts
26:19  “Therefore, Sovereign Agrippa, I
was not disobedient to the heavenly vision, 
Acts
26:20  but declared first to those in
Damascus and in Yerushalayim, and in all the country of Yehuḏah, and to
the gentiles, that they should repent, and turn to Elohim, and do works worthy
of repentance.
Acts
26:21  “That is why the Yehuḏim
seized me in the Set-apart Place and tried to kill me. 
Acts
26:22  “Therefore, having obtained help
from Elohim, to this day I stand, witnessing both to small and great, saying
nil else than what the prophets and Mosheh said would come – 
Acts
26:23  that the Messiah would suffer,
would be the first to rise from the dead, He would proclaim light to the people
and to the gentiles.” 
Acts
26:24  And while saying this in his
defence, Festus said with a loud voice, “Sha’ul, you are mad! Much learning is
turning you to madness!” 
Acts
26:25  But Sha’ul said, “I am not mad,
most excellent Festus, but I speak words of truth and sense. 
Acts
26:26  “For the sovereign, before whom I
also speak boldly, knows these matters.
For I am persuaded that none of these are hidden from him, for this has not
been done in a corner. 
Acts
26:27  “Sovereign Agrippa, do you believe
the prophets? I know that you do believe.” 
Acts
26:28  And Agrippa said to Sha’ul, “With
a little you might persuade me to become a Messianite!” 
Acts
26:29  And Sha’ul said, “Much or little,
I pray to Elohim that not only you, but also all who hear me today, might
become such as I also am, except for these chains.” 
Acts
26:30  And having said this, the
sovereign stood up, as well as the governor and Bernike and those sitting with
them, 
Acts
26:31  and having withdrawn, they spoke
to each other, saying, “This man is doing none at all deserving death or
chains.” 
Acts
26:32  And Agrippa said to Festus, “This
man could have been released if he had not appealed to Caesar.” 
Acts
27:1  And when it was decided that we
should sail to Italy, they delivered Sha’ul and some other prisoners to one
named Julius, a captain of the Augustan regiment. 
Acts
27:2  And having embarked in a ship from
Adramyttium, about to sail along the coasts of Asia, did set sail. Aristarchos,
a Makedonian of Thessalonike, was with us. 
Acts
27:3  And on the next day we landed at
Tsiḏon. And Julius treated Sha’ul kindly and allowed him to go to his
friends to receive attention. 
Acts
27:4  And from there we put out to sea
and sailed close to Cyprus, because the winds were against us. 
Acts
27:5  And having sailed over the sea
along Kilikia and Pamphulia, we came to Mura, of Lukia. 
Acts
27:6  And there the captain, having found
an Alexandrian ship sailing to Italy, did put us on board. 
Acts
27:7  And having sailed slowly many days,
and arriving with difficulty off Knidos, the wind not allowing us to proceed,
we sailed close to Crete, off Salmone. 
Acts
27:8  And passing it with difficulty, we
came to a place called Fair Havens, near the city of Lasea. 
Acts
27:9  And much time having passed, and
the sailing now being dangerous, because the Fast was already over, Sha’ul
advised them, 
Acts
27:10  saying, “Men, I see that this
voyage is going to end with damage and great loss, not only of the cargo and
ship, but also our lives.” 
Acts
27:11  But the captain was persuaded by
the pilot and the owner of the ship, rather than what Sha’ul said. 
Acts
27:12  And because the harbour was
unsuitable to winter in, the greater part advised to set sail from there too,
if somehow they were able to reach Phoenix, a harbour of Crete facing southwest
and northwest, to pass the winter. 
Acts
27:13  And a south wind blowing softly,
thinking they had obtained their purpose, having lifted anchor, they sailed along Crete, close inshore. 
Acts
27:14  And not long after, a stormy head
wind rushed down from it, called Northeaster. 
Acts
27:15  And when the ship was caught in it, and unable to head against the
wind, we let her go and were driven. 
Acts
27:16  And having run under a small
island called Klauda, we were hardly able to control the small boat. 
Acts
27:17  And having hoisted it, they used
helps to undergird the ship. And fearing lest they should run aground on
Surtis, they lowered the tackle and so were driven. 
Acts
27:18  And because we were exceedingly
storm-tossed, the next day they began to throw overboard. 
Acts
27:19  And on the third day we threw out
the ship’s tackle with our own hands. 
Acts
27:20  When, now, neither sun nor stars
appeared for many days, and no small storm beat on us, all expectancy that we
would be saved was taken away. 
Acts
27:21  And when there had been a long
abstinence from food, then Sha’ul, standing in the midst of them, said, “Truly,
men, you should have listened to me not to have sailed from Crete and sustained
this damage and loss. 
Acts
27:22  “And now I urge you to take
courage, for there shall be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship. 
Acts
27:23  “For tonight a messenger of the
Elohim to whom I belong and whom I serve, stood by me,
Acts
27:24  saying, ‘Do not be afraid, Sha’ul,
you have to be brought before Caesar. And look, Elohim has favourably given you
all those who sail with you.’ 
Acts
27:25  “Therefore take courage, men, for
I believe Elohim that it shall be according to the way it was spoken to me. 
Acts
27:26  “However, we need to run aground
on some island.” 
Acts
27:27  And when the fourteenth night
came, as we were driven up and down in the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the
sailors suspected that they were drawing near some land. 
Acts
27:28  So, taking soundings, they found
it to be twenty fathoms. And a little farther on they took soundings again and
found it to be fifteen fathoms. 
Acts
27:29  And, fearing lest we should run
aground on the rocks, they dropped four anchors from the stern, and were
praying for day to come. 
Acts
27:30  But when the sailors were seeking
to escape from the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under
pretence of going to cast out anchors from the prow, 
Acts
27:31  Sha’ul said to the captain and the
soldiers, “If these do not remain in the ship, it is impossible for you to be
saved.” 
Acts
27:32  Then the soldiers did cut the
ropes of the boat and let it fall off. 
Acts
27:33  And when day was about to come,
Sha’ul urged them all to take food, saying, “Today is the fourteenth day you
have continued without food, and eaten none at all. 
Acts
27:34  “So I urge you to take food, for
this concerns your safety, since not a hair shall fall from the head of any of
you.” 
Acts
27:35  And having said this, he took
bread and gave thanks to Elohim in the presence of them all. And when he had
broken it he began to eat. 
Acts
27:36  And they were all encouraged, and
also took food themselves. 
Acts
27:37  And all of us were two hundred and
seventy-six beings in the ship. 
Acts
27:38  And being satisfied with food,
they were lightening the ship, throwing out the wheat into the sea. 
Acts
27:39  And when day came, they did not
recognise the land, but they noted a certain bay with a beach, onto which they
planned to run the ship if possible. 
Acts
27:40  And having cast off the anchors,
they left them in the sea, meanwhile untying the rudder ropes. And they hoisted
the foresail to the wind and made for the beach. 
Acts
27:41  But coming upon a place where two
seas met, they grounded the ship, and the prow stuck fast and remained
immovable, but the stern was broken by the pounding of the surf. 
Acts
27:42  And the soldiers intended to kill
the prisoners, lest any of them should swim away and escape. 
Acts
27:43  But the captain, intending to save
Sha’ul, kept them from their intention, and commanded those able to swim to
jump first and get to land, 
Acts
27:44  and the rest, some indeed on
boards, and some on items of the
ship. And so it came to be that all reached the land in safety. 
Acts
28:1  And having come to safety, they
then learned that the island was called Melite. 
Acts
28:2  And the foreigners showed us
extraordinary kindness, for they kindled a fire and received us all, because of
the rain that was falling and because of the cold. 
Acts
28:3  But Sha’ul, having gathered a
bundle of sticks, and having laid them on the fire, an adder came out because
of the heat, and fastened itself on his hand. 
Acts
28:4  And when the foreigners saw the
creature hanging from his hand, they said to each other, “This man is certainly
a murderer, whom, though saved from the sea, still right-ruling does not allow
to live.” 
Acts
28:5  Then, indeed, he shook off the
creature into the fire and suffered no evil. 
Acts
28:6  And expecting that he would swell
up or suddenly fall down dead, they waited for a long time and saw no harm come
to him, changing their minds they said that he was a mighty one. 
Acts
28:7  And in the neighbourhood of that
place there were lands of the chief of the island, whose name was Poplius, who
received us and housed us in a friendly way for three days. 
Acts
28:8  And it came to be that the father
of Poplius lay sick with inflammation and dysentery. Sha’ul went in to him, and
having prayed he laid his hands on him and healed him. 
Acts
28:9  And when this took place, the rest
of those on the island who had diseases also came and were healed, 
Acts
28:10  who also respected us in many
ways. And when we were setting sail, they provided us with our needs. 
Acts
28:11  And after three months we set sail
in an Alexandrian ship which had wintered at the island, and whose figurehead
was “Twin Brothers.”
Acts
28:12  And having landed at Syracuse, we
stayed three days, 
Acts
28:13  from which place we went round and
arrived at Rhegium. And after one day the south wind blew, and the second day
we came to Puteoli, 
Acts
28:14  where we found brothers, and were
invited to stay with them seven days. And so we went toward Rome. 
Acts
28:15  And when the brothers there heard
about us, they came to meet us as far as Forum of Appius and Three Taverns.
When Sha’ul saw them, he thanked Elohim and took courage. 
Acts
28:16  And when we came to Rome, the
captain delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard, but Sha’ul was
allowed to stay by himself with the soldier guarding him. 
Acts
28:17  And it came to be after three days
that Sha’ul called the leaders of the Yehuḏim together. And when they had
come together, he said to them, “Men, brothers, though I have done none at all
against our people or the practices of our fathers, I was delivered as a
prisoner from Yerushalayim into the hands of the Romans, 
Acts
28:18  who, when they had examined me,
intended to let me go, because there was no cause for putting me to death. 
Acts
28:19  “But the Yehuḏim spoke
against it, and I was compelled to appeal to Caesar, not that I had any
accusation against my nation. 
Acts
28:20  “This therefore is the reason I
called for you, to see you and speak with you. It is because of the expectation
of Yisra’ĕl that I am bound with this chain.” 
Acts
28:21  And they said to him, “We neither
received letters from Yehuḏah concerning you, nor have any of the
brothers who came reported or spoken whatever wicked about you. 
Acts
28:22  “And we think it right to hear
from you what you think, for indeed, concerning this sect, we know that it is
spoken against everywhere.” 
Acts
28:23  And having appointed him a day,
many came to him where he was staying, to whom he was explaining, earnestly
witnessing about the reign of Elohim, and persuading them concerning יהושע
from both the Torah of Mosheh and the Prophets, from morning until evening. 
Acts
28:24  And some indeed were persuaded by
what was said, but some believed not. 
Acts
28:25  And disagreeing with one another,
they began to leave, after Sha’ul had spoken one word, “The Set-apart Spirit
rightly spoke through Yeshayahu the prophet to our fathers, 
Acts
28:26  saying, ‘Go to this people and
say, “Hearing you shall hear but by no means understand, and seeing you shall
see but by no means perceive, 
Acts
28:27  for the heart of this people has
become thickened, and with their ears they heard heavily, and they have closed
their eyes, lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears, and
understand with their heart, and turn back, and I should heal them.” ’
Acts
28:28  “Therefore let it be known to you
that the deliverance of Elohim has been sent to the gentiles, and they shall
hear!” 
Acts
28:29  And when he had said these words,
the Yehuḏim went away and had a great dispute among themselves. 
Acts
28:30  And Sha’ul stayed two entire years
in his own rented house, and was receiving all who came to him, 
Acts
28:31  proclaiming the reign of Elohim
and teaching about the Master יהושע Messiah with
all boldness, unhindered.
