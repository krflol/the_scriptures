Wayyiqra/Leviticus
Lev
1:1  And יהוה
called to Mosheh, and spoke to him from the Tent of Meeting, saying, 
Lev
1:2  “Speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl,
and say to them, ‘When anyone of you brings an offering to יהוה,
you bring your offering of the livestock, of the herd or of the flock. 
Lev
1:3  ‘If his offering is a burnt offering
of the herd, let him bring a male, a perfect one. Let him bring it at the door
of the Tent of Meeting, for his acceptance before יהוה.

Lev
1:4  ‘And he shall lay his hand on the
head of the burnt offering, and it shall be accepted on his behalf to make
atonement for him. 
Lev
1:5  ‘And he shall slaughter the bull
before יהוה. And the sons of Aharon, the priests, shall
bring the blood and sprinkle the blood all around on the altar which is at the
door of the Tent of Meeting. 
Lev
1:6  ‘And he shall skin the burnt
offering and cut it into its pieces. 
Lev
1:7  ‘And the sons of Aharon the priest
shall put fire on the altar, and lay the wood in order on the fire. 
Lev
1:8  ‘And the sons of Aharon, the
priests, shall arrange the pieces, with the head and the fat on the wood which
is on the fire on the altar. 
Lev
1:9  ‘But its entrails and its legs he
washes with water. And the priest shall burn all of it on the altar as a burnt
offering, an offering made by fire, a sweet fragrance to יהוה.

Lev
1:10  ‘And if his offering is from the
flock, from the sheep or from the goats as a burnt offering, let him bring a
male, a perfect one. 
Lev
1:11  ‘And he shall slaughter it on the
north side of the altar before יהוה. And the sons of
Aharon, the priests, shall sprinkle its blood on the altar all around. 
Lev
1:12  ‘And he shall cut it into its
pieces, with its head and its fat, and the priest shall arrange them on the
wood which is on the fire on the altar. 
Lev
1:13  ‘But the entrails and the legs he
washes with water. And the priest shall bring it all and burn it on the altar.
It is a burnt offering, an offering made by fire, a sweet fragrance to יהוה.

Lev
1:14  ‘And if the burnt offering of his
offering to יהוה is of birds, then he shall bring his
offering of turtledoves or young pigeons. 
Lev
1:15  ‘And the priest shall bring it to
the altar, and shall wring off its head, and burn it on the altar, and its
blood shall be drained out at the side of the altar. 
Lev
1:16  ‘And he shall remove its crop with
its feathers and throw it beside the altar on the east side, into the place for
ashes. 
Lev
1:17  ‘And he shall split it at its
wings, but not sever it. And the priest shall burn it on the altar, on the wood
that is on the fire. It is a burnt offering, an offering made by fire, a sweet
fragrance to יהוה. 
Lev
2:1  ‘And when anyone brings a grain
offering to יהוה, his offering is to be of fine flour.
And he shall pour oil on it, and put frankincense on it, 
Lev
2:2  and he shall bring it to the sons of
Aharon, the priests, and he shall take from it his hand filled with fine flour
and oil with all the frankincense. And the priest shall burn it as a
remembrance portion on the altar, an offering made by fire, a sweet fragrance
to יהוה. 
Lev
2:3  ‘And the rest of the grain offering
is for Aharon and his sons, most set-apart of the offerings to יהוה
by fire. 
Lev
2:4  ‘And when you bring as an offering a
grain offering baked in the oven, it is
of unleavened cakes of fine flour mixed with oil, or unleavened thin cakes
anointed with oil. 
Lev
2:5  ‘But if your offering is a grain
offering on the griddle, it is of fine flour, unleavened, mixed with oil. 
Lev
2:6  ‘Divide it into bits and pour oil on
it, it is a grain offering. 
Lev
2:7  ‘And if your offering is a grain
offering, in a stewing-pot, it is made of fine flour with oil. 
Lev
2:8  ‘And you shall bring to יהוה
the grain offering that is made of these, and shall present it to the priest,
and he shall bring it to the altar. 
Lev
2:9  ‘And the priest shall take from the
grain offering a remembrance portion, and burn it on the altar, an offering
made by fire, a sweet fragrance to יהוה. 
Lev
2:10  ‘And the rest of the grain offering
is for Aharon and his sons, most set-apart of the offerings to יהוה
made by fire. 
Lev
2:11  ‘No grain offering which you bring
to יהוה is made with leaven, for you do not burn any
leaven or any honey in an offering to יהוה made by
fire. 
Lev
2:12  ‘Bring them to יהוה
as an offering of the first-fruits, but they are not burned on the altar for a
sweet fragrance. 
Lev
2:13  ‘And season with salt every
offering of your grain offering, and do not allow the salt of the covenant of
your Elohim to be lacking from your grain offering. With all your offerings you
bring salt. 
Lev
2:14  ‘And if you bring a grain offering
of your first-fruits to יהוה, bring for the grain
offering of your first-fruits green heads of grain roasted on the fire, crushed
heads of new grain. 
Lev
2:15  ‘And you shall put oil on it, and
lay frankincense on it. It is a grain offering. 
Lev
2:16  ‘And the priest shall burn the
remembrance portion, from its crushed grain and from its oil, with all the
frankincense, an offering made by fire to יהוה. 
Lev
3:1  ‘And if that which he presents is a
peace offering, if he is bringing it of the herd, whether male or female, he
brings a perfect one before יהוה. 
Lev
3:2  ‘And he shall lay his hand on the
head of his offering, and slaughter it at the door of the Tent of Meeting. And
the sons of Aharon, the priests, shall sprinkle the blood on the altar all
around. 
Lev
3:3  ‘And from the peace offering he
shall bring an offering made by fire to יהוה, the fat
that covers the entrails and all the fat that is on the entrails, 
Lev
3:4  and the two kidneys, and the fat
that is on them by the loins, and the appendage on the liver which he removes
with the kidneys. 
Lev
3:5  ‘And the sons of Aharon shall burn
it on the altar upon the burnt offering, which is on the wood, which is on the
fire, as an offering made by fire, a sweet fragrance to יהוה.

Lev
3:6  ‘And if that which he presents is
from the flock, for a peace offering to יהוה, male or
female, he brings a perfect one. 
Lev
3:7  ‘If he is bringing a lamb as his
offering, then he shall bring it before יהוה, 
Lev
3:8  and shall lay his hand on the head
of his offering, and slaughter it in front of the Tent of Meeting, and the sons
of Aharon shall sprinkle its blood on the altar round about. 
Lev
3:9  ‘And from the peace offering he
shall bring near – as an offering made by fire to יהוה –
its fat, all the fat tail which he removes close to the backbone, and the fat
that covers the entrails and all the fat that is on the entrails, 
Lev
3:10  and the two kidneys and the fat
that is on them by the loins, and the appendage on the liver, which he removes
with the kidneys. 
Lev
3:11  ‘And the priest shall burn them on
the altar as food, an offering made by fire to יהוה. 
Lev
3:12  ‘And if his offering is a goat,
then he shall bring it before יהוה, 
Lev
3:13  and shall lay his hand on its head
and slaughter it before the Tent of Meeting. And the sons of Aharon shall
sprinkle its blood on the altar all around. 
Lev
3:14  ‘And from it he shall bring his
offering, as an offering made by fire to יהוה, the fat
that covers the entrails and all the fat that is on the entrails, 
Lev
3:15  and the two kidneys and the fat
that is on them by the loins, and the appendage on the liver, which he removes
with the kidneys. 
Lev
3:16  ‘And the priest shall burn them on
the altar as food, an offering made by fire for a sweet fragrance. All the fat
belongs to יהוה. 
Lev
3:17  ‘An everlasting law throughout your
generations in all your dwellings: you do not eat any fat or any blood.’ ” 
Lev
4:1  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying,
Lev
4:2  “Speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl,
saying, ‘When a being sins by mistake against any of the commands of יהוה,
which are not to be done, and shall do any of them: 
Lev
4:3  ‘If the anointed priest sins,
bringing guilt on the people, then he shall bring to יהוה
for his sin which he has sinned a young bull, a perfect one, as a sin offering,

Lev
4:4  and he shall bring the bull to the
door of the Tent of Meeting before יהוה, and shall lay
his hand on the bull’s head, and slaughter the bull before יהוה.

Lev
4:5  ‘And the anointed priest shall take
some of the bull’s blood and bring it to the Tent of Meeting, 
Lev
4:6  and the priest shall dip his finger
in the blood and sprinkle some of the blood seven times before יהוה,
in front of the veil of the set-apart place. 
Lev
4:7  ‘And the priest shall put some of
the blood on the horns of the altar of sweet incense before יהוה,
which is in the Tent of Meeting, and pour all the blood of the bull at the base
of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the Tent of
Meeting. 
Lev
4:8  ‘Then he takes all the fat of the
bull as the sin offering, the fat that covers the entrails and all the fat
which is on the entrails, 
Lev
4:9  and the two kidneys and the fat that
is on them by the loins, and the appendage on the liver, which he removes with
the kidneys, 
Lev
4:10  as it was taken from the bull of
the peace offering. And the priest shall burn them on the altar of the burnt
offering. 
Lev
4:11  ‘But the skin of the bull, and all
its flesh, with its head and legs, its entrails and dung – 
Lev
4:12  all of the bull – he shall bring
outside the camp to a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn it
on wood with fire. Where the ashes are poured out it is burned. 
Lev
4:13  ‘And if the entire congregation of
Yisra’ĕl strays by mistake, and the matter has been hidden from the eyes
of the assembly, and they have done against
any of the commands of יהוה, which are not to be done,
and shall be guilty, 
Lev
4:14  when the sin which they have sinned
becomes known, then the assembly shall bring a young bull for the sin, and
bring it before the Tent of Meeting. 
Lev
4:15  ‘And the elders of the congregation
shall lay their hands on the head of the bull before יהוה,
and the bull shall be slaughtered before יהוה. 
Lev
4:16  ‘And the anointed priest shall
bring some of the bull’s blood to the Tent of Meeting, 
Lev
4:17  and the priest shall dip his finger
in the blood and sprinkle it seven times before יהוה,
in front of the veil, 
Lev
4:18  and put some of the blood on the
horns of the altar which is before יהוה, which is in
the Tent of Meeting, and pour all the blood at the base of the altar of burnt
offering, which is at the door of the Tent of Meeting. 
Lev
4:19  ‘Then he takes all the fat from it
and shall burn it on the altar. 
Lev
4:20  ‘And he shall do with the bull as
he did with the bull as a sin offering – so shall he do it. And the priest
shall make atonement for them, and it shall be forgiven them. 
Lev
4:21  ‘And he shall bring the bull
outside the camp, and burn it as he burned the first bull. It is a sin offering
for the assembly. 
Lev
4:22  ‘When a ruler sins, and by mistake
has done against any of the commands
of יהוה his Elohim which are not to be done, and shall
be guilty, 
Lev
4:23  or if his sin which he has sinned
is made known to him, then he shall bring as his offering a buck of the goats,
a male, a perfect one. 
Lev
4:24  ‘And he shall lay his hand on the
head of the goat, and slaughter it at the place where they slaughter the burnt
offering before יהוה. It is a sin offering. 
Lev
4:25  ‘And the priest shall take some of
the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and shall put it on the horns of
the altar of burnt offering, and pour its blood at the base of the altar of
burnt offering, 
Lev
4:26  and burn all its fat on the altar,
like the fat of the slaughtering of the peace offering. And the priest shall
make atonement for him for his sin, and it shall be forgiven him. 
Lev
4:27  ‘And if any being of the people of
the land sins by mistake by doing against
any of the commands of יהוה which are not to be done,
and shall be guilty, 
Lev
4:28  or if his sin which he has sinned
shall be made known to him, then he shall bring as his offering a female goat,
a perfect one, for his sin which he has sinned. 
Lev
4:29  ‘And he shall lay his hand on the
head of the sin offering, and slaughter the sin offering at the place of the
burnt offering. 
Lev
4:30  ‘And the priest shall take some of
its blood with his finger, and shall put it on the horns of the altar of burnt
offering, and pour all the blood at the base of the altar, 
Lev
4:31  then remove all its fat, as fat is
removed from the slaughtering of the peace offering. And the priest shall burn
it on the altar for a sweet fragrance to יהוה. And the
priest shall make atonement for him, and it shall be forgiven him. 
Lev
4:32  ‘And if he brings a lamb as his sin
offering, he brings a female, a perfect one. 
Lev
4:33  ‘And he shall lay his hand on the
head of the sin offering, and slaughter it as a sin offering at the place where
they slaughter the burnt offering. 
Lev
4:34  ‘And the priest shall take some of
the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and shall put it on the horns of
the altar of burnt offering, and pour all the blood at the base of the altar. 
Lev
4:35  ‘Then he removes all its fat, as
the fat of the lamb is removed from the slaughtering of the peace offering. And
the priest shall burn it on the altar, according to the offerings made by fire
to יהוה. So the priest shall make atonement for his sin
that he has sinned, and it shall be forgiven him. 
Lev
5:1  ‘And when a being sins in that he
has heard the voice of swearing, and is a witness, or has seen, or has known,
but does not reveal it, he shall bear his crookedness. 
Lev
5:2  ‘Or when a being touches any unclean
matter, or the carcass of an unclean beast, or the carcass of unclean
livestock, or the carcass of unclean creeping creatures, and it has been hidden
from him, he is unclean and guilty. 
Lev
5:3  ‘Or when he touches uncleanness of
man, any of his uncleanness by which he is unclean, and it has been hidden from
him, when he shall know it, then he shall be guilty. 
Lev
5:4  ‘Or when a being swears, speaking
rashly with his lips to do evil or to do good, whatever it is that a man swears
rashly with an oath, and it has been hidden from him, when he shall know it,
then he shall be guilty of one of these. 
Lev
5:5  ‘And it shall be, when he is guilty
of one of these, that he shall confess that in which he has sinned, 
Lev
5:6  and shall bring his guilt offering
to יהוה for his sin which he has sinned, a female from
the flock, a lamb or a female goat as a sin offering. And the priest shall make
atonement for him, for his sin. 
Lev
5:7  ‘And if he is unable to bring a
lamb, then he shall bring to יהוה, he who has sinned,
two turtledoves or two young pigeons, one for a sin offering and the other for
a burnt offering. 
Lev
5:8  ‘And he shall bring them to the
priest, who shall bring near that which is for the sin offering first, and
wring off its head from its neck, but not sever it. 
Lev
5:9  ‘And he shall sprinkle some of the
blood of the sin offering on the side of the altar, and the rest of the blood
shall be drained out at the base of the altar. It is a sin offering. 
Lev
5:10  ‘And he shall prepare the second as
a burnt offering according to the right-ruling, and the priest shall make
atonement for him, for his sin which he has sinned, and it shall be forgiven
him. 
Lev
5:11  ‘But if he is unable to bring two
turtledoves or two young pigeons, then he who sinned shall bring for his
offering one-tenth of an ĕphah of fine flour as a sin offering. He puts no
oil on it, nor does he put any frankincense on it, for it is a sin offering. 
Lev
5:12  ‘And he shall bring it to the
priest, and the priest shall take his hand filled with it as a remembrance
portion, and burn it on the altar according to the offerings made by fire to יהוה.
It is a sin offering. 
Lev
5:13  ‘And the priest shall make
atonement for him, for his sin that he has sinned in any of these, and it shall
be forgiven him. And it shall be the priest’s, like a grain offering.’ ” 
Lev
5:14  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying, 
Lev
5:15  “When a being commits a trespass,
and has sinned by mistake against the set-apart matters of יהוה,
then he shall bring to יהוה as his guilt offering a
ram, a perfect one, from the flock, with your valuation in sheqels of silver
according to the sheqel of the set-apart place, as a guilt offering. 
Lev
5:16  “And he shall make good for the sin
that he has done against that which is set-apart, and shall add one-fifth to it
and give it to the priest. And the priest shall make atonement for him with the
ram of the guilt offering, and it shall be forgiven him. 
Lev
5:17  “And when any being sins, and has
done what is not to be done, against
any of the commands of יהוה, though he knew it not, yet
he shall be guilty and shall bear his crookedness. 
Lev
5:18  “Then he shall bring to the priest
a ram, a perfect one, from the flock, with your valuation, as a guilt offering.
And the priest shall make atonement for his mistake he committed
unintentionally, though he did not know it, and it shall be forgiven him –  
Lev
5:19  it is a guilt offering, he was
truly guilty before יהוה.” 
Lev
6:1  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying,
Lev
6:2  “When any being sins, and committed
a trespass against יהוה, and has lied to his neighbour
about a deposit, or about a pledge, or about a robbery, or shall extort from
his neighbour, 
Lev
6:3  or has found what was lost and has
lied concerning it, or did swear falsely, so that he sins in regard to any one
of all these that a man does, 
Lev
6:4  then it shall be, when he sins, and
shall be guilty, that he shall return what he took by robbery, or what he has
extorted, or the deposit which was deposited with him, or the lost item which
he found, 
Lev
6:5  or all that about which he swore
falsely. He shall repay its total value, add one-fifth more to it, and give it
to whom it belongs, on the day of his guilt offering. 
Lev
6:6  “Then he brings his guilt offering
to יהוה, a ram, a perfect one, from the flock, with
your valuation, as a guilt offering, to the priest. 
Lev
6:7  “And the priest shall make atonement
for him before יהוה, and he shall be forgiven for
whatever he did that made him guilty.” 
Lev
6:8  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying, 
Lev
6:9  “Command Aharon and his sons,
saying, ‘This is the Torah of the burnt offering: This is the burnt offering,
because it is burned on the altar all night until morning, and the fire of the
altar is kept burning on it. 
Lev
6:10  ‘And the priest shall put on his
linen garment, and put his linen trousers on his body, and shall take up the
ashes of the burnt offering which the fire has consumed on the altar, and shall
put them beside the altar. 
Lev
6:11  ‘And he shall take off his
garments, and put on other garments, and shall bring the ashes outside the camp
to a clean place. 
Lev
6:12  ‘And the fire on the altar is kept
burning on it, it is not put out. And the priest shall burn wood on it every
morning, and arrange the burnt offering on it, and shall burn on it the fat of
the peace offerings – 
Lev
6:13  fire is continually kept burning on
the altar, it is not put out. 
Lev
6:14  ‘And this is the Torah of the grain
offering: The sons of Aharon shall bring it near before יהוה,
in front of the altar, 
Lev
6:15  and shall take from it with his
hand from the fine flour of the grain offering, and from its oil, and all the
frankincense which is on the grain offering, and shall burn it on the altar for
a sweet fragrance, as its remembrance portion to יהוה. 
Lev
6:16  ‘Then Aharon and his sons eat the
rest of it. It is eaten with unleavened bread, in the set-apart place. They eat
it in the courtyard of the Tent of Meeting. 
Lev
6:17  ‘It is not baked with leaven. I
have given it to them as their portion of My offerings made by fire, it is most
set-apart, like the sin offering and the guilt offering. 
Lev
6:18  ‘All the males among the children
of Aharon eat it – a law forever in your generations concerning the offerings
made by fire to יהוה. All that touches them is to be
set-apart.’ ” 
Lev
6:19  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying, 
Lev
6:20  “This is the offering of Aharon and
his sons, which they bring near to יהוה, beginning on
the day when he is anointed: one-tenth of an ĕphah of fine flour as a
daily grain offering, half of it in the morning and half of it at night. 
Lev
6:21  “It is made on a griddle with oil.
Bring it in mixed, bring the baked portions of the grain offering near, a sweet
fragrance to יהוה. 
Lev
6:22  “And the anointed priest from among
his sons, who is in his place, prepares it – a law forever to יהוה.
All of it has to be burned, 
Lev
6:23  and every grain offering for the
priest is completely burned, it is not eaten.” 
Lev
6:24  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying, 
Lev
6:25  “Speak to Aharon and to his sons,
saying, ‘This is the Torah of the sin offering: In the place where the burnt
offering is slaughtered, the sin offering is slaughtered before יהוה,
it is most set-apart. 
Lev
6:26  ‘The priest who is making atonement
eats it, in the set-apart place it is eaten, in the courtyard of the Tent of
Meeting. 
Lev
6:27  ‘All that touches its flesh is to
be set-apart. And when its blood is sprinkled on any garment, you wash that on
which it was sprinkled, in a set-apart place. 
Lev
6:28  ‘But the earthen vessel in which it
is cooked is to be broken. And if it is cooked in a bronze pot, then it is
scoured and rinsed in water. 
Lev
6:29  ‘Every male among the priests eats
it, it is most set-apart. 
Lev
6:30  ‘And no sin offering from which any
of the blood is brought into the Tent of Meeting, to make atonement in the
set-apart place, is eaten, it is burned with fire. 
Lev
7:1  ‘And this is the Torah of the guilt
offering – it is most set-apart. 
Lev
7:2  ‘The guilt offering is slaughtered
in the place where they slaughter the burnt offering, and its blood is
sprinkled on the altar all around. 
Lev
7:3  ‘Then he brings from it all its fat:
the fat tail and the fat that covers the entrails, 
Lev
7:4  and the two kidneys and the fat that
is on them by the loins, and the appendage on the liver, which he removes with
the kidneys. 
Lev
7:5  ‘And the priest shall burn them on
the altar as an offering made by fire to יהוה. It is a
guilt offering. 
Lev
7:6  ‘Every male among the priests eats
it. It is eaten in the set-apart place, it is most set-apart. 
Lev
7:7  ‘The guilt offering is like the sin
offering, there is one Torah for them both: the priest who makes atonement with
it, it is his. 
Lev
7:8  ‘And the priest who brings anyone’s
burnt offering, the skin of the burnt offering which he has brought is the
priest’s, it is his. 
Lev
7:9  ‘And every grain offering that is
baked in the oven and all that is prepared in the stewing-pot, or on a griddle,
is the priest’s who brings it, it is his. 
Lev
7:10  ‘And every grain offering mixed
with oil, or dry, is for all the sons of Aharon, for all alike. 
Lev
7:11  ‘And this is the Torah of the
slaughtering of peace offerings which is brought to יהוה
: 
Lev
7:12  ‘If he brings it for a
thanksgiving, then he shall bring with the slaughtering of thanksgiving
unleavened cakes mixed with oil, and unleavened thin cakes anointed with oil,
or cakes of finely blended flour mixed with oil. 
Lev
7:13  ‘Besides the cakes, he brings as
his offering leavened bread together with the slaughtering of thanksgiving of
his peace offering. 
Lev
7:14  ‘And from it he shall bring one
cake from each offering as a contribution to יהוה : to
the priest who sprinkles the blood of the peace offering, it is his. 
Lev
7:15  ‘As for the flesh of the
slaughtering of his peace offering for thanksgiving, it is eaten the same day
it is offered, he does not leave any of it until morning. 
Lev
7:16  ‘And if the offering he brings is a
vow or a voluntary offering, it is eaten the same day that he brings his
slaughtering, and what is left of it is eaten the next day, 
Lev
7:17  but whatever is left of the flesh
of the slaughtering on the third day is burned with fire. 
Lev
7:18  ‘However, if any of the flesh of
his peace offering is eaten at all on the third day, it is not accepted. It is
not reckoned to him who brings it, it is unclean to him, and the being who eats
of it bears his crookedness. 
Lev
7:19  ‘And the flesh that touches that
which is unclean is not eaten, it is burned with fire. And as for the clean
flesh, all who are clean eat of it. 
Lev
7:20  ‘But the being who eats the flesh
of the peace offering that belongs to יהוה, while he is
unclean, that being shall be cut off from his people. 
Lev
7:21  ‘And when a being who touches that
which is unclean, of the uncleanness of man, or of the uncleanness of beast, or
of any unclean swarming creature, and shall eat the flesh of the peace offering
that belongs to יהוה, that being shall be cut off from
his people.’ ” 
Lev
7:22  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying, 
Lev
7:23  “Speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl,
saying, ‘Do not eat any fat, of bull or sheep or goat. 
Lev
7:24  ‘And the fat of a dead body, and
the fat of what is torn, is used for any purpose, but you do not eat it at all.

Lev
7:25  ‘For whoever eats the fat of the
beast of which men bring as an offering made by fire to יהוה,
even the being who eats it shall be cut off from his people. 
Lev
7:26  ‘And do not eat any blood in any of
your dwellings, of bird or of beast. 
Lev
7:27  ‘Any being who eats any blood, even
that being shall be cut off from his people.’ ” 
Lev
7:28  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying, 
Lev
7:29  “Speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl,
saying, ‘He who brings his peace offering to יהוה
brings his offering to יהוה from the slaughtering of
his peace offering. 
Lev
7:30  ‘With his own hands he bring the
offerings made by fire to יהוה. He brings the fat with
the breast, to be waved as a wave offering before יהוה.

Lev
7:31  ‘And the priest shall burn the fat
on the altar, but the breast shall be Aharon’s and his sons.’ 
Lev
7:32  ‘And the right thigh you give to
the priest as a contribution from your peace offerings. 
Lev
7:33  ‘He among the sons of Aharon, who
brings the blood of the peace offering, and the fat, the right thigh is his for
a portion. 
Lev
7:34  ‘For the breast of the wave
offering and the thigh of the contribution I have taken from the children of
Yisra’ĕl, from their peace offerings, and I give them to Aharon the priest
and to his sons, as a law forever, from the children of Yisra’ĕl.’ ” 
Lev
7:35  This is the anointed portion for
Aharon and the anointed portion for his sons, from the offerings made by fire
to יהוה, on the day when Mosheh presented them to serve
as priests to יהוה, 
Lev
7:36  which יהוה
commanded to be given to them by the children of Yisra’ĕl, on the day that
He anointed them, a law forever throughout their generations. 
Lev
7:37  This is the Torah of the burnt
offering, of the grain offering, and of the sin offering, and of the guilt
offering, and of the ordinations, and of the peace offering, 
Lev
7:38  which יהוה
commanded Mosheh on Mount Sinai, on the day when He commanded the children of
Yisra’ĕl to bring their offerings to יהוה, in the
Wilderness of Sinai. 
Lev
8:1  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying,
Lev
8:2  “Take Aharon and his sons with him,
and the garments, and the anointing oil, and the bull of the sin offering, and
the two rams, and the basket of unleavened bread, 
Lev
8:3  and assemble all the congregation at
the door of the Tent of Meeting.” 
Lev
8:4  And Mosheh did as יהוה
commanded him, and the congregation was assembled at the door of the Tent of
Meeting. 
Lev
8:5  And Mosheh said to the congregation,
“This is the word יהוה commanded to be done.” 
Lev
8:6  So Mosheh brought Aharon and his
sons and washed them with water, 
Lev
8:7  and put the long shirt on him, and
girded him with the girdle, and dressed him in the robe, and put the shoulder
garment on him, and girded him with the embroidered band of the shoulder
garment, and with it tied the shoulder garment on him, 
Lev
8:8  and put the breastplate on him, and
put the Urim and the Tummim in the breastplate, 
Lev
8:9  and put the turban on his head. And
on the turban, on its front, he put the golden plate, the set-apart sign of
dedication, as יהוה had commanded Mosheh. 
Lev
8:10  And Mosheh took the anointing oil
and anointed the Dwelling Place and all that was in it, and set them apart. 
Lev
8:11  And he sprinkled some of it on the
altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all its utensils, and the basin
and its base, to set them apart. 
Lev
8:12  And he poured some of the anointing
oil on Aharon’s head and anointed him, to set him apart. 
Lev
8:13  And Mosheh brought the sons of
Aharon and put long shirts on them, and girded them with girdles, and put
turbans on them, as יהוה had commanded Mosheh. 
Lev
8:14  And he brought the bull for the sin
offering, and Aharon and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bull for
the sin offering, 
Lev
8:15  and it was slaughtered. And Mosheh
took the blood, and put some on the horns of the altar all around with his
finger, and cleansed the altar. And he poured the blood at the base of the
altar, and set it apart, to make atonement for it. 
Lev
8:16  And he took all the fat that was on
the entrails, and the appendage on the liver, and the two kidneys with their
fat, and Mosheh burned them on the altar. 
Lev
8:17  And the bull, and its skin, and its
flesh, and its dung, he burned with fire outside the camp, as יהוה
had commanded Mosheh. 
Lev
8:18  And he brought the ram of the burnt
offering, and Aharon and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram, 
Lev
8:19  and it was slaughtered. And Mosheh
sprinkled the blood on the altar all around, 
Lev
8:20  and he cut the ram into pieces. And
Mosheh burned the head, and the pieces, and the fat, 
Lev
8:21  and he washed the entrails and the
legs in water. And Mosheh burned the entire ram on the altar. It was a burnt
offering for a sweet fragrance, and an offering made by fire to יהוה,
as יהוה had commanded Mosheh. 
Lev
8:22  And he brought the second ram, the
ram of ordination, and Aharon and his sons laid their hands on the head of the
ram, 
Lev
8:23  and it was slaughtered. And Mosheh
took some of its blood and put it on the tip of Aharon’s right ear, and on the
thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot. 
Lev
8:24  And he brought near the sons of
Aharon, and Mosheh put some of the blood on the tips of their right ears, and
on the thumbs of their right hands, and on the big toes of their right feet.
And Mosheh sprinkled the blood on the altar all around, 
Lev
8:25  and took the fat and the fat tail,
and all the fat that was on the entrails, and the appendage on the liver, and
the two kidneys and their fat, and the right thigh, 
Lev
8:26  and from the basket of unleavened
bread that was before יהוה he took one unleavened cake,
and a cake of bread anointed with oil, and one thin cake, and put them on the
fat and on the right thigh, 
Lev
8:27  and placed all these in the hands
of Aharon and in the hands of his sons, and waved them as a wave offering
before יהוה. 
Lev
8:28  Mosheh then took them from their
hands and burned them on the altar, on the burnt offering. They were
ordinations for a sweet fragrance. It was an offering by fire to יהוה.

Lev
8:29  And Mosheh took the breast and
waved it, a wave offering before יהוה. It was Mosheh’s
portion of the ram of ordination, as יהוה had commanded
Mosheh. 
Lev
8:30  And Mosheh took some of the
anointing oil and some of the blood which was on the altar, and sprinkled it on
Aharon, on his garments, and on his sons, and on the garments of his sons with
him. And he set apart Aharon, his garments, and his sons, and the garments of
his sons with him. 
Lev
8:31  And Mosheh said to Aharon and his
sons, “Cook the flesh at the door of the Tent of Meeting, and eat it there with
the bread that is in the basket of the ordinations, as I have commanded,
saying, ‘Aharon and his sons are to eat it.’ 
Lev
8:32  “Then burn the rest of the flesh
and the bread with fire. 
Lev
8:33  “And do not go outside the door of
the Tent of Meeting for seven days, until the days of your ordination are
completed – for he fills your hands for seven days. 
Lev
8:34  “ יהוה has
commanded to do, as he has done this day, to make atonement for you. 
Lev
8:35  “And stay at the door of the Tent
of Meeting day and night for seven days. And you shall guard the duty of יהוה,
and not die, for so I have been commanded.” 
Lev
8:36  And Aharon and his sons did all the
words that יהוה had commanded by the hand of Mosheh. 
Lev
9:1  And on the eighth day it came to be
that Mosheh called Aharon and his sons and the elders of Yisra’ĕl. 
Lev
9:2  And he said to Aharon, “Take for
yourself a young bull as a sin offering and a ram as a burnt offering, a
perfect one, and bring them before יהוה. 
Lev
9:3  “And speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl,
saying, ‘Take a male goat as a sin offering, and a calf and a lamb, both a year
old, perfect ones, as a burnt offering, 
Lev
9:4  and a bull and a ram as peace
offerings, to slaughter before יהוה, and a grain offering
mixed with oil. For today יהוה shall appear to you.’ ” 
Lev
9:5  And they took what Mosheh commanded
before the Tent of Meeting, and all the congregation drew near and stood before
יהוה. 
Lev
9:6  And Mosheh said, “This is the word
which יהוה commanded you to do, so that the esteem of יהוה
appears to you.” 
Lev
9:7  And Mosheh said to Aharon, “Go to
the altar, and prepare your sin offering and your burnt offering, and make
atonement for yourself and for the people. And make the offering of the people,
and make atonement for them, as יהוה has commanded.” 
Lev
9:8  So Aharon came near to the altar and
slaughtered the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself. 
Lev
9:9  And the sons of Aharon brought the
blood to him, and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it on the horns of
the altar, and poured the blood at the base of the altar. 
Lev
9:10  And the fat, and the kidneys, and
the appendage on the liver of the sin offering he burned on the altar, as יהוה
had commanded Mosheh. 
Lev
9:11  And the flesh and the skin he
burned with fire outside the camp. 
Lev
9:12  And he slaughtered the burnt
offering, and the sons of Aharon presented to him the blood, which he sprinkled
on the altar all around. 
Lev
9:13  And they presented the burnt
offering to him, with its pieces and head, and he burned them on the altar. 
Lev
9:14  And he washed the entrails and the
legs, and burned them with the burnt offering on the altar. 
Lev
9:15  And he brought the people’s
offering, and took the goat, which was the sin offering for the people, and
slaughtered it and made it a sin offering, like the first one. 
Lev
9:16  And he brought the burnt offering
and made it, according to the right-ruling. 
Lev
9:17  He also brought the grain offering,
and filled his hand with it, and burned it on the altar, besides the burnt
offering of the morning. 
Lev
9:18  And he slaughtered the bull and the
ram as peace offerings, which were for the people. And Aharon’s sons presented
to him the blood, which he sprinkled on the altar all around, 
Lev
9:19  and the fat from the bull and the
ram, the fat tail, and the covering, and the kidneys, and the appendage on the
liver, 
Lev
9:20  and they placed the fat on the
breasts, and he burned the fat on the altar. 
Lev
9:21  But the breasts and the right thigh
Aharon waved as a wave offering before יהוה, as Mosheh
had commanded. 
Lev
9:22  Aharon then lifted up his hand
toward the people and blessed them, and came down from making the sin offering,
and the burnt offering, and the peace offerings. 
Lev
9:23  And Mosheh and Aharon went into the
Tent of Meeting, and came out and blessed the people. And the esteem of יהוה
appeared to all the people, 
Lev
9:24  and fire came out from before יהוה
and consumed the burnt offering and the fat on the altar. And all the people
saw and cried aloud and fell on their faces. 
Lev
10:1  And Naḏaḇ and Aḇihu,
the sons of Aharon, each took his fire holder and put fire in it, and put
incense on it, and brought strange fire before יהוה,
which He had not commanded them. 
Lev
10:2  And fire came out from יהוה
and consumed them, and they died before יהוה. 
Lev
10:3  Then Mosheh said to Aharon, “This
is what יהוה spoke, saying, ‘By those who come near Me
let Me be set-apart! And before all the people let Me be esteemed!’ ” And
Aharon was silent. 
Lev
10:4  And Mosheh called to Misha’ĕl
and to Eltsaphan, the sons of Uzzi’ĕl the uncle of Aharon, and said to
them, “Come near, take your brothers from before the set-apart place out of the
camp.” 
Lev
10:5  So they came near and took them by
their long shirts out of the camp, as Mosheh had said. 
Lev
10:6  And Mosheh said to Aharon, and to
El‛azar and to Ithamar, his sons, “Do not unbind your heads nor tear your
garments, lest you die, and wrath come upon all the people. But let your
brothers, all the house of Yisra’ĕl, bewail the burning which יהוה
has kindled. 
Lev
10:7  “And do not go out from the door of
the Tent of Meeting, lest you die, for the anointing oil of יהוה
is upon you.” And they did according to the word of Mosheh. 
Lev
10:8  And יהוה
spoke to Aharon, saying, 
Lev
10:9  “Do not drink wine or strong drink,
you, nor your sons with you, when you go into the Tent of Meeting, lest you die
– a law forever throughout your generations, 
Lev
10:10  so as to make a distinction
between the set-apart and the profane, and between the unclean and the clean, 
Lev
10:11  and to teach the children of Yisra’ĕl
all the laws which יהוה has spoken to them by the hand
of Mosheh.” 
Lev
10:12  And Mosheh spoke to Aharon, and to
El‛azar and Ithamar, his sons who were left, “Take the grain offering
that is left over from the offerings made by fire to יהוה,
and eat it without leaven beside the altar, for it is most set-apart. 
Lev
10:13  “And you shall eat it in a
set-apart place, because it is yours by law and your sons’ by law, of the
offerings made by fire to יהוה, for so I have been
commanded. 
Lev
10:14  “And the breast of the wave
offering and the thigh of the contribution you eat in a clean place, you, and your
sons, and your daughters with you. For they are yours by law and your sons’ by
law, which are given from the slaughterings of peace offerings of the children
of Yisra’ĕl. 
Lev
10:15  “The thigh of the contribution and
the breast of the wave offering they bring with the offerings of fat made by
fire, to bring as a wave offering before יהוה. And it
shall be yours and your sons’ with you, by a law forever, as יהוה
has commanded.” 
Lev
10:16  And Mosheh diligently looked for
the goat of the sin offering and saw it was burned up. And he was wroth with El‛azar
and Ithamar, the sons of Aharon who were left, saying, 
Lev
10:17  “Why have you not eaten the sin
offering in a set-apart place, since it is most set-apart, and Elohim has given
it to you to bear the crookedness of the congregation, to make atonement for
them before יהוה ? 
Lev
10:18  “See, its blood was not brought
inside the set-apart place. You should have eaten it without fail in a set-apart
place, as I have commanded.” 
Lev
10:19  And Aharon said to Mosheh, “See,
today they have brought their sin offering and their burnt offering before יהוה,
and matters like these have come to
me! If I had eaten the sin offering today, would it have been right in the eyes
of יהוה ?” 
Lev
10:20  And when Mosheh heard that, it was
good in his eyes. 
Lev
11:1  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh and to Aharon, saying to them, 
Lev
11:2  “Speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl,
saying, ‘These are the living creatures which you do eat among all the beasts
that are on the earth: 
Lev
11:3  ‘Whatever has a split hoof
completely divided, chewing the cud, among the beasts, that you do eat. 
Lev
11:4  ‘Only, these you do not eat among
those that chew the cud or those that have a split hoof: the camel, because it
chews the cud but does not have a split hoof, it is unclean to you; 
Lev
11:5  and the rabbit, because it chews
the cud but does not have a split hoof, it is unclean to you; 
Lev
11:6  and the hare, because it chews the
cud but does not have a split hoof, it is unclean to you; 
Lev
11:7  and the pig, though it has a split
hoof, completely divided, yet does not chew the cud, it is unclean to you. 
Lev
11:8  ‘Their flesh you do not eat, and
their carcasses you do not touch. They are unclean to you. 
Lev
11:9  ‘These you do eat of all that are
in the waters: any one that has fins and scales in the waters, in the seas or
in the rivers, that you do eat. 
Lev
11:10  ‘But all that have not fins and
scales in the seas and in the rivers, all that move in the waters or any living
creature which is in the waters, they are an abomination to you. 
Lev
11:11  ‘They are an abomination to you –
of their flesh you do not eat, and their carcasses you abominate. 
Lev
11:12  ‘All that have not fins or scales
in the waters is an abomination to you. 
Lev
11:13  ‘And these you do abominate among
the birds, they are not eaten, they are an abomination: the eagle, and the
vulture, and the black vulture, 
Lev
11:14  and the hawk, and the falcon after
its kind, 
Lev
11:15  every raven after its kind, 
Lev
11:16  and the ostrich, and the
nighthawk, and the seagull, and the hawk after its kind, 
Lev
11:17  and the little owl, and the fisher
owl, and the great owl, 
Lev
11:18  and the white owl, and the pelican,
and the carrion vulture, 
Lev
11:19  and the stork, the heron after its
kind, and the hoopoe, and the bat. 
Lev
11:20  ‘All flying insects that creep on
all fours is an abomination to you. 
Lev
11:21  ‘Only, these you do eat of every
flying insect that creeps on all fours: those which have jointed legs above
their feet with which to leap on the earth. 
Lev
11:22  ‘These of them you do eat: the
locust after its kind, and the destroying locust after its kind, and the
cricket after its kind, and the grasshopper after its kind. 
Lev
11:23  ‘But all other flying insects
which have four feet is an abomination to you. 
Lev
11:24  ‘And by these you are made
unclean, anyone touching the carcass of any of them is unclean until evening, 
Lev
11:25  and anyone picking up part of the
carcass of any of them has to wash his garments, and shall be unclean until
evening. 
Lev
11:26  ‘Every beast that has a split hoof
not completely divided, or does not chew the cud, is unclean to you. Anyone who
touches their carcass is unclean. 
Lev
11:27  ‘And whatever goes on its paws,
among all the creatures that go on all fours, those are unclean to you. Anyone
who touches their carcass is unclean until evening, 
Lev
11:28  and he who picks up their carcass
has to wash his garments, and shall be unclean until evening. They are unclean
to you. 
Lev
11:29  ‘And these are unclean to you
among the creeping creatures that creep on the earth: the mole, and the mouse,
and the tortoise after its kind, 
Lev
11:30  and the gecko, and the land
crocodile, and the sand reptile, and the sand lizard, and the chameleon. 
Lev
11:31  ‘These are unclean to you among
all that creep. Anyone who touches them when they are dead becomes unclean
until evening. 
Lev
11:32  ‘And whatever any of them in its
dead state falls upon, becomes unclean, whether it is any wooden object or
garment or skin or sack, any object in which work is done, it is put in water.
And it shall be unclean until evening, then it shall be clean. 
Lev
11:33  ‘Any earthen vessel into which any
of them falls, whatever is in it becomes unclean, and you break it. 
Lev
11:34  ‘Any of the food which might be
eaten, on which water comes, becomes unclean, and any drink which might be
drunk from it becomes unclean. 
Lev
11:35  ‘And on whatever any of their carcass falls becomes
unclean – an oven or cooking range – it is broken down. They are unclean, and
are unclean to you. 
Lev
11:36  ‘But a fountain or a well, a
collection of water, is clean, but whatever touches their carcass is unclean. 
Lev
11:37  ‘And when any of their carcass falls on any planting seed which is to be
sown, it is clean. 
Lev
11:38  ‘But when any water is put on the
seed and any part of any such carcass falls on it, it is unclean to you. 
Lev
11:39  ‘And when any of the beasts which
are yours for food dies, he who touches its carcass becomes unclean until
evening. 
Lev
11:40  ‘And he who eats of its carcass
has to wash his garments, and shall be unclean until evening. And he who picks
up its carcass has to wash his garments, and shall be unclean until evening. 
Lev
11:41  ‘And every creeping creature that
creeps on the earth is an abomination, it is not eaten. 
Lev
11:42  ‘Whatever crawls on its stomach,
and whatever goes on all fours, and whatever has many feet among all creeping
creatures that creep on the earth, these you do not eat, for they are an
abomination. 
Lev
11:43  ‘Do not make yourselves abominable
with any creeping creature that creeps, and do not make yourselves unclean with
them, lest you be defiled by them. 
Lev
11:44  ‘For I am יהוה
your Elohim, and you shall set yourselves apart. And you shall be set-apart,
for I am set-apart. And do not defile yourselves with any creeping creature
that creeps on the earth. 
Lev
11:45  ‘For I am יהוה
who is bringing you up out of the land of Mitsrayim, to be your Elohim. And you
shall be set-apart, for I am set-apart. 
Lev
11:46  ‘This is the Torah of the beasts
and the birds and every living creature that moves in the waters, and of every
creature that creeps on the earth, 
Lev
11:47  to make a distinction between the
unclean and the clean, and between the living creature that is eaten and the
living creature that is not eaten.’ ” 
Lev
12:1  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying,
Lev
12:2  “Speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl,
saying, ‘When a woman has conceived, and has given birth to a male child, then
she shall be unclean seven days, as in the days of her monthly separation she
is unclean. 
Lev
12:3  ‘And on the eighth day the flesh of
his foreskin is circumcised. 
Lev
12:4  ‘And she remains in the blood of
her cleansing thirty-three days. She does not touch whatever is set-apart, and
she does not come into the set-apart place until the days of her cleansing are
completed. 
Lev
12:5  ‘But if she gives birth to a female
child, then she shall be unclean for two weeks, as in her monthly separation,
and she remains in the blood of her cleansing for sixty-six days. 
Lev
12:6  ‘And when the days of her cleansing
are completed, for a son or for a daughter, she brings to the priest a lamb a
year old, as a burnt offering, and a young pigeon or a turtledove as a sin
offering, to the door of the Tent of Meeting. 
Lev
12:7  ‘And he shall bring it before יהוה,
and make atonement for her, and she shall be cleansed from the flow of her
blood. This is the Torah for her who has given birth to a male or a female. 
Lev
12:8  ‘And if she is not able to bring a
lamb, then she shall bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons, one as a burnt
offering and the other as a sin offering. And the priest shall make atonement
for her, and she shall be clean.’ ” 
Lev
13:1  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh and to Aharon, saying, 
Lev
13:2  “When a man has on the skin of his body
a swelling, a scab, or a bright spot, and it shall become on the skin of his
body like a leprous infection, then he shall be brought to Aharon the priest or
to one of his sons the priests. 
Lev
13:3  “And the priest shall look at the
infection on the skin of the body. And if the hair on the infection has turned
white, and the infection appears to be deeper than the skin of his body, it is
a leprous infection. And the priest shall look at him, and pronounce him
unclean. 
Lev
13:4  “But if the bright spot is white on
the skin of his body, and does not appear to be deeper than the skin, and its
hair has not turned white, then the priest shall shut up the infected one seven
days. 
Lev
13:5  “And the priest shall look at him
on the seventh day and see, if the infection appears to be as it was, and the
infection has not spread on the skin, then the priest shall shut him up another
seven days. 
Lev
13:6  “And the priest shall look at him
again on the seventh day and see, if the infection has darkened, and the infection
has not spread on the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean. It is a
scab, and he shall wash his garments and be clean. 
Lev
13:7  “But if the scab spreads further
over the skin, after he has been seen by the priest for his cleansing, he shall
be seen by the priest again. 
Lev
13:8  “And the priest shall look and see,
if the scab has spread on the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him
unclean, it is leprosy. 
Lev
13:9  “When the infection of leprosy is
on a man, then he shall be brought to the priest. 
Lev
13:10  “And the priest shall look and
see, if the swelling on the skin is white, and it has turned the hair white,
and there is a spot of raw flesh in the swelling, 
Lev
13:11  it is an old leprosy on the skin
of his body, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean. He does not shut him
up, for he is unclean. 
Lev
13:12  “And if leprosy breaks out all
over the skin, and the leprosy shall cover all the skin of the infected one,
from his head to his foot, wherever the priest looks, 
Lev
13:13  then the priest shall look and
see, if the leprosy has covered all his body, he shall pronounce the infected
one clean. It has all turned white, he is clean. 
Lev
13:14  “But the day raw flesh appears on
him, he is unclean. 
Lev
13:15  “And the priest shall look at the
raw flesh and pronounce him to be unclean – the raw flesh is unclean, it is
leprosy. 
Lev
13:16  “Or when the raw flesh changes and
turns white again, he shall come to the priest. 
Lev
13:17  “And the priest shall look at him
and see, if the infection has turned white, then the priest shall pronounce the
infected one clean, he is clean. 
Lev
13:18  “And when the body has a boil in
the skin, and it is healed, 
Lev
13:19  and in the place of the boil there
comes a white swelling or a bright spot, reddish-white, then it shall be seen
by the priest. 
Lev
13:20  “And the priest shall look and
see, if it appears deeper than the skin, and its hair has turned white, the
priest shall pronounce him unclean, it is a leprous infection which has broken
out of the boil. 
Lev
13:21  “But if the priest looks at it and
sees no white hairs in it, and it is not deeper than the skin, but has faded,
then the priest shall shut him up seven days; 
Lev
13:22  and if it has spread further over
the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean, it is a leprous
infection. 
Lev
13:23  “But if the bright spot stays in
its place, it has not spread, it is the scar of the boil, and the priest shall
pronounce him clean. 
Lev
13:24  “Or when the body receives a burn
on its skin by fire, and the raw flesh of the burn shall become a bright spot,
reddish-white or white, 
Lev
13:25  then the priest shall look at it
and see, if the hair of the bright spot has turned white, and it appears deeper
than the skin, it is leprosy broken out in the burn. And the priest shall
pronounce him unclean, it is a leprous infection. 
Lev
13:26  “But if the priest looks at it and
sees there are no white hairs in the bright spot, and it is not deeper than the
skin, but has faded, then the priest shall shut him up seven days. 
Lev
13:27  “And the priest shall look at him
on the seventh day. If it spreads further over the skin, then the priest shall
pronounce him unclean, it is a leprous infection. 
Lev
13:28  “But if the bright spot stays in
its place, and has not spread on the skin, but has faded, it is a swelling from
the burn. And the priest shall pronounce him clean, for it is the scar from the
burn. 
Lev
13:29  “And when a man, or a woman, has
an infection on the head or in the beard, 
Lev
13:30  then the priest shall look at the
infection and see, if it appears deeper than the skin, and there is thin yellow
hair in it, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean, it is an eruption, a
leprosy of the head or beard. 
Lev
13:31  “But when the priest looks at the
infection of the eruption and sees that it does not appear deeper than the
skin, and there is no black hair in it, then the priest shall shut up the one with the infection of the
eruption seven days. 
Lev
13:32  “And on the seventh day the priest
shall look at the infection and see, if the eruption has not spread, and there
is no yellow hair in it, and the eruption does not appear deeper than the skin,

Lev
13:33  then he shall shave himself, but
the eruption he does not shave. And the priest shall shut up the one with the eruption another seven
days. 
Lev
13:34  “And on the seventh day the priest
shall look at the eruption and see, if the eruption has not spread over the
skin, and does not appear deeper than the skin, then the priest shall pronounce
him clean. And he shall wash his garments, and he shall be clean. 
Lev
13:35  “But if the eruption spreads
further over the skin after his cleansing, 
Lev
13:36  then the priest shall look at him
and see, if the eruption has spread over the skin, the priest need not seek for
yellow hair, he is unclean. 
Lev
13:37  “But if the eruption appears to
have stayed, and there is black hair grown up in it, the eruption has healed.
He is clean, and the priest shall pronounce him clean. 
Lev
13:38  “And when a man or a woman has
bright spots on the skin of the body, white bright spots, 
Lev
13:39  then the priest shall look and
see, if the bright spots on the skin of the body are dull white, it is a white
spot that grows on the skin, he is clean. 
Lev
13:40  “And when a man loses the hair of
his head, he is bald, he is clean. 
Lev
13:41  “And if the hair has fallen from
his forehead, he is bald on the forehead, he is clean. 
Lev
13:42  “And when there is on the bald
head or bald forehead a reddish-white infection, it is leprosy breaking out on
his bald head or his bald forehead. 
Lev
13:43  “And the priest shall look at it
and see, if the swelling of the infection is reddish-white on his bald head or
on his bald forehead, as the appearance of leprosy on the skin of the body, 
Lev
13:44  he is a leprous man, he is
unclean. The priest shall pronounce him unclean, without fail, his infection is
on his head. 
Lev
13:45  “As for the leper who has the
infection, his garments are torn, and his head is uncovered, and he has to
cover his upper lip and cry, ‘Unclean! Unclean!’ 
Lev
13:46  “He is unclean – all the days he
has the infection he is unclean. He is unclean, and he dwells alone, his
dwelling place is outside the camp. 
Lev
13:47  “And when a garment has an infection
of leprosy in it, in a woollen garment or in a linen garment, 
Lev
13:48  or in the warp or in the weft of
linen or wool, or in leather or in any leather-work, 
Lev
13:49  and the infection shall be
greenish or reddish in the garment or in the leather, or in the warp or in the
weft, or in any leather object, it is an infection of leprosy and shall be
shown to the priest. 
Lev
13:50  “And the priest shall look at the
infection and shut up the infected one seven days. 
Lev
13:51  “And he shall look at the
infection on the seventh day. And when the infection has spread in the garment,
or in the warp or in the weft, or in the leather or any leather-work, the
infection is an active leprosy, it is unclean. 
Lev
13:52  “And he shall burn that garment,
or the warp or the weft, in wool or in linen, or any leather object in which
the infection is, for it is an active leprosy. It is burned with fire. 
Lev
13:53  “But if the priest looks and sees
that the infection has not spread in the garment, or in the warp or in the
weft, or in any leather object, 
Lev
13:54  then the priest shall give
command, and they shall wash that in which the infection is. And he shall shut
it up another seven days. 
Lev
13:55  “And the priest shall look at the
infection after it has been washed and see, if the infection has not changed
its appearance, though the infection has not spread, it is unclean, and burn it
in the fire – it is eaten away, in its inside or outside. 
Lev
13:56  “And if the priest shall look and
see that the infection has faded after washing it, then he shall tear it out of
the garment, or out of the warp, or out of the weft, or out of the leather. 
Lev
13:57  “And if it is still seen in the
garment, or in the warp or in the weft, or in any leather object, it is a spreading
infection. Burn it with fire, that in which the infection is. 
Lev
13:58  “And if you wash the garment, or
the warp or the weft, or any leather object, if the infection has disappeared
from it, then it shall be washed a second time, and shall be clean. 
Lev
13:59  “This is the Torah of the
infection of leprosy in a garment of wool or linen, or in the warp or in the
weft, or in any leather object, to pronounce it clean or to pronounce it
unclean.” 
Lev
14:1  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying, 
Lev
14:2  “This shall be the Torah of the
leper for the day of his cleansing: He shall be brought to the priest,
Lev
14:3  and the priest shall go out of the
camp, and the priest shall look and see, if the leprosy is healed in the leper,

Lev
14:4  then the priest shall command, and
he shall take for him who is to be cleansed two live and clean birds, and cedar
wood, and scarlet, and hyssop. 
Lev
14:5  “And the priest shall command, and
he shall kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water. 
Lev
14:6  “Let him take the live bird and the
cedar wood and the scarlet and the hyssop, and dip them and the live bird in
the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water. 
Lev
14:7  “And he shall sprinkle it seven
times on him who is to be cleansed from the leprosy, and shall pronounce him
clean, and shall let the live bird loose in the open field. 
Lev
14:8  “And he who is to be cleansed shall
wash his garments, and shall shave off all his hair and wash himself in water,
and shall be clean. Then after that he comes into the camp, but shall stay
outside his tent seven days. 
Lev
14:9  “And on the seventh day it shall be
that he shaves all the hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even
all his hair he shaves off. And he shall wash his garments and wash his body in
water, and shall be clean. 
Lev
14:10  “And on the eighth day he takes
two male lambs, perfect ones, and one ewe lamb a year old, a perfect one, and
three-tenths of an ĕphah of fine
flour mixed with oil as a grain offering, and one log of oil. 
Lev
14:11  “And the priest who is cleansing
shall present the man who is to be cleansed, with these offerings, before יהוה, at the door of the
Tent of Meeting. 
Lev
14:12  “And the priest shall take one
male lamb and bring it as a guilt offering, and the log of oil, and wave them
as a wave offering before יהוה. 
Lev
14:13  “And he shall slaughter the lamb
in the place where he slaughters the sin offering and the burnt offering, in a
set-apart place. For the guilt offering, like the sin offering, belongs to the
priest. It is most set-apart. 
Lev
14:14  “And the priest shall take some of
the blood of the guilt offering, and the priest shall put it on the tip of the
right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and
on the big toe of his right foot. 
Lev
14:15  “And the priest shall take some of
the log of oil, and pour it into the palm of his own left hand. 
Lev
14:16  “And the priest shall dip his
right finger in the oil that is in his left hand, and shall sprinkle some of
the oil with his finger seven times before יהוה. 
Lev
14:17  “And of the rest of the oil in his
hand, the priest puts some on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be
cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right
foot, on the blood of the guilt offering. 
Lev
14:18  “And the rest of the oil that is
in the priest’s hand he puts on the head of him who is to be cleansed. And the
priest shall make atonement for him before יהוה. 
Lev
14:19  “And the priest shall make the sin
offering, and make atonement for him who is to be cleansed from his
uncleanness. Then afterwards he slaughters the burnt offering. 
Lev
14:20  “And the priest shall offer the
burnt offering and the grain offering on the altar. And the priest shall make
atonement for him, and he shall be clean. 
Lev
14:21  “But if he is poor and is unable
to afford it, then he shall take one male lamb as a guilt offering to be waved,
to make atonement for him, and one-tenth of
an ĕphah of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering, and a log
of oil, 
Lev
14:22  and two turtledoves or two young
pigeons, such as he is able to afford, and one shall be a sin offering and the
other a burnt offering. 
Lev
14:23  “And he shall bring them to the priest
on the eighth day for his cleansing, to the door of the Tent of Meeting, before
יהוה. 
Lev
14:24  “And the priest shall take the
lamb of the guilt offering and the log of oil, and the priest shall wave them
as a wave offering before יהוה. 
Lev
14:25  “And he shall slaughter the lamb
of the guilt offering, and the priest shall take some of the blood of the guilt
offering and put it on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed,

Lev
14:26  “Then the priest pours some of the
oil into the palm of his own left hand.

atonement for him before יהוה. 
Lev
14:30  “And he shall prepare one of the
turtledoves or young pigeons, such as he is able to afford, 
Lev
14:31  that which he is able to afford,
the one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering, with the grain
offering. And the priest shall make atonement for him who is to be cleansed
before יהוה. 
Lev
14:32  “This is the Torah for one who had
an infection of leprosy, who is unable to afford for his cleansing.” 
Lev
14:33  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh and to Aharon, saying, 
Lev
14:34  “When you come into the land of
Kena‛an, which I am giving you as a possession, and I put a plague of
leprosy in a house in the land of your possession, 
Lev
14:35  then shall the one who owns the
house come and inform the priest, saying, ‘It seems to me that there is some
plague in the house.’ 
Lev
14:36  “And the priest shall command, and
they shall empty the house, before the priest goes in to look at the plague, so
that all that is in the house is not made unclean. And after that the priest
goes in to look at the house. 
Lev
14:37  “And he shall look at the plague
and see, if the plague is on the walls of the house with sunken places,
greenish or reddish, which appear to be deep in the wall, 
Lev
14:38  then the priest shall go out of
the house, to the door of the house, and shut up the house seven days. 
Lev
14:39  “And the priest shall come again
on the seventh day and look and see, if the plague has spread on the walls of
the house, 
Lev
14:40  then the priest shall command, and
they shall remove the stones with the plague in them, and they shall throw them
outside the city, into an unclean place, 
Lev
14:41  while he lets the house be scraped
inside, all around, and the dust that they scrape off they shall pour out in an
unclean place outside the city. 
Lev
14:42  “And they shall take other stones
and put them in the place of those stones, and take other mortar and plaster the
house. 
Lev
14:43  “And if the plague comes back and
breaks out in the house, after he has removed the stones, after he has scraped
the house, and after it is plastered, 
Lev
14:44  then the priest shall come and
look and see, if the plague has spread in the house, it is an active leprosy in
the house, it is unclean. 
Lev
14:45  “And he shall break down the
house, its stones, and its timber, and all the plaster of the house, and he
shall bring them outside the city to an unclean place. 
Lev
14:46  “And he who goes into the house,
all the days while it is shut up, becomes unclean until evening. 
Lev
14:47  “And he who lies down in the house
has to wash his garments, and he who eats in the house has to wash his
garments. 
Lev
14:48  “However, if the priest indeed
comes in and looks at it and sees that the plague has not spread in the house
after the house was plastered, then the priest shall pronounce the house clean,
because the plague is healed. 
Lev
14:49  “And to cleanse the house, he
shall take two birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop. 
Lev
14:50  “And he shall kill one of the
birds in an earthen vessel over running water, 
Lev
14:51  and he shall take the cedar wood,
and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the live bird, and dip them in the blood
of the slain bird and in the running water, and shall sprinkle the house seven
times. 
Lev
14:52  “He shall thus cleanse the house
with the blood of the bird and the running water and the live bird, and with
the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet, 
Lev
14:53  and he shall let the live bird
loose outside the city in the open field, and shall make atonement for the
house, and it shall be clean. 
Lev
14:54  “This is the Torah for any
infection of leprosy, and eruption, 
Lev
14:55  and for leprosy of a garment, and
of a house, 
Lev
14:56  and for a swelling, and for a
scab, and for a bright spot, 
Lev
14:57  to teach when it is unclean and
when it is clean. This is the Torah of leprosy.” 
Lev
15:1  And יהוה spoke
to Mosheh and to Aharon, saying, 
Lev
15:2  “Speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl,
and say to them, ‘When any man has a discharge from his flesh, his discharge is
unclean. 
Lev
15:3  ‘And this is his uncleanness in
regard to his discharge; whether his flesh runs with his discharge, or his
flesh is stopped up by his discharge, it is his uncleanness. 
Lev
15:4  ‘Any bed becomes unclean on which
he who has the discharge lies, and any object on which he sits becomes unclean.

Lev
15:5  ‘And anyone who touches his bed has
to wash his garments, and shall bathe in water, and be unclean until evening. 
Lev
15:6  ‘And he who sits on any object on
which he who has the discharge sat, has to wash his garments, and shall bathe
in water, and be unclean until evening. 
Lev
15:7  ‘And he who touches the flesh of
him who has the discharge has to wash his garments, and shall bathe in water,
and shall be unclean until evening. 
Lev
15:8  ‘And when he who has the discharge
spits on him who is clean, then he shall wash his garments, and shall bathe in
water, and be unclean until evening. 
Lev
15:9  ‘Any saddle on which he who has the
discharge rides becomes unclean. 
Lev
15:10  ‘And whoever touches any of that
which was under him is unclean until evening. And he who is carrying them up
has to wash his garments, and shall bathe in water, and be unclean until
evening. 
Lev
15:11  ‘And anyone whom he who has the
discharge touches without rinsing his hands in water, shall wash his garments
and bathe in water, and be unclean until evening. 
Lev
15:12  ‘And the earthen vessel which he
who has the discharge touches has to be broken, and every wooden vessel has to
be rinsed in water. 
Lev
15:13  ‘And when he who has a discharge
is cleansed of his discharge, then he shall count for himself seven days for
his cleansing, and shall wash his garments, and shall bathe his flesh in
running water, and be clean. 
Lev
15:14  ‘And on the eighth day he takes
for himself two turtledoves or two young pigeons, and shall come before יהוה,
to the door of the Tent of Meeting, and shall give them to the priest. 
Lev
15:15  ‘And the priest shall prepare
them, the one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering. And the
priest shall make atonement for him before יהוה because
of his discharge. 
Lev
15:16  ‘And when a man has an emission of
semen, then he shall wash all his flesh in water, and be unclean until evening.

Lev
15:17  ‘And any garment and any leather
on which there is semen, shall also be washed with water, and be unclean until
evening. 
Lev
15:18  ‘And when a woman lies with a man,
and there is an emission of semen, they both shall bathe in water, and be
unclean until evening. 
Lev
15:19  ‘And when a woman has a discharge,
and the discharge from her flesh is blood, she has to be in her separation for
seven days. And whoever touches her is unclean until evening. 
Lev
15:20  ‘And whatever she lies on during
her separation is unclean. And whatever she sits on is unclean. 
Lev
15:21  ‘And anyone who touches her bed
has to wash his garments, and shall bathe in water, and be unclean until
evening. 
Lev
15:22  ‘And whoever touches any object
that she sat on has to wash his garments, and shall bathe in water, and be
unclean until evening. 
Lev
15:23  ‘And if it is on the bed or on any
object on which she sits, when he touches it, he is unclean until evening. 
Lev
15:24  ‘And if any man lies with her at
all, and her monthly flow is on him, he shall be unclean seven days. And any
bed he lies on is unclean. 
Lev
15:25  ‘And when a woman has a discharge
of blood for many days, other than at the time of her monthly separation, or
when she discharges beyond her usual time of monthly separation, all the days
of her unclean discharge shall be as the days of her monthly separation. She is
unclean. 
Lev
15:26  ‘Any bed on which she lies all the
days of her discharge is to her as the bed of her monthly separation. And
whatever she sits on is unclean, as the uncleanness of her monthly separation.

15:27  ‘And anyone who touches them is
unclean, and shall wash his garments, and shall bathe in water, and be unclean
until evening. 
Lev
15:28  ‘But if she is cleansed of her
discharge, then she shall count for herself seven days, and after that she is
clean. 
Lev
15:29  ‘And on the eighth day she takes
for herself two turtledoves or two young pigeons, and shall bring them to the
priest, to the door of the Tent of Meeting. 
Lev
15:30  ‘And the priest shall prepare the
one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering, and the priest shall
make atonement for her before יהוה for the discharge of
her uncleanness. 
Lev
15:31  ‘Thus you shall separate the
children of Yisra’ĕl from their uncleanness, lest they die in their
uncleanness when they defile My Dwelling Place which is in their midst. 
Lev
15:32  ‘This is the Torah for one who has
a discharge, and for him who emits semen and is unclean thereby, 
Lev
15:33  and for her who is sick in her
monthly separation, and for one who has a discharge, either man or woman, and
for him who lies with an unclean woman.’ ” 
Lev
16:1  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh after the death of the two sons of Aharon, as they drew near
before יהוה, and died. 
Lev
16:2  And יהוה
said to Mosheh, “Speak to Aharon your brother not to come in at all times to
the Set-apart Place inside the veil, before the lid of atonement which is on
the ark, lest he die, because I appear in the cloud above the lid of atonement.

Lev
16:3  “With this Aharon should come into
the Set-apart Place: with the blood of a young bull as a sin offering, and of a
ram as a burnt offering. 
Lev
16:4  “He should put on the set-apart
linen long shirt, with linen trousers on his flesh, and gird himself with a
linen girdle, and be dressed with the linen turban – they are set-apart
garments. And he shall bathe his body in water, and shall put them on. 
Lev
16:5  “And from the congregation of the
children of Yisra’ĕl he takes two male goats as a sin offering, and one
ram as a burnt offering. 
Lev
16:6  “And Aharon shall bring the bull as
a sin offering, which is for himself, and make atonement for himself and for
his house. 
Lev
16:7  “And he shall take the two goats
and let them stand before יהוה at the door of the Tent
of Meeting. 
Lev
16:8  “And Aharon shall cast lots for the
two goats, one lot for יהוה and the other lot for
Azazel. 
Lev
16:9  “And Aharon shall bring the goat on
which the lot for יהוה fell, and shall prepare it as a
sin offering. 
Lev
16:10  “But the goat on which the lot for
Azazel fell is caused to stand alive before יהוה, to make
atonement upon it, to send it into the wilderness to Azazel.
Lev
16:11  “And Aharon shall bring the bull
of the sin offering, which is for himself, and make atonement for himself and
for his house, and shall slaughter the bull as the sin offering which is for
himself, 
Lev
16:12  and shall take a fire holder
filled with burning coals of fire from the altar before יהוה,
with his hands filled with sweet incense beaten fine, and shall bring it inside
the veil. 
Lev
16:13  “And he shall put the incense on the
fire before יהוה, and the cloud of incense shall cover
the lid of atonement which is on the Witness, lest he die. 
Lev
16:14  “And he shall take some of the
blood of the bull and sprinkle it with his finger on the lid of atonement on
the east side, also in front of the lid of atonement he sprinkles some of the
blood with his finger seven times. 
Lev
16:15  “And he shall slaughter the goat
of the sin offering, which is for the people, and shall bring its blood inside
the veil, and shall do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bull,
and sprinkle it on the lid of atonement and in front of the lid of atonement. 
Lev
16:16  “And he shall make atonement for
the Set-apart Place, because of the uncleanness of the children of Yisra’ĕl,
and because of their transgressions in all their sins. And so he does for the
Tent of Meeting which is dwelling with them in the midst of their uncleanness. 
Lev
16:17  “And no man should be in the Tent
of Meeting when he goes in to make atonement in the Set-apart Place, until he
comes out. And he shall make atonement for himself, and for his household, and
for all the assembly of Yisra’ĕl. 
Lev
16:18  “And he shall go out to the altar
that is before יהוה, and make atonement for it. And he
shall take some of the blood of the bull and some of the blood of the goat, and
put it on the horns of the altar all around. 
Lev
16:19  “And he shall sprinkle some of the
blood on it with his finger seven times, and cleanse it, and set it apart from
the uncleanness of the children of Yisra’ĕl. 
Lev
16:20  “And when he has finished atoning
for the Set-apart Place, and the Tent of Meeting, and the altar, he shall bring
the live goat. 
Lev
16:21  “Then Aharon shall lay both his
hands on the head of the live goat, and shall confess over it all the
crookednesses of the children of Yisra’ĕl, and all their transgressions in
all their sins, and shall put them on the head of the goat, and shall send it
away into the wilderness by the hand of a fit man. 
Lev
16:22  “And the goat shall bear on itself
all their crookednesses, to a land cut off. Thus he shall send the goat away
into the wilderness. 
Lev
16:23  “Aharon shall then come into the
Tent of Meeting, and shall take off the linen garments which he put on when he
went into the Set-apart Place, and shall leave them there. 
Lev
16:24  “And he shall bathe his body in
water in the set-apart place, and shall put on his garments, and shall come out
and prepare his burnt offering and the burnt offering of the people, and make
atonement for himself and for the people, 
Lev
16:25  and burn the fat of the sin
offering on the altar. 
Lev
16:26  “And he who sent away the goat to
Azazel washes his garments, and shall bathe his body in water, and afterward he
comes into the camp. 
Lev
16:27  “And the bull for the sin offering
and the goat for the sin offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement
in the Set-apart Place, is brought outside the camp. And they shall burn their
skins, and their flesh, and their dung with fire. 
Lev
16:28  “And he who burns them washes his
garments, and shall bathe his body in water, and afterward he comes into the
camp. 
Lev
16:29  “And this shall be for you a law
forever: In the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, you afflict your
beings, and do no work, the native or the stranger who sojourns among you. 
Lev
16:30  “For on that day he makes
atonement for you, to cleanse you, to be clean from all your sins before יהוה.

Lev
16:31  “It is a Sabbath of rest for you,
and you shall afflict your beings – a law forever. 
Lev
16:32  “And the priest, who is anointed
and ordained to serve as priest in his father’s place, shall make atonement,
and shall put on the linen garments, the set-apart garments, 
Lev
16:33  and he shall make atonement for
the Most Set-apart Place, and make atonement for the Tent of Meeting and for
the altar, and make atonement for the priests and for all the people of the
assembly. 
Lev
16:34  “And this shall be for you a law
forever, to make atonement for the children of Yisra’ĕl, for all their
sins, once a year.” And he did as יהוה commanded
Mosheh. 
Lev
17:1  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying,
Lev
17:2  “Speak to Aharon, to his sons, and
to all the children of Yisra’ĕl, and say to them, ‘This is the word which יהוה
has commanded, saying, 
Lev
17:3  “Any man from the house of Yisra’ĕl
who slaughters a bull or a lamb or a goat in the camp, or who slaughters it
outside the camp, 
Lev
17:4  and does not bring it to the door
of the Tent of Meeting, to bring an offering to יהוה
before the Dwelling Place of יהוה, blood-guilt is
reckoned to that man. He has shed blood, and that man shall be cut off from
among his people, 
Lev
17:5  in order that the children of Yisra’ĕl
bring their slaughterings which they slaughter in the open field. And they shall
bring them to יהוה at the door of the Tent of meeting,
to the priest, and slaughter them as peace offerings to יהוה.

Lev
17:6  “And the priest shall sprinkle the
blood on the altar of יהוה at the door of the Tent of
Meeting, and shall burn the fat for a sweet fragrance to יהוה.

Lev
17:7  “And let them no longer slaughter
their slaughterings to demons, after whom they whored. This is a law forever
for them throughout their generations.” ’ 
Lev
17:8  “And say to them, ‘Any man of the
house of Yisra’ĕl, or of the strangers who sojourn among you, who offers a
burnt offering or slaughtering, 
Lev
17:9  and does not bring it to the door
of the Tent of Meeting, to do it to יהוה, that man
shall be cut off from among his people. 
Lev
17:10  ‘And any man of the house of Yisra’ĕl,
or of the strangers who sojourn among you, who eats any blood, I shall set My
face against that being who eats blood, and shall cut him off from among his
people. 
Lev
17:11  ‘For the life of the flesh is in
the blood, and I have given it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your
lives, for it is the blood that makes atonement for the life.’ 
Lev
17:12  “Therefore I said to the children
of Yisra’ĕl, ‘No being among you eats blood, nor does any stranger who
sojourns among you eat blood.’ 
Lev
17:13  “And any man from the children of
Yisra’ĕl, or from the strangers who sojourn among you, who hunts and
catches any beast or bird, which is eaten, shall pour out its blood and cover
it with dust, 
Lev
17:14  for it is the life of all flesh.
Its blood is for its life. And I said to the children of Yisra’ĕl, ‘Do not
eat the blood of any flesh, for the life of all flesh is its blood. Anyone
eating it is cut off.’ 
Lev
17:15  “And any being who eats a carcass
or what was torn by a beast, be he a
native or a stranger, he shall wash his garments and bathe in water, and shall
be unclean until evening. Then he shall be clean. 
Lev
17:16  “And if he does not wash or bathe
his body, then he shall bear his crookedness.” 
Lev
18:1  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying,
Lev
18:2  “Speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl,
and say to them, ‘I am יהוה your Elohim. 
Lev
18:3  ‘Do not do as they do in the land
of Mitsrayim, where you dwelt. And do not do as they do in the land of Kena‛an,
where I am bringing you, and do not walk in their laws.

laws, to walk in them. I am יהוה your Elohim. 
Lev

right-rulings, which a man does and lives by them. I am יהוה.

18:6  ‘No one is to approach anyone of
his own flesh to uncover his nakedness. I am יהוה. 
Lev

the nakedness of your mother you do not uncover. She is your mother, you do not
uncover her nakedness. 
Lev
18:8  ‘The nakedness of your father’s
wife you do not uncover, it is your father’s nakedness. 
Lev
18:9  ‘The nakedness of your sister, the
daughter of your father, or the daughter of your mother, whether born at home
or elsewhere, their nakedness you do not uncover. 
Lev
18:10  ‘The nakedness of your son’s
daughter or your daughter’s daughter, their nakedness you do not uncover, for
theirs is your own nakedness. 
Lev
18:11  ‘The nakedness of your father’s
wife’s daughter, brought forth by your father, she is your sister, you do not
uncover her nakedness. 
Lev
18:12  ‘The nakedness of your father’s
sister you do not uncover, she is your father’s flesh.

sister you do not uncover, for she is your mother’s flesh.

brother you do not uncover, you do not approach his wife, she is your aunt. 
Lev

daughter-in-law you do not uncover, she is your son’s wife, you do not uncover
her nakedness. 
Lev
18:16  ‘The nakedness of your brother’s
wife you do not uncover, it is your brother’s nakedness. 
Lev
18:17  ‘The nakedness of a woman and her
daughter you do not uncover, nor do you take her son’s daughter or her daughter’s
daughter, to uncover her nakedness. They are her relatives – it is wickedness. 
Lev
18:18  ‘And do not take a woman as a
rival to her sister, to uncover her nakedness while the other is alive. 
Lev
18:19  ‘And do not approach a woman to
uncover her nakedness in her monthly separation of uncleanness. 
Lev
18:20  ‘And do not have intercourse with
the wife of your neighbour, to defile yourself with her.

any beast, to defile yourself with it. And a woman does not stand before a
beast to mate with it, it is a perversion. 
Lev
18:24  ‘Do not defile yourselves with all
these, for by all these the nations are defiled, which I am driving out before
you. 
Lev
18:25  ‘Thus the land became defiled,
therefore I punished it for its crookedness, and the land vomited out its
inhabitants. 
Lev
18:26  ‘But you, you shall guard My laws
and My right-rulings, and not do any of these abominations, the native nor
stranger who sojourns among you,

were before you have done all these abominations, and thus the land became
defiled,

for defiling it, as it vomited out the nations that were before you. 
Lev

abominations, those beings who do them shall be cut off from among their
people.

as not to do any of these abominable practices which were done before you, so
as not to defile yourselves by them. I am יהוה your
Elohim.’ ” 
Lev
19:1  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying,
Lev
19:2  “Speak to all the congregation of
the children of Yisra’ĕl, and say to them, ‘Be set-apart, for I יהוה

third day, it is abominable, it is not accepted, 
Lev

‘Any man of the children of Yisra’ĕl, or of the strangers who sojourn in
Yisra’ĕl, who gives any of his offspring to Moleḵ, shall certainly

20:10  ‘And a man who commits adultery
with the wife of another man, who commits adultery with the wife of his
neighbour: the adulterer and the adulteress shall certainly be put to death. 
Lev
20:11  ‘And a man who lies with the wife

said to Mosheh, “Speak to the priests, the sons of Aharon, and say to them: ‘No
one is to be defiled for the dead among his people, 
Lev

nearest to him: for his mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for
his daughter, and for his brother; 
Lev
21:3  and for his maiden sister who is
near to him, who has had no husband – for her he is defiled. 
Lev
21:4  ‘A leader does not defile himself
among his people, to profane himself; 
Lev
21:5  they do not make any bald place on
their heads, and they do not shave the corner of their beard, and they do not
make a cutting in their flesh. 
Lev
21:6  ‘They are set-apart to their Elohim
and do not profane the Name of their Elohim, for they bring the offerings of יהוה
made by fire, and the bread of their Elohim, and shall be set-apart. 
Lev
21:7  ‘They do not take a woman who is a
whore or a defiled woman, and they do not take a woman put away from her
husband, for he is set-apart to his Elohim. 
Lev
21:8  ‘And you shall set him apart, for
he brings the bread of your Elohim, he is set-apart to you. For I, יהוה,
setting you apart, am set-apart. 
Lev
21:9  ‘And when the daughter of any
priest profanes herself by whoring, she profanes her father. She is burned with
fire. 
Lev
21:10  ‘And the high priest among his
brothers, on whose head the anointing oil was poured and who is ordained to
wear the garments, does not unbind his head nor tear his garments, 
Lev
21:11  nor come near any dead body, nor
defile himself for his father or his mother, 
Lev
21:12  nor go out of the set-apart place,
nor profane the set-apart place of his Elohim, for the sign of dedication of
the anointing oil of his Elohim is upon him. I am יהוה.

Lev
21:13  ‘And let him take a wife in her
maidenhood. 
Lev
21:14  ‘A widow or one put away or a
defiled woman or a whore – these he does not take. But a maiden of his own
people he does take as a wife. 
Lev
21:15  ‘And he does not profane his
offspring among his people, for I am יהוה, who sets him
apart.’ ” 
Lev
21:16  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying, 
Lev
21:17  “Speak to Aharon, saying, ‘No man
of your offspring throughout their generations, who has any defect, is to draw
near to bring the bread of his Elohim. 
Lev
21:18  ‘For any man who has a defect is
not to draw near: a man blind or one lame or disfigured or deformed, 
Lev
21:19  a man who has a broken foot or
broken hand, 
Lev
21:20  or is a hunchback or a dwarf, or a
man who has a defect in his eye, or eczema or scab, or is a eunuch. 
Lev
21:21  ‘No man among the offspring of
Aharon the priest, who has a defect, is to come near to bring the offerings
made by fire to יהוה – he has a defect, he does not
come near to bring the bread of his Elohim. 
Lev
21:22  ‘He does eat the bread of his
Elohim, both the most set-apart and the set-apart, 
Lev
21:23  only, he does not go near the veil
or approach the altar, because he has a defect, lest he profanes My set-apart
places. For I am יהוה, who sets them apart.’ ” 
Lev
21:24  Thus Mosheh spoke to Aharon and
his sons, and to all the children of Yisra’ĕl. 
Lev
22:1  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying,
Lev
22:2  “Speak to Aharon and his sons, that
they separate themselves from the set-apart offerings
of the children of Yisra’ĕl, and that they do not profane My set-apart Name
in what they set apart to Me. I am יהוה. 
Lev
22:3  “Say to them, ‘Any man of all your
offspring throughout your generations who draws near the set-apart offerings which the children of Yisra’ĕl
set apart to יהוה, while he has uncleanness upon him,
that being shall be cut off from before Me. I am יהוה. 
Lev
22:4  ‘Any man of the offspring of
Aharon, who is a leper or has a discharge, does not eat the set-apart offerings until he is clean. And whoever
touches what is rendered unclean by a corpse, or a man who has had an emission
of semen, 
Lev
22:5  or a man who touches any creeping
creature by which he would be made unclean, or any being by whom he would
become unclean, even any of his uncleanness; 
Lev
22:6  the being who has touched it shall
be unclean until evening, and does not eat the set-apart offerings, but shall bathe his body in water. 
Lev
22:7  ‘And when the sun goes down he
shall be clean, and afterward eat the set-apart offerings, because it is his food. 
Lev
22:8  ‘He does not eat that which dies or
is torn by beasts, becoming unclean
by it. I am יהוה. 
Lev
22:9  ‘And they shall guard My Charge,
lest they bear sin for it and die thereby, when they profane it. I יהוה
set them apart. 
Lev
22:10  ‘And no stranger eats the
set-apart offering. A sojourner with the priest, or a hired servant, does not
eat the set-apart offering. 
Lev
22:11  ‘But when the priest buys a being
with his money, he does eat of it. And one who is born in his house does eat
his food. 
Lev
22:12  ‘And when a priest’s daughter is
married to a stranger, she does not eat of the set-apart offerings. 
Lev
22:13  ‘But when a priest’s daughter is a
widow or put away, and has no child, and has returned to her father’s house as
in her youth, she does eat her father’s food, but no stranger eats of it. 
Lev
22:14  ‘And when a man eats the set-apart
offering by mistake, then he shall give a set-apart offering to the priest, and
add one-fifth to it. 
Lev
22:15  ‘And let the priests not profane the set-apart offerings of the children of
Yisra’ĕl, which they lift up to יהוה, 
Lev
22:16  or allow them to bear the
crookedness of trespass when they eat their set-apart offerings. For I am יהוה,
who sets them apart.’ ” 
Lev
22:17  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying, 
Lev
22:18  “Speak to Aharon and his sons, and
to all the children of Yisra’ĕl, and say to them, ‘Any man of the house of
Yisra’ĕl, or of the strangers in Yisra’ĕl, who brings his offering
for any of his vows or for any of his voluntary offerings, which they bring to יהוה
as a burnt offering, 
Lev
22:19  for your acceptance, is a male, a
perfect one from the cattle, from the sheep, or from the goats. 
Lev
22:20  ‘Whatever has a defect, you do not
bring, for it is not acceptable for you. 
Lev
22:21  ‘And when a man brings a peace
offering to יהוה, to complete a vow, or a voluntary
offering from the cattle or the sheep, it is to be perfect to be accepted, let
there be no defect in it. 
Lev
22:22  ‘Those blind or broken or having a
cut, or have an ulcer or eczema or scabs, you do not bring to יהוה,
nor make an offering by fire of them on the altar to יהוה.

Lev
22:23  ‘As for a bull or a lamb that has
any limb deformed or dwarfed you do prepare as a voluntary offering, but for a
vow it is not accepted. 
Lev
22:24  ‘Do not bring to יהוה
what is bruised or crushed, or torn or cut, nor do it in your land. 
Lev
22:25  ‘And from a son of a stranger’s
hand you do not bring any of these as the bread of your Elohim, for their
corruption is in them, and defects are in them, they are not acceptable for you.’
” 
Lev
22:26  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying, 
Lev
22:27  “When a bull or a sheep or a goat
is born, it shall be seven days with its mother. And from the eighth day and
thereafter it is acceptable as an offering made by fire to יהוה.

Lev
22:28  “But do not slaughter a cow or a
sheep and its young on the same day. 
Lev
22:29  “And when you bring a slaughtering
of thanksgiving to יהוה, bring it for your acceptance. 
Lev
22:30  “It is eaten that same day, leave
none of it till morning. I am יהוה. 
Lev
22:31  “And you shall guard My commands
and do them. I am יהוה. 
Lev
22:32  “And do not profane My set-apart
Name, and I shall be set-apart among the children of Yisra’ĕl. I am יהוה,
who sets you apart, 
Lev
22:33  who brought you out of the land of
Mitsrayim, to be your Elohim. I am יהוה.” 
Lev
23:1  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying,
Lev
23:2  “Speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl,
and say to them, ‘The appointed times of יהוה, which
you are to proclaim as set-apart gatherings, My appointed times, are these: 
Lev
23:3  ‘Six days work is done, but the
seventh day is a Sabbath of rest, a set-apart gathering. You do no work, it is
a Sabbath to יהוה in all your dwellings. 
Lev
23:4  ‘These are the appointed times of יהוה,
set-apart gatherings which you are to proclaim at their appointed times. 
Lev
23:5  ‘In the first month, on the
fourteenth day of the month, between the evenings, is the Passover to יהוה.

Lev
23:6  ‘And on the fifteenth day of this
month is the Festival of Unleavened Bread to יהוה –
seven days you eat unleavened bread. 
Lev
23:7  ‘On the first day you have a
set-apart gathering, you do no servile work. 
Lev
23:8  ‘And you shall bring an offering
made by fire to יהוה for seven days. On the seventh day
is a set-apart gathering, you do no servile work.’ ” 
Lev
23:9  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying, 
Lev
23:10  “Speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl,
and you shall say to them, ‘When you come into the land which I give you, and
shall reap its harvest, then you shall bring a sheaf of the first-fruits of
your harvest to the priest. 
Lev
23:11  ‘And he shall wave the sheaf
before יהוה, for your acceptance. On the morrow after
the Sabbath the priest waves it. 
Lev
23:12  ‘And on that day when you wave the
sheaf, you shall prepare a male lamb a year old, a perfect one, as a burnt
offering to יהוה, 
Lev
23:13  and its grain offering: two-tenths
of an ĕphah of fine flour mixed with oil, an offering made by fire to יהוה,
a sweet fragrance, and its drink offering: one-fourth of a hin of wine. 
Lev
23:14  ‘And you do not eat bread or
roasted grain or fresh grain until the same day that you have brought an
offering to your Elohim – a law forever throughout your generations in all your
dwellings. 
Lev
23:15  ‘And from the morrow after the
Sabbath, from the day that you brought the sheaf of the wave offering, you
shall count for yourselves: seven completed Sabbaths. 
Lev
23:16  ‘Until the morrow after the
seventh Sabbath you count fifty days, then you shall bring a new grain offering
to יהוה. 
Lev
23:17  ‘Bring from your dwellings for a
wave offering two loaves of bread, of
two-tenths of an ĕphah of fine flour they are, baked with leaven,
first-fruits to יהוה. 
Lev
23:18  ‘And besides the bread, you shall
bring seven lambs a year old, perfect ones, and one young bull and two rams.
They are a burnt offering to יהוה, with their grain
offering and their drink offerings, an offering made by fire for a sweet
fragrance to יהוה. 
Lev
23:19  ‘And you shall offer one male goat
as a sin offering, and two male lambs a year old, as a peace offering. 
Lev
23:20  ‘And the priest shall wave them,
besides the bread of the first-fruits, as a wave offering before יהוה,
besides the two lambs. They are set-apart to יהוה for
the priest. 
Lev
23:21  ‘And on this same day you shall
proclaim a set-apart gathering for yourselves, you do no servile work on it – a
law forever in all your dwellings throughout your generations. 
Lev
23:22  ‘And when you reap the harvest of
your land do not completely reap the corners of your field when you reap, and do
not gather any gleaning from your harvest. Leave them for the poor and for the
stranger. I am יהוה your Elohim.’ ” 
Lev
23:23  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying, 
Lev
23:24  “Speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl,
saying, ‘In the seventh month, on the first day of the month, you have a rest,
a remembrance of blowing of trumpets, a set-apart gathering. 
Lev
23:25  ‘You do no servile work, and you
shall bring an offering made by fire to יהוה.’ ” 
Lev
23:26  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying, 
Lev
23:27  “On the tenth day of this seventh
month is the Day of Atonement. It shall be a set-apart gathering for you. And
you shall afflict your beings, and shall bring an offering made by fire to יהוה.

Lev
23:28  “And you do no work on that same
day, for it is the Day of Atonement, to make atonement for you before יהוה
your Elohim. 
Lev
23:29  “For any being who is not
afflicted on that same day, he shall be cut off from his people. 
Lev
23:30  “And any being who does any work
on that same day, that being I shall destroy from the midst of his people. 
Lev
23:31  “You do no work – a law forever
throughout your generations in all your dwellings. 
Lev
23:32  ‘It is a Sabbath of rest to you,
and you shall afflict your beings. On the ninth day of the month at evening,
from evening to evening, you observe your Sabbath.” 
Lev
23:33  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying, 
Lev
23:34  “Speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl,
saying, ‘On the fifteenth day of this seventh month is the Festival of Booths
for seven days to יהוה. 
Lev
23:35  ‘On the first day is a set-apart
gathering, you do no servile work. 
Lev
23:36  ‘For seven days you bring an
offering made by fire to יהוה. On the eighth day there
shall be a set-apart gathering for you, and you shall bring an offering made by
fire to יהוה. It is a closing festival, you do no
servile work. 
Lev
23:37  ‘These are the appointed times of יהוה
which you proclaim as set-apart gatherings, to bring an offering made by fire
to יהוה, a burnt offering and a grain offering, a
slaughtering and drink offerings, as commanded for every day – 
Lev
23:38  besides the Sabbaths of יהוה,
and besides your gifts, and besides all your vows, and besides all your
voluntary offerings which you give to יהוה. 
Lev
23:39  ‘On the fifteenth day of the
seventh month, when you gather in the fruit of the land, observe the festival
of יהוה for seven days. On the first day is a rest, and
on the eighth day a rest. 
Lev
23:40  ‘And you shall take for yourselves
on the first day the fruit of good trees, branches of palm trees, twigs of
leafy trees, and willows of the stream, and shall rejoice before יהוה
your Elohim for seven days. 
Lev
23:41  ‘And you shall observe it as a
festival to יהוה for seven days in the year – a law
forever in your generations. Observe it in the seventh month. 
Lev
23:42  ‘Dwell in booths for seven days;
all who are native Yisra’ĕlites dwell in booths, 
Lev
23:43  so that your generations know that
I made the children of Yisra’ĕl dwell in booths when I brought them out of
the land of Mitsrayim. I am יהוה your Elohim.’ ” 
Lev
23:44  Thus did Mosheh speak of the
appointed times of יהוה to the children of Yisra’ĕl.

Lev
24:1  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying,
Lev
24:2  “Command the children of Yisra’ĕl
that they bring to you clear oil of pressed olives for the light, to make the
lamps burn continually. 
Lev
24:3  “Outside the veil of the Witness,
in the Tent of Meeting, Aharon is to arrange it from evening until morning
before יהוה continually – a law forever throughout your
generations. 
Lev
24:4  “He is to arrange the lamps on the
clean gold lampstand before יהוה continually. 
Lev
24:5  “And you shall take fine flour and
bake twelve cakes with it, two-tenths of
an ĕphah in each cake. 
Lev
24:6  “And you shall set them in two
rows, six in a row, on the clean table before יהוה. 
Lev
24:7  “And you shall put clear
frankincense on each row, and it shall be on the bread as a remembrance
portion, an offering made by fire to יהוה. 
Lev
24:8  “On every Sabbath he is to arrange
it before יהוה continually, from the children of Yisra’ĕl
– an everlasting covenant. 
Lev
24:9  “And it shall be for Aharon and his
sons, and they shall eat it in the set-apart place, because it is most
set-apart to him from the offerings of יהוה made by
fire – an everlasting law.” 
Lev
24:10  And the son of an Yisra’ĕlite
woman, whose father was a Mitsrite, went out among the children of Yisra’ĕl.
And the Yisra’ĕlite woman’s son and a man of Yisra’ĕl strove in the
camp. 
Lev
24:11  And the Yisra’ĕlite woman’s
son blasphemed the Name, and cursed. So they brought him to Mosheh. Now his
mother’s name was Shelomith the daughter of Diḇri, of the tribe of Dan. 
Lev
24:12  And they put him in under guard,
that it might be declared to them at the mouth of יהוה.

Lev
24:13  And יהוה spoke
to Mosheh, saying, 
Lev
24:14  “Bring the one who has cursed
outside the camp, and all those who heard him shall lay their hands on his
head, and all the congregation shall stone him. 
Lev
24:15  “And speak to the children of
Yisra’ĕl, saying, ‘Anyone who curses his Elohim shall bear his sin. 
Lev
24:16  ‘And he who blasphemes the Name of
יהוה shall certainly be put to death, and all the
congregation certainly stone him, the stranger as well as the native. When he
blasphemes the Name, he is put to death. 
Lev
24:17  ‘And he who smites the life from
any man shall certainly be put to death. 
Lev
24:18  ‘And he who smites a beast repays
it, body for body. 
Lev
24:19  ‘And when a man inflicts a blemish
upon his neighbour, as he has done so it is done to him: 
Lev
24:20  ‘Fracture for fracture, eye for
eye, tooth for tooth; as he inflicts a blemish upon him, so it is done to him. 
Lev
24:21  ‘And he who smites a beast repays
it, and he who smites a man to death
is put to death. 
Lev
24:22  ‘You are to have one right-ruling,
for the stranger and for the native, for I am יהוה your
Elohim.’ ” 
Lev
24:23  And Mosheh spoke to the children
of Yisra’ĕl, and they brought the one who cursed outside the camp, and
stoned him with stones. And the children of Yisra’ĕl did as יהוה
commanded Mosheh. 
Lev
25:1  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh on Mount Sinai, saying, 
Lev
25:2  “Speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl,
and say to them, ‘When you come into the land which I give you, then the land
shall observe a Sabbath to יהוה. 
Lev
25:3  ‘Six years you sow your field, and
six years you prune your vineyard, and gather in its fruit, 
Lev
25:4  but in the seventh year the land is
to have a Sabbath of rest, a Sabbath to יהוה. Do not
sow your field and do not prune your vineyard. 
Lev
25:5  ‘Do not reap what grows of its own
of your harvest, and do not gather the grapes of your unpruned vine, for it is
a year of rest for the land. 
Lev
25:6  ‘And the Sabbath of the land shall
be to you for food, for you and your servant, and for your female servant and
your hired servant, and for the stranger who sojourns with you, 
Lev
25:7  and for your livestock and the
beasts that are in your land. All its crops are for food. 
Lev
25:8  ‘And you shall count seven Sabbaths
of years for yourself, seven times seven years. And the time of the seven
Sabbaths of years shall be to you forty-nine years. 
Lev
25:9  ‘You shall then sound a ram’s horn
to pass through on the tenth day of the seventh month, on the Day of Atonement
cause a ram’s horn to pass through all your land. 
Lev
25:10  ‘And you shall set the fiftieth
year apart, and proclaim release throughout all the land to all its
inhabitants, it is a Jubilee for you. And each of you shall return to his
possession, and each of you return to his clan. 
Lev
25:11  ‘The fiftieth year is a Jubilee to
you. Do not sow, nor reap what grows of its own, nor gather from its unpruned
vine. 
Lev
25:12  ‘It is a Jubilee, it is set-apart
to you. Eat from the field its crops. 
Lev
25:13  ‘In the Year of this Jubilee let
each one of you return to his possession. 
Lev
25:14  ‘And when you sell whatever to
your neighbour or buy from the hand of your neighbour, do not exploit one
another. 
Lev
25:15  ‘According to the number of years
after the Jubilee you buy from your neighbour, and according to the number of
years of crops he sells to you. 
Lev
25:16  ‘According to the greater number
of years you increase its price, and according to the fewer number of years you
diminish its price, because he sells to you according to the number of the
years of the crops. 
Lev
25:17  ‘And do not oppress one another,
but you shall fear your Elohim. For I am יהוה your
Elohim. 
Lev
25:18  ‘And you shall do My laws and
guard My right-rulings, and shall do them. And you shall dwell in the land in
safety, 
Lev
25:19  ‘and the land shall yield its
fruit, and you shall eat to satisfaction, and shall dwell there in safety. 
Lev
25:20  ‘And since you might say, “What do
we eat in the seventh year, since we do not sow nor gather in our crops?” 
Lev
25:21  ‘Therefore I have commanded My
blessing on you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth the crop for three
years. 
Lev
25:22  ‘And you shall sow in the eighth
year, and eat of the old crop until the ninth year. Eat of the old until its
crop comes in. 
Lev
25:23  ‘And the land is not to be sold
beyond reclaim, for the land is Mine, for you are sojourners and settlers with
Me. 
Lev
25:24  ‘And provide for a redemption for
the land, in all the land of your possession. 
Lev
25:25  ‘When your brother becomes poor,
and has sold some of his possession, and his redeemer, a close relative comes
to redeem it, then he shall redeem what his brother sold. 
Lev
25:26  ‘And when the man has no one to
redeem it, but he himself becomes able to redeem it, 
Lev
25:27  then let him count the years since
its sale, and return the remainder to the man to whom he sold it, that he shall
return to his possession. 
Lev
25:28  ‘And if his hand has not found
enough to give back to him, then what was sold shall remain in the hand of him
who bought it until the Year of Jubilee. And it shall be released in the
Jubilee, and he shall return to his possession. 
Lev
25:29  ‘And when a man sells a house in a
walled city, then his right of redemption shall be at the end of the year after
it is sold. His right of redemption lasts a year. 
Lev
25:30  ‘But if it is not redeemed within
a complete year, then the house in the walled city shall be established beyond
reclaim to the buyer of it, throughout his generations. It is not released in
the Jubilee. 
Lev
25:31  ‘The houses of villages, however,
which have no wall around them are reckoned as the field of the country. A
right of redemption belongs to it, and they are released in the Jubilee. 
Lev
25:32  ‘As for the cities of the Lĕwites,
and the houses in the cities of their possession, the Lĕwites have a right
of redemption forever. 
Lev
25:33  ‘And that which is redeemed from
the Lĕwites, both the sale of a house and the city of his possession shall
be released in the Year of Jubilee, because the houses in the cities of the Lĕwites
are their possession in the midst of the children of Yisra’ĕl.  
Lev
25:34  ‘But the field of the open land of
their cities is not sold, for it is their everlasting possession. 
Lev
25:35  ‘And when your brother becomes
poor, and his hand has failed with you, then you shall sustain him, and he
shall live with you, like a stranger or a sojourner. 
Lev
25:36  ‘Take no interest from him, or
profit, but you shall fear your Elohim, and your brother shall live with you. 
Lev
25:37  ‘Do not lend him your silver on
interest, and do not lend him your food for profit. 
Lev
25:38  ‘I am יהוה
your Elohim, who brought you out of the land of Mitsrayim, to give you the land
of Kena‛an, to be your Elohim. 
Lev
25:39  ‘And when your brother who dwells
by you becomes poor, and sells himself to you, do not make him serve as a
slave. 
Lev
25:40  ‘But as a hired servant, as a
settler he is with you, and serves you until the Year of Jubilee. 
Lev
25:41  ‘And then he shall leave you, he
and his children with him, and shall return to his own clan, even return to the
possession of his fathers. 
Lev
25:42  ‘For they are My servants, whom I
brought out of the land of Mitsrayim, they are not sold as slaves. 
Lev
25:43  ‘Do not rule over him with
harshness, but you shall fear your Elohim. 
Lev
25:44  ‘And your male and female slaves
whom you have from the nations that are around you, from them you buy male and
female slaves, 
Lev
25:45  and also from the sons of the strangers
sojourning among you, from them you buy, and from their clans who are with you,
which they shall bring forth in your land, and they shall be your property. 
Lev
25:46  ‘And you shall take them as an
inheritance for your children after you, to inherit them as a possession, they
are your slaves for all time. But over your brothers, the children of Yisra’ĕl,
you do not rule with harshness, one over another. 
Lev
25:47  ‘Now when a sojourner or a settler
with you becomes rich, and your brother with him becomes poor, and sells
himself to the settler or sojourner with you, or to a member of the sojourner’s
clan, 
Lev
25:48  after he has been sold, there is a
right of redemption to him – one of his brothers does redeem him, 
Lev
25:49  or his uncle or his uncle’s son
does redeem him, or anyone who is a close relative to him in his clan does
redeem him, or if he is able, then he shall redeem himself. 
Lev
25:50  ‘And he shall reckon with him who
bought him: The price of his release shall be according to the number of years,
from the year that he was sold to him until the Year of Jubilee; as the days of
a hired servant it is with him. 
Lev
25:51  ‘If there are yet many years,
according to them he repays the price of his redemption, from the silver of his
purchase. 
Lev
25:52  ‘And if few years are left until
the Year of Jubilee, then he shall reckon with him, and according to his years
he repays him the price of his redemption. 
Lev
25:53  ‘He is with him as a yearly hired
servant, and he does not rule with harshness over him before your eyes. 
Lev
25:54  ‘And if he is not redeemed in
these years, then he shall be released in the Year of Jubilee, he and his
children with him. 
Lev
25:55  ‘Because the children of Yisra’ĕl
are servants to Me, they are My servants whom I brought out of the land of
Mitsrayim. I am יהוה your Elohim. 
Lev
26:1  ‘Do not make idols for yourselves,
and do not set up a carved image or a pillar for yourselves, and do not place a
stone image in your land, to bow down to it. For I am יהוה
your Elohim. 
Lev
26:2  ‘Guard My Sabbaths and reverence My
set-apart place. I am יהוה. 
Lev
26:3  ‘If you walk in My laws and guard
My commands, and shall do them, 
Lev
26:4  then I shall give you rain in its
season, and the land shall yield its crops, and the trees of the field yield
their fruit. 
Lev
26:5  ‘And your threshing shall last till
the time of the grape harvest, and the grape harvest shall last till the time
of sowing. And you shall eat your bread until you have enough, and shall dwell
in your land safely. 
Lev
26:6  ‘And I shall give peace in the
land, and you shall lie down and no one make you afraid. And I shall clear the
land of evil beasts, and not let the sword go through your land. 
Lev
26:7  ‘And you shall pursue your enemies,
and they shall fall by the sword before you. 
Lev
26:8  ‘And five of you shall pursue a
hundred, and a hundred of you pursue ten thousand. And your enemies shall fall
by the sword before you. 
Lev
26:9  ‘And I shall turn to you and make
you bear fruit, and shall increase you, and shall establish My covenant with
you. 
Lev
26:10  ‘And you shall eat the old supply,
and clear out the old because of the new. 
Lev
26:11  ‘And I shall set My Dwelling Place
in your midst, and My being shall not reject you. 
Lev
26:12  ‘And I shall walk in your midst,
and shall be your Elohim, and you shall be My people. 
Lev
26:13  ‘I am יהוה
your Elohim, who brought you out of the land of Mitsrayim, from being their
slaves. And I have broken the bars of your yoke and made you walk upright. 
Lev
26:14  ‘But if you do not obey Me, and do
not do all these commands, 
Lev
26:15  and if you reject My laws, or if
your being loathes My right-rulings, so that you do not do all My commands, but
break My covenant, 
Lev
26:16  I also do this to you: And I shall
appoint sudden alarm over you, wasting disease and inflammation, destroying the
eyes, and consuming the life. And you shall sow your seed in vain, for your
enemies shall eat it. 
Lev
26:17  ‘And I shall set My face against
you, and you shall be smitten before your enemies. And those who hate you shall
rule over you, and you shall flee when no one pursues you. 
Lev
26:18  ‘And after all this, if you do not
obey Me, then I shall punish you seven times more for your sins. 
Lev
26:19  ‘And I shall break the pride of
your power, and shall make your heavens like iron and your earth like bronze. 
Lev
26:20  ‘And your strength shall be spent
in vain and your land not yield its crops, nor the trees of the land yield
their fruit. 
Lev
26:21  ‘And if you walk contrary to Me,
and refuse to obey Me, I shall bring on you seven times more plagues, according
to your sins, 
Lev
26:22  and send wild beasts among you,
which shall bereave you of your children. And I shall cut off your livestock,
and make you few in number, and your highways shall be deserted. 
Lev
26:23  ‘And if you are not instructed by
Me by these, but walk contrary to Me, 
Lev
26:24  then I also shall walk contrary to
you, and I Myself shall smite you seven times for your sins. 
Lev
26:25  ‘And I shall bring against you a
sword executing the vengeance of My covenant, and you shall gather together in
your cities, and I shall send pestilence among you, and you shall be given into
the hand of the enemy. 
Lev
26:26  ‘When I have cut off your supply
of bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall bring
back to you your bread by weight, and you shall eat and not be satisfied. 
Lev
26:27  ‘And if in spite of this, you do
not obey Me, but walk contrary to Me, 
Lev
26:28  then I shall walk contrary to you
in wrath. And I Myself shall punish you seven times for your sins. 
Lev
26:29  ‘And you shall eat the flesh of
your sons, and eat the flesh of your daughters. 
Lev
26:30  ‘And I shall destroy your high
places, and cut down your sun-pillars, and put your carcasses on the carcasses
of your idols. And My being shall loathe you. 
Lev
26:31  ‘And I shall turn your cities into
ruins and lay your set-apart places waste, and not smell your sweet fragrances.

Lev
26:32  ‘And I shall lay the land waste,
and your enemies who dwell in it shall be astonished at it. 
Lev
26:33  ‘And I shall scatter you among the
gentiles and draw out a sword after you. And your land shall be desert and your
cities ruins, 
Lev
26:34  and the land enjoy its Sabbaths as
long as it lies waste and you are in your enemies’ land. Then the land would
rest and enjoy its Sabbaths. 
Lev
26:35  ‘As long as it lies waste it
rests, for the time it did not rest on your Sabbaths when you dwelt in it. 
Lev
26:36  ‘And as for those of you who are
left, I shall send faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies,
and the sound of a shaken leaf shall cause them to flee. And they shall flee as
though retreating from a sword, and they shall fall when no one pursues. 
Lev
26:37  ‘And they shall stumble over one
another, as from before a sword, when no one pursues. And you shall be unable
to stand before your enemies. 
Lev
26:38  ‘And you shall perish among the
gentiles, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up, 
Lev
26:39  and those of you who are left rot
away in their crookedness in your enemies’ lands, and also in their fathers’
crookednesses rot away with them. 
Lev
26:40  ‘But if they confess their
crookedness and the crookedness of their fathers, with their trespass in which
they trespassed against Me, and that they also have walked contrary to Me, 
Lev
26:41  and that I also have walked
contrary to them and have brought them into the land of their enemies – if
their uncircumcised heart is then humbled, and they accept the punishment of
their crookedness, 
Lev
26:42  then I shall remember My covenant
with Ya‛aqoḇ, and also My covenant with Yitsḥaq, and also
remember My covenant with Aḇraham, and remember the land. 
Lev
26:43  ‘For the land was abandoned by
them, and enjoying its Sabbaths while lying waste without them, and they were
paying for their crookedness, because they rejected My right-rulings and
because their being loathed My laws. 
Lev
26:44  ‘And yet for all this, when they
are in the land of their enemies, I shall not reject them, nor shall I loathe
them so as to destroy them and break My covenant with them. For I am יהוה
their Elohim. 
Lev
26:45  ‘Then I shall remember for their
sake the covenant of the ancestors whom I brought out of the land of Mitsrayim
before the eyes of the nations to be their Elohim. I am יהוה.’
” 
Lev
26:46  These are the laws and the
right-rulings and the Torot which יהוה made between
Himself and the children of Yisra’ĕl on Mount Sinai by the hand of Mosheh.
Lev
27:1  And יהוה spoke
to Mosheh, saying,
Lev
27:2  “Speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl,
and say to them, ‘When a man separates a vow, by your evaluation of lives unto יהוה,

Lev
27:3  when your evaluation is of a male
from twenty years old up to sixty years old, then your evaluation shall be
fifty sheqels of silver, according to the sheqel of the set-apart place. 
Lev
27:4  ‘And if it is a female, then your
evaluation shall be thirty sheqels; 
Lev
27:5  and if from five years old up to
twenty years old, then your evaluation for a male shall be twenty sheqels, and
for a female ten sheqels; 
Lev
27:6  and if from a month old up to five
years old, then your evaluation for a male shall be five sheqels of silver, and
for a female your evaluation shall be three sheqels of silver; 
Lev
27:7  and if from sixty years old and
above, if it is a male, then your evaluation shall be fifteen sheqels, and for
a female ten sheqels. 
Lev
27:8  ‘But if he is too poor to pay your
evaluation, then he shall present himself before the priest, and the priest
shall set a value for him. According to the ability of him who vowed, the
priest shall value him. 
Lev
27:9  ‘And if it is a beast of which they
bring an offering to יהוה, all such given to יהוה
is set-apart. 
Lev
27:10  ‘He is not to replace it or
exchange it, good for spoilt or spoilt for good. And if he at all exchanges
beast for beast, then both it and the one exchanged for it is set-apart. 
Lev
27:11  ‘And if it is any unclean beast of
which they do not bring an offering to יהוה, then he
shall present the beast before the priest; 
Lev
27:12  and the priest shall value it,
whether it is good or spoilt. According to your evaluation, O priest, so it
shall be. 
Lev
27:13  ‘But if he indeed redeems it, then
he shall add one-fifth to your evaluation. 
Lev
27:14  ‘And when a man sets his house
apart, to be set-apart to יהוה, then the priest shall
value it, whether it is good or spoilt. As the priest values it, so it stands. 
Lev
27:15  ‘And if he who sets it apart does
redeem his house, then he shall add one-fifth of the silver of your evaluation
to it, and it shall be his. 
Lev
27:16  ‘And if a man sets apart to יהוה
a field he owns, then your evaluation shall be according to the seed for it – a
ḥomer of barley seed at fifty sheqels of silver. 
Lev
27:17  ‘If he sets his field apart from
the Year of Jubilee, according to your evaluation it stands. 
Lev
27:18  ‘But if he sets his field apart
after the Jubilee, then the priest shall reckon to him the silver due according
to the years that remain till the Year of Jubilee, and it shall be deducted
from your evaluation. 
Lev
27:19  ‘And if he who sets the field
apart ever wishes to redeem it, then he shall add one-fifth of the silver of
your evaluation to it, and it shall be his. 
Lev
27:20  ‘And if he does not redeem the
field, or if he has sold the field to another man, it is no longer redeemed, 
Lev
27:21  but the field, when it is released
in the Jubilee, is set-apart to יהוה as a dedicated field,
to be the possession of the priest. 
Lev
27:22  ‘And if a man sets apart to יהוה
a field which he has bought, which is not the field of his possession, 
Lev
27:23  then the priest shall reckon to
him the amount of your evaluation, up to the Year of Jubilee, and he shall give
your evaluation on that day, set-apart to יהוה. 
Lev
27:24  ‘In the Year of Jubilee the field
returns to him from whom he bought it, to him whose is the possession of the
land. 
Lev
27:25  ‘And all your evaluations is to be
according to the sheqel of the set-apart place: twenty gĕrahs to the
sheqel. 
Lev
27:26  ‘However, a first-born of the
beasts, which is first-born to יהוה, no man sets it
apart – whether bull or sheep, it belongs to יהוה. 
Lev
27:27  ‘And if among the unclean beasts,
then he shall ransom it according to your evaluation, and shall add one-fifth
to it. And if it is not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to your
evaluation. 
Lev
27:28  ‘However, whatever a man lays
under ban for יהוה of all that he has, man and beast,
or the field of his possession, is not sold or redeemed. Whatever is laid under
ban is most set-apart to יהוה. 
Lev
27:29  ‘No one under the ban, under the
ban among men, is ransomed, but shall certainly be put to death. 
Lev
27:30  ‘And all the tithe of the land –
of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the tree – belongs to יהוה.
It is set-apart to יהוה. 
Lev
27:31  ‘If a man indeed redeems any of
his tithes, he adds one-fifth to it. 
Lev
27:32  ‘And the entire tithe of the herd
and of the flock, all that passes under the rod, the tenth one is set-apart to יהוה.

Lev
27:33  ‘He does not inquire whether it is
good or spoilt, nor does he exchange it. And if he exchanges it at all, then
both it and the one exchanged for it are set-apart, it is not redeemed.’ ” 
Lev
27:34  These are the commands which יהוה
commanded Mosheh for the children of Yisra’ĕl on Mount Sinai.
