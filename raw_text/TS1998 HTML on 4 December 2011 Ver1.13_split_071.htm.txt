Kĕpha Aleph/1 Peter
1Pet
1:1  Kĕpha, an emissary of יהושע
Messiah, to the chosen, strangers of the dispersion in Pontos, Galatia,
Kappadokia, Asia, and Bithunia, 
1Pet
1:2  chosen according to the
foreknowledge of Elohim the Father, set apart by the Spirit unto obedience and
sprinkling of the blood of יהושע Messiah: Favour
and peace be increased to you.
1Pet
1:3  Blessed be the Elohim and Father of
our Master יהושע Messiah, who according to His
great compassion has caused us to be born again to a living expectation through
the resurrection of יהושע Messiah from the dead, 
1Pet
1:4  to an inheritance incorruptible and
undefiled and unfading, having been kept in the heavens for you, 
1Pet
1:5  who are protected by the power of
Elohim through belief, for a deliverance ready to be revealed in the last time,

1Pet
1:6  in which you exult, even though for
a little while, if need be, you have been grieved by manifold trials, 
1Pet
1:7  in order that the proving of your
belief – much more precious than gold that perishes, and proven by fire – might
be found to result in praise and respect and esteem at the revelation of יהושע
Messiah, 
1Pet
1:8  whom having not seen, you love; in
whom you exult with unspeakable and esteemed joy, yet not seeing, but
believing, 
1Pet
1:9  obtaining the goal of your belief: a
deliverance of lives. 
1Pet
1:10  Concerning this deliverance the
prophets have sought out and searched out, prophesying concerning the favour
for you, 
1Pet
1:11  searching to know what, or what
sort of time, the Spirit which was in them was pointing out concerning Messiah,
when it was bearing witness beforehand the sufferings of Messiah, and the
esteems that would follow, 
1Pet
1:12  to whom it was revealed that they
were serving, not themselves, but you, in these matters which now have been announced to you through those who
brought the Good News to you by the Set-apart Spirit sent from heaven – into
which messengers long to look into. 
1Pet
1:13  Therefore, having girded up the
loins of your mind, being sober, set your expectation perfectly upon the favour
that is to be brought to you at the revelation of יהושע
Messiah, 
1Pet
1:14  as obedient children, not
conforming yourselves to the former lusts in your ignorance, 
1Pet
1:15  instead, as the One who called you
is set-apart, so you also should become set-apart in all behaviour, 
1Pet
1:16  because it has been written, “Be
set-apart, for I am set-apart.”
1Pet
1:17  And if you call on the Father, who
without partiality judges according to each one’s work, pass the time of your
sojourning in fear, 
1Pet
1:18  knowing that you were redeemed from
your futile way of life inherited from your fathers, not with what is
corruptible, silver or gold, 
1Pet
1:19  but with the precious blood of
Messiah, as of a lamb unblemished and spotless, 
1Pet
1:20  foreknown, indeed, before the
foundation of the world, but manifested in these last times for your sakes, 
1Pet
1:21  who through Him believe in Elohim
who raised Him from the dead and gave Him esteem, so that your belief and
expectation are in Elohim. 
1Pet
1:22  Now that you have cleansed your
lives in obeying the truth through the Spirit to unfeigned brotherly love, love
one another fervently with a clean heart, 
1Pet
1:23  having been born again – not of
corruptible seed, but incorruptible – through the living Word of Elohim, which
remains forever, 
1Pet
1:24  because “All flesh is as grass, and
all the esteem of man as the flower of the grass. The grass withers, and its
flower falls away,
1Pet
1:25  but the Word of Elohim remains
forever.” And this is the Word, announced as Good News to you.
1Pet
2:1  Having put aside, then, all evil,
and all deceit, and hypocrisies, and envyings, and all evil words, 
1Pet
2:2  as newborn babes, desire the
unadulterated milk of the Word, in order that you grow by it, 
1Pet
2:3  if indeed you have tasted that the
Master is good. 
1Pet
2:4  Drawing near to Him, a living Stone –
rejected indeed by men, but chosen by Elohim and precious – 
1Pet
2:5  you also, as living stones, are
being built up, a spiritual house, a set-apart priesthood, to offer up
spiritual slaughter offerings acceptable
to Elohim through יהושע Messiah.
1Pet
2:6  Because it is contained in the
Scripture, “See, I lay in Tsiyon a chief corner-stone, chosen, precious, and he
who believes on Him shall by no means be put to shame.”
1Pet
2:7  This preciousness, then, is for you
who believe; but to those who are disobedient, “The stone which the builders
rejected has become the chief corner-stone,”
1Pet
2:8  and “A stone of stumbling and a rock
that makes for falling,” who stumble because they are disobedient to the Word,
to which they also were appointed.
1Pet
2:9  But you are a chosen race, a royal
priesthood, a set-apart nation, a people for a possession, that you should
proclaim the praises of Him who called you out of darkness into His marvellous
light, 
1Pet
2:10  who once were not a people, but now
the people of Elohim; who had not obtained compassion, but now obtained
compassion.
1Pet
2:11  Beloved ones, I appeal to you as
sojourners and pilgrims, to abstain from fleshly lusts which battle against the
life, 
1Pet
2:12  having your behaviour among the
gentiles good so that when they speak against you as evil-doers, let them, by
observing your good works, esteem Elohim in a day of visitation.
1Pet
2:13  Be subject to every institution of
man because of the Master, whether to the sovereign as supreme, 
1Pet
2:14  or to governors, as to those who
are sent by him for the punishment of doers of evil, and a praise for those who
do good. 
1Pet
2:15  Because such is the desire of
Elohim, that by doing good you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish
men, 
1Pet
2:16  as free, yet not using your freedom
as a cloak for evil, but as servants of Elohim. 
1Pet
2:17  Respect all, love the brotherhood,
fear Elohim, respect the sovereign. 
1Pet
2:18  Servants, be subject to your
masters with all fear, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the crooked
ones. 
1Pet
2:19  For this is favour, if because of
conscience toward Elohim anyone bears up under grief, suffering unrighteously. 
1Pet
2:20  For what credit is there in enduring
a beating when you sin? But if you suffer for doing good and you endure, this finds favour with Elohim. 
1Pet
2:21  For to this you were called,
because Messiah also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that you should
follow His steps,
1Pet
2:22  “who committed no sin, nor was
deceit found in His mouth,”
1Pet
2:23  who, being reviled, did not revile
in return; suffering, did not threaten, but committed Himself to Him who judges righteously; 
1Pet
2:24  who Himself bore our sins in His
body on the timber, so that we, having died to sins, might live unto
righteousness – by whose stripes you were healed.
1Pet
2:25  For you were like sheep going
astray, but have now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your lives. 
1Pet
3:1  In the same way, wives, be subject
to your own husbands, so that if any are disobedient to the Word, they, without
a word, might be won by the behaviour of their wives, 
1Pet
3:2  having seen your blameless behaviour
in fear. 
1Pet
3:3  Your adornment should not be outward
– arranging the hair, wearing gold, or putting on dresses – 
1Pet
3:4  but the hidden Man of the heart,
with the incorruptible ornament of a meek and peaceable spirit, which is of
great value before Elohim. 
1Pet
3:5  For in this way, in former times,
the set-apart women who trusted in Elohim also adorned themselves, being
subject to their own husbands, 
1Pet
3:6  as Sarah obeyed Aḇraham,
calling him master, of whom you became children, doing good, and not frightened
by any fear. 
1Pet
3:7  In the same way, husbands, live
understandingly together, giving respect to the wife, as to the weaker vessel,
and as being heirs together of the favour of life, so that your prayers are not
hindered. 
1Pet
3:8  To sum up, let all of you be like-minded,
sympathetic, loving as brothers, tenderhearted, humble-minded, 
1Pet
3:9  not returning evil for evil or
reviling for reviling, but on the contrary blessing, knowing that you were
called to this, in order to inherit a blessing. 
1Pet
3:10  For “He who wishes to love life and
see good days, let him keep his tongue from evil, and his lips from speaking
deceit, 
1Pet
3:11  let him turn away from evil and do
good, let him seek peace and pursue it. 
1Pet
3:12  “Because the eyes of יהוה
are on the righteous, and his ears are open to their prayers, but the face of יהוה
is against those who do evil.”
1Pet
3:13  And who is the one doing evil to
you, if you become imitators of the good? 
1Pet
3:14  But even if you suffer for
righteousness’ sake, you are blessed. “And do not fear their threats, neither
be troubled.”
1Pet
3:15  But set apart יהוה
Elohim in your hearts, and always be ready to give an answer to everyone asking
you a reason concerning the expectation that is in you, with meekness and fear,

1Pet
3:16  having a good conscience, so that
when they speak against you as doers of evil, those who falsely accuse your
good behaviour in Messiah, shall be ashamed. 
1Pet
3:17  For it is better, if it is the
desire of Elohim, to suffer for doing good than for doing evil. 
1Pet
3:18  Because even Messiah once suffered
for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring you to Elohim, having
been put to death indeed in flesh but made alive in the Spirit,
1Pet
3:19  in which also He went and
proclaimed unto the spirits in prison, 
1Pet
3:20  who were disobedient at one time
when the patience of Elohim waited in the days of Noaḥ, while the ark was
being prepared, in which a few, that is, eight beings, were saved through
water, 
1Pet
3:21  which figure now also saves us:
immersion – not a putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a
good conscience toward Elohim – through the resurrection of יהושע
Messiah, 
1Pet
3:22  who, having gone into heaven, is at
the right hand of Elohim, messengers and authorities and powers having been
subjected to Him. 
1Pet
4:1  Therefore, since Messiah suffered in
the flesh, arm yourselves also with the same mind, because he who has suffered
in the flesh has ceased from sin,
1Pet
4:2  so that he no longer lives the rest of
his time in the flesh for the lusts of men, but according to the desire of
Elohim. 
1Pet
4:3  For we have spent enough of our past lifetime in doing the desire of the
gentiles, having walked in indecencies, lusts, drunkenness, orgies, wild
parties, and abominable idolatries, 
1Pet
4:4  in which they are surprised that you
do not run with them in the same flood of loose behaviour, blaspheming, 
1Pet
4:5  who shall give an account to Him who
is ready to judge the living and the dead. 
1Pet
4:6  For this reason the Good News was
also brought to those who are dead, so that, whereas they are judged according
to men in the flesh, they might live according to Elohim in the spirit. 
1Pet
4:7  But the end of all has drawn near.
Therefore be sober-minded, and be attentive in the prayers. 
1Pet
4:8  And above all have fervent love for
one another, because love covers a great number of sins.
1Pet
4:9  Welcome one another without
grumbling.
1Pet
4:10  As each one has received a gift,
serve one another, as good trustees of the manifold favour of Elohim. 
1Pet
4:11  If anyone speaks, let it be as the Words of Elohim. If
anyone serves, let it be as with the
strength which Elohim provides, so that Elohim might be praised in it all
through יהושע Messiah, to whom belong the esteem
and the rule forever and ever. Amĕn. 
1Pet
4:12  Beloved ones, do not be surprised
at the fiery trial that is coming upon you, to try you, as though some unusual
matter has befallen you, 
1Pet
4:13  but as you share Messiah’s
sufferings, rejoice, in order that you might rejoice exultingly at the
revelation of His esteem.
1Pet
4:14  If you are reproached for the Name
of Messiah, you are blessed, because
the Spirit of esteem and of Elohim rests upon you. On their part He is blasphemed,
but on your part He is praised. 
1Pet
4:15  For do not let any of you suffer as
a murderer, or thief, or doer of evil, or as a meddler. 
1Pet
4:16  But if one suffers being Messianic, let him not be ashamed, but let him
esteem Elohim in this matter. 
1Pet
4:17  Because it is time for judgment to
begin from the House of Elohim. And if firstly from us, what is the end of
those who do not obey the Good News of Elohim? 
1Pet
4:18  And if the righteous one is
scarcely saved, where shall the wicked and the sinner appear?
1Pet
4:19  So then, those who suffer according
to the desire of Elohim should commit their lives to a trustworthy Creator, in
doing good. 
1Pet
5:1  Therefore, as a fellow elder and a
witness of the sufferings of Messiah, and also a sharer of the esteem that is
to be revealed, I appeal to the elders among you: 
1Pet
5:2  Shepherd the flock of Elohim which
is among you, serving as overseers, not by compulsion but voluntarily, not out
of greed for filthy gain, but eagerly, 
1Pet
5:3  neither as being masters over those
entrusted to you, but being examples to the flock.
1Pet
5:4  And when the Chief Shepherd appears,
you shall receive the never-fading crown of esteem.
1Pet
5:5  In the same way, you younger ones,
be subject to elders. And gird yourselves with humility toward one another, for
“Elohim resists the proud, but gives favour to the humble.”
1Pet
5:6  Humble yourselves, then, under the
mighty hand of Elohim, so that He exalts you in due time, 
1Pet
5:7  casting all your worry upon Him, for
He is concerned about you. 
1Pet
5:8  Be sober, watch, because your
adversary the devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.

1Pet
5:9  Resist him, firm in the belief,
knowing that the same hardships are experienced by your brotherhood in the
world. 
1Pet
5:10  And the Elohim of all favour, who
called you to His everlasting esteem by Messiah יהושע,
after you have suffered a while, Himself perfect, establish, strengthen, and
settle you. 
1Pet
5:11  To Him be the esteem and the might
forever and ever. Amĕn. 
1Pet
5:12  Through Sila the trustworthy
brother, as I reckon, I have written to you briefly, encouraging and witnessing
that this is the true favour of Elohim. In this stand fast. 
1Pet
5:13  She who is in Baḇel, chosen
together with you, greets you, also my son, Mark. 
1Pet
5:14  Greet one another with a kiss of
love. Peace to all of you who are in Messiah יהושע.
Amĕn.
