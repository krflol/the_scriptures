Marqos/Mark
Mar
1:1  The beginning of the Good News of יהושע
Messiah, the Son of Elohim. 
Mar
1:2  As it has been written in the
Prophets, “See, I send My messenger before Your face, who shall prepare Your
way before You,
Mar
1:3  a voice of one crying in the
wilderness, ‘Prepare the way of יהוה, make His paths
straight.’ ”
Mar
1:4  Yoḥanan came immersing in the
wilderness and proclaiming an immersion of repentance for the forgiveness of
sins. 
Mar
1:5  And all the country of Yehuḏah,
and those of Yerushalayim, went out to him and were all immersed by him in the
Yardĕn River, confessing their sins. 
Mar
1:6  And Yoḥanan was clothed with
camel’s hair and a leather girdle around his waist, and eating locusts and wild
honey. 
Mar
1:7  And he proclaimed, saying, “After me
comes One who is mightier than I, whose sandal strap I am not worthy to stoop
down and loosen. 
Mar
1:8  “I indeed did immerse you in water,
but He shall immerse you in the Set-apart Spirit.” 
Mar
1:9  And it came to be in those days that
יהושע came from Natsareth of Galil, and was
immersed by Yoḥanan in the Yardĕn. 
Mar
1:10  And immediately, coming up from the
water, He saw the heavens being torn open and the Spirit coming down on Him
like a dove. 
Mar
1:11  And a voice came out of the
heavens, “You are My Son, the Beloved, in whom I did delight.” 
Mar
1:12  And immediately the Spirit drove
Him into the wilderness. 
Mar
1:13  And He was there in the wilderness
forty days, tried by Satan, and was with the wild beasts. And the messengers
attended Him. 
Mar
1:14  And after Yoḥanan was
delivered up, יהושע came to Galil, proclaiming
the Good News of the reign of Elohim, 
Mar
1:15  and saying, “The time has been
filled, and the reign of Elohim has come near. Repent, and believe in the Good
News.” 
Mar
1:16  And walking by the Sea of Galil, He
saw Shim‛on, and Andri his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they
were fishers. 
Mar
1:17  And יהושע
said to them, “Come, follow Me, and I shall make you become fishers of men.” 
Mar
1:18  And immediately they left their
nets and followed Him. 
Mar
1:19  And having gone on a little from
there, He saw Ya‛aqoḇ the son
of Zaḇdai, and Yoḥanan his brother, and they were in the boat
mending their nets. 
Mar
1:20  And immediately He called them, and
leaving their father Zaḇdai in the boat with the hired servants, they
went after Him. 
Mar
1:21  And they went into Kephar
Naḥum, and immediately on the Sabbath He went into the congregation and
taught. 
Mar
1:22  And they were astonished at His
teaching, for He was teaching them as possessing authority, and not as the
scribes. 
Mar
1:23  And there was a man in their
congregation with an unclean spirit, and he cried out, 
Mar
1:24  saying, “Ha! What have we to do
with You, יהושע of Natsareth? Did You come to
destroy us? I know who You are: the Set-apart One of Elohim!” 
Mar
1:25  And יהושע
rebuked him, saying, “Be silenced, and come out of him!” 
Mar
1:26  And throwing him into convulsions,
the unclean spirit called out with a loud voice, and came out of him. 
Mar
1:27  And they were all so amazed, as to
reason among themselves, saying, “What is this, a fresh teaching? With
authority He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey Him!” 
Mar
1:28  And news about Him immediately
spread into all the country around Galil. 
Mar
1:29  And coming out of the congregation,
they went straight to the house of Shim‛on and Andri, with Ya‛aqoḇ
and Yoḥanan. 
Mar
1:30  And the mother-in-law of Shim‛on
lay sick with inflammation, and immediately they spoke to Him about her. 
Mar
1:31  And having come, He took her by the
hand and lifted her up, and immediately the inflammation left her, and she
served them. 
Mar
1:32  And when evening came, when the sun
had set, they brought to Him all who were sick and those who were
demon-possessed. 
Mar
1:33  And the entire city had gathered at
the door. 
Mar
1:34  And He healed many who were sick
with various diseases, and cast out many demons, and was not allowing the
demons to speak, because they knew Him. 
Mar
1:35  And having risen very early in the
morning, while still dark, He went out, and went away to a lonely place, and
there He prayed. 
Mar
1:36  And Shim‛on and those who
were with Him searched for Him, 
Mar
1:37  and when they found Him, they said
to Him, “All are seeking You.” 
Mar
1:38  And He said to them, “Let us go
into the neighbouring towns, so that I proclaim there also, because for this I
have come forth.” 
Mar
1:39  And He was proclaiming in their
congregations, in all Galil, and casting out demons. 
Mar
1:40  And a leper came to Him, calling
upon Him, kneeling down to Him and saying to Him, “If You desire, You are able
to make me clean.” 
Mar
1:41  And יהושע,
moved with compassion, stretched out His hand and touched him, and said to him,
“I desire it. Be cleansed.” 
Mar
1:42  And immediately the leprosy left
him, and he was cleansed. 
Mar
1:43  And having strictly warned him, He
immediately sent him away, 
Mar
1:44  and said to him, “See, say none at
all to anyone, but go show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing
what Mosheh ordered, as a witness to them.” 
Mar
1:45  But he went out and began to
publish it so much, and to spread the word, that יהושע
was no longer able to openly enter the city, but was outside in lonely places.
Yet they came to Him from all directions. 
Mar
2:1  And some days later He again entered
into Kephar Naḥum, and it was heard that He was in the house. 
Mar
2:2  And so many gathered together, that
there was no more room, not even at the door. And He spoke the Word to them. 
Mar
2:3  And they came to Him, bringing a
paralytic, carried by four. 
Mar
2:4  And not being able to come near Him
because of the crowd, they uncovered the roof where He was. And when they had
broken through, they let down the bed on which the paralytic was lying. 
Mar
2:5  And when יהושע
saw their belief, He said to the paralytic, “Son, your sins are forgiven you.” 
Mar
2:6  Now some of the scribes were sitting
there, and reasoning in their hearts, 
Mar
2:7  “Why does this One talk like this?
He is blaspheming! Who is able to forgive sins but Elohim alone?” 
Mar
2:8  And immediately יהושע,
knowing in His spirit that they were reasoning that way within themselves, said
to them, “Why do you reason about all this in your hearts? 
Mar
2:9  “Which is easier, to say to the
paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Rise, take up your bed and walk’?

Mar
2:10  “But in order for you to know that
the Son of Aḏam possesses authority on earth to forgive sins...” He said
to the paralytic, 
Mar
2:11  “I say to you, rise, take up your
bed, and go to your house.” 
Mar
2:12  And he rose straightaway, and took
up the bed, and went out before all, so that all were amazed and praised
Elohim, saying, “We have never seen the like of it!” 
Mar
2:13  And He went out again by the sea,
and all the crowd was coming to Him, and He taught them. 
Mar
2:14  And passing by, He saw Lĕwi
the son of Alphai sitting at the tax
office, and said to him, “Follow Me.” And having risen he followed Him. 
Mar
2:15  And it came to be, as He sat at the
table at his house, that many tax collectors and sinners also sat with יהושע
and His taught ones, for there were many, and they followed Him. 
Mar
2:16  And when the scribes and Pharisees
saw Him eating with the tax collectors and sinners, they said to His taught
ones, “Why does He eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?” 
Mar
2:17  And hearing this, יהושע
said to them, “Those who are strong have no need of a physician, but those who
are sick. I did not come to call the righteous to repentance, but sinners.” 
Mar
2:18  And the taught ones of
Yoḥanan and of the Pharisees were fasting. And they came and said to Him,
“Why do the taught ones of Yoḥanan and of the Pharisees fast, but Your
taught ones do not fast?” 
Mar
2:19  And יהושע
said to them, “Are the friends of the bridegroom able to fast while the
bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them they are
not able to fast. 
Mar
2:20  “But the days shall come when the
bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then they shall fast in those
days. 
Mar
2:21  “And no one sews a piece of unshrunk
cloth on an old garment, otherwise the renewed piece pulls away from the old,
and the tear is made worse. 
Mar
2:22  “And no one puts new wine into old
wineskins, otherwise the new wine bursts the wineskins, and the wine runs out,
and the wineskins are ruined. But new wine is to be put into fresh wineskins.” 
Mar
2:23  And it came to be that He went
through the grainfields on the Sabbath. And as they went His taught ones began
to pluck heads of grain, 
Mar
2:24  and the Pharisees said to Him, “Look,
why do they do what is not right on the Sabbath?” 
Mar
2:25  And He said to them, “Have you
never read what Dawiḏ did when he had need and was hungry, he and those
with him? 
Mar
2:26  “How he went into the House of
Elohim, while Eḇyathar was high priest, and ate the showbread, which is
not right to eat, except for the priests, and he gave it also to those who were
with him?” 
Mar
2:27  And He said to them, “The Sabbath
was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath. 
Mar
2:28  “So the Son of Aḏam is also Master
of the Sabbath.”
Mar
3:1  And He went into the congregation
again, and a man who had a withered hand was there. 
Mar
3:2  And they were watching Him, whether
He would heal him on the Sabbath, so as to accuse Him. 
Mar
3:3  And He said to the man who had the
withered hand, “Get up to the middle.” 
Mar
3:4  And He said to them, “Is it right to
do good on the Sabbath, or to do evil, to save life or to kill?” But they
remained silent. 
Mar
3:5  And having looked around on them
with displeasure, being grieved at the hardness of their hearts, He said to the
man, “Stretch out your hand.” And he stretched it out, and his hand was
restored as healthy as the other. 
Mar
3:6  And the Pharisees went out and
immediately plotted with the Herodians against Him, how to destroy Him. 
Mar
3:7  But יהושע
withdrew with His taught ones to the sea. And a great crowd from Galil followed
Him, and from Yehuḏah. 
Mar
3:8  Even from Yerushalayim, and from Eḏom
and beyond the Yardĕn, and those around Tsor and Tsiḏon, a large
crowd came to Him when they heard how much He was doing. 
Mar
3:9  And He spoke to His taught ones,
that a small boat should be kept ready for Him because of the crowd, lest they
should press upon Him. 
Mar
3:10  For He healed many, so that as many
as had afflictions fell upon Him to touch Him. 
Mar
3:11  And the unclean spirits, whenever
they saw Him, fell down before Him and cried out, saying, “You are the Son of
Elohim.” 
Mar
3:12  But He warned them many times that
they should not make Him known. 
Mar
3:13  And He went up on the mountain and
called to Him whom He wished, and they came to Him. 
Mar
3:14  And He appointed twelve to be with
Him, and to be sent out to proclaim, 
Mar
3:15  and to possess authority to heal
sicknesses and to cast out demons. 
Mar
3:16  And He appointed the twelve: Shim‛on,
to whom He added the name Kĕpha; 
Mar
3:17  and Ya‛aqoḇ the son of Zaḇdai, and Yoḥanan
the brother of Ya‛aqoḇ, to whom He added the name Beni-Reḡes,
that is, “Sons of Thunder,” 
Mar
3:18  and Andri, and Philip, and
Bartholomi, and Mattithyahu, and T’oma, and Ya‛aqoḇ son of Alphai, and Taddai, and Shim‛on
the Kena‛anite; 
Mar
3:19  and Yehuḏah from Qerioth, who
did also deliver Him up. And they went into a house, 
Mar
3:20  and again the crowd came together,
so that they were unable even to eat bread. 
Mar
3:21  And when His relatives heard about
this, they went out to seize Him, for they said, “He is out of His mind.” 
Mar
3:22  And the scribes who came down from
Yerushalayim said, “He has Be‛elzebul,” and, “He casts out demons by the
ruler of the demons.” 
Mar
3:23  And calling them near He said to
them in parables, “How is Satan able to cast out Satan? 
Mar
3:24  “And if a reign is divided against
itself, that reign is unable to stand. 
Mar
3:25  “And if a house is divided against
itself, that house is unable to stand. 
Mar
3:26  “And if Satan has risen up against
himself, and is divided, he is unable to stand, but has an end. 
Mar
3:27  “No one is able to enter a strong
man’s house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man, and
then he shall plunder his house. 
Mar
3:28  “Truly, I say to you, all the sins
shall be forgiven the sons of men, and whatever blasphemies they speak, 
Mar
3:29  but he who blasphemes against the
Set-apart Spirit has no forgiveness forever, but is subject to everlasting
judgment,” 
Mar
3:30  because they said, “He has an
unclean spirit.” 
Mar
3:31  And His brothers and His mother
came, and standing outside they sent to Him, calling Him. 
Mar
3:32  And a crowd was sitting around Him.
And they said to Him, “See, Your mother and Your brothers are outside seeking
You.” 
Mar
3:33  But He answered them, saying, “Who
is My mother, or My brothers?” 
Mar
3:34  And looking about on those sitting
round Him, He said, “See My mother and My brothers! 
Mar
3:35  “For whoever does the desire of
Elohim is My brother and My sister and mother.”
Mar
4:1  And He began to teach again by the
sea, and a large crowd was gathered to Him, so that He entered into a boat, to
sit in the sea. And all the crowd was on the land facing the sea. 
Mar
4:2  And He taught them much in parables,
and said to them in His teaching: 
Mar
4:3  “Listen! See, a sower went out to
sow.
Mar
4:4  “And it came to be, as he sowed,
some fell by the wayside, and the birds of the heaven came and devoured it. 
Mar
4:5  “And other fell on rocky places,
where it had not much soil. And immediately it sprang up because it had no
depth of soil. 
Mar
4:6  “But when the sun was up it was
scorched, and because it had no root it withered away. 
Mar
4:7  “And other fell among thorns. And
the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no crop. 
Mar
4:8  “And other fell on good soil and
yielded a crop that came up, grew and yielded a crop, some thirtyfold, and some
sixty, and some a hundred.” 
Mar
4:9  And He said to them, “He who has
ears to hear, let him hear!” 
Mar
4:10  And when He was alone, those about
Him, with the twelve, asked Him about the parable. 
Mar
4:11  And He said to them, “To you it has
been given to know the secret of the reign of Elohim, but to those who are
outside, all are done in parables, 
Mar
4:12  so that ‘seeing they see but do not
perceive, and hearing they hear but do not understand, lest they should turn
and their sins be forgiven them.’ ”
Mar
4:13  And He said to them, “Do you not
understand this parable? How then shall you understand all the parables? 
Mar
4:14  “The sower sows the word. 
Mar
4:15  “These, then, are the ones by the
wayside where the word is sown. And when they hear, Satan comes immediately and
takes away the word that was sown in their hearts. 
Mar
4:16  “And likewise these are the ones
sown on rocky places, who, when they hear the word, immediately receive it with
joy, 
Mar
4:17  and they have no root in
themselves, but are short-lived. Then when pressure or persecution arises
because of the word, immediately they stumble. 
Mar
4:18  “And others are those sown among
thorns, these are they who hear the word, 
Mar
4:19  and the worries of this age, and
the deceit of riches, and the desires for other matters, entering in, choke the word, and it becomes fruitless. 
Mar
4:20  “And those sown on good soil, are
those who hear the word, and accept it, and bear fruit, some thirtyfold, and
some sixty, and some a hundred.” 
Mar
4:21  And He said to them, “Would a lamp
be brought to be put under a basket or under a bed? Is it not to be put on a
lampstand? 
Mar
4:22  “For whatever is hidden shall be
revealed, and whatever has been kept secret, shall come to light.
Mar
4:23  “If anyone has ears to hear, let
him hear.” 
Mar
4:24  And He said to them, “Take heed
what you hear. With the same measure you use, it shall be measured to you, and
more shall be added to you who hear. 
Mar
4:25  “For whoever possesses, to him more
shall be given; but whoever does not possess, even what he possesses shall be
taken away from him.”
Mar
4:26  And He said, “The reign of Elohim
is as when a man scatters seed on the ground, 
Mar
4:27  then sleeps by night and rises by
day, while the seed sprouts and grows, he himself does not know how. 
Mar
4:28  “For the soil yields crops by
itself: first the blade, then the head, after that the completed grain in the
head. 
Mar
4:29  “And when the crop is ready,
immediately he puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come.” 
Mar
4:30  And He said, “To what shall we
compare the reign of Elohim? Or with what parable shall we present it? 
Mar
4:31  “Like a mustard seed, which, when
it is sown on the ground, is smaller than all the seeds on earth, 
Mar
4:32  and when it is sown, it grows up
and becomes greater than all plants, and forms large branches, so that the
birds of the heaven are able to nest under its shade.” 
Mar
4:33  And with many such parables He was
speaking to them the word as they were able to hear, 
Mar
4:34  and He was not speaking to them
without parables. And when they were alone, He explained all to His taught
ones. 
Mar
4:35  And on the same day, when evening
had come, He said to them, “Let us pass over to the other side.” 
Mar
4:36  And having left the crowd, they
took Him along in the boat, as He was. And other little boats were also with
Him. 
Mar
4:37  And there came a great windstorm,
and the waves beat into the boat, so that it was already being filled. 
Mar
4:38  And He was in the stern, asleep on
a cushion. And they woke Him up and said to Him, “Teacher, is it no concern to
You that we perish?” 
Mar
4:39  And having been awakened He rebuked
the wind, and said to the sea, “Peace, be still!” And the wind ceased and there
was a great calm. 
Mar
4:40  And He said to them, “Why are you
so afraid? Have you not yet belief?” 
Mar
4:41  And they feared exceedingly, and
asked each other, “Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey Him!” 
Mar
5:1  And they came to the other side of
the sea, to the country of the Gaḏarenes. 
Mar
5:2  And when He came out of the boat,
immediately there met Him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit, 
Mar
5:3  who had his dwelling among the
tombs. And no one was able to bind him, not even with chains, 
Mar
5:4  because he had often been bound with
shackles and chains but the chains had been pulled apart by him, and the
shackles broken in pieces, and no one was able to tame him. 
Mar
5:5  And continually, night and day, he
was in the mountains and in the tombs, crying out and cutting himself with
stones. 
Mar
5:6  And seeing יהושע
from a distance, he ran and bowed down to Him, 
Mar
5:7  and having called out with a loud
voice, said, “What have I to do with You, יהושע,
Son of the Most High Ĕl? Swear to Elohim not to torture me.” 
Mar
5:8  For He had said to him, “Come out of
the man, unclean spirit!” 
Mar
5:9  And He was asking him, “What is your
name?” And he answered, saying, “My name is Legion, because we are many.” 
Mar
5:10  And he begged Him very much that He
would not send them out of the country. 
Mar
5:11  Now a great herd of pigs was there,
feeding near the mountains. 
Mar
5:12  And all the demons begged Him,
saying, “Send us to the pigs, so that we enter into them.” 
Mar
5:13  And He gave them permission. And
the unclean spirits came out and entered into the pigs – they were about two
thousand – and the herd rushed down the steep place into the sea, and drowned
in the sea. 
Mar
5:14  And those who fed the pigs fled,
and reported it in the city and in the country. And they went out to see what
had taken place. 
Mar
5:15  So they came to יהושע,
and saw the demon-possessed one, him who had the legion, sitting, and dressed,
and in his right mind. And they were afraid. 
Mar
5:16  And those who saw it related to
them what was done to the demon-possessed one, and about the pigs. 
Mar
5:17  And they began to plead with Him to
leave their borders. 
Mar
5:18  And as He was entering into the
boat, he who had been demon-possessed begged Him that he might be with Him. 
Mar
5:19  And יהושע
did not allow him, but said to him, “Go home to your friends, and report to
them what the Master has done for you, and how He had compassion on you.” 
Mar
5:20  And he left and began to proclaim
in Dekapolis all that יהושע had done for him, and
all marvelled. 
Mar
5:21  And when יהושע
had passed over again by boat to the other side, a large crowd assembled to
Him, and He was by the sea. 
Mar
5:22  And see, one of the rulers of the
congregation came, Ya’ir by name. And when he saw Him, he fell at His feet, 
Mar
5:23  and begged Him strongly, saying, “My
little daughter lies at the point of death. Come, lay Your hands on her to heal
her, and she shall live.” 
Mar
5:24  And He went with him. And a large
crowd was following Him, and they were thronging Him. 
Mar
5:25  And a certain woman had a flow of
blood for twelve years, 
Mar
5:26  and had suffered much from many
physicians, and spent all that she had and was no better, but rather became
worse. 
Mar
5:27  Having heard about יהושע,
she came behind Him in the crowd and touched His garment, 
Mar
5:28  for she said, “If I only touch His
garments, I shall be made well.” 
Mar
5:29  And immediately the fountain of her
blood was dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of the
affliction. 
Mar
5:30  And immediately יהושע,
knowing in Himself that power had gone out of Him, turned around in the crowd
and said, “Who touched My garments?” 
Mar
5:31  And His taught ones said to Him, “You
see the crowd is thronging You, and You say, ‘Who touched Me?’ ” 
Mar
5:32  And He was looking around to see
her who did this. 
Mar
5:33  And the woman, fearing and
trembling, knowing what was done to her, came and fell down before Him and
spoke to Him all the truth. 
Mar
5:34  And He said to her, “Daughter, your
belief has healed you. Go in peace, and be relieved from your affliction.” 
Mar
5:35  As He was speaking, they came from
the ruler of the congregation’s house,
saying to him, “Your daughter is
dead. Why trouble the Teacher any further?” 
Mar
5:36  But having heard the word that was
spoken, יהושע said to the ruler of the
congregation, “Do not be afraid – only believe.” 
Mar
5:37  And He allowed no one to follow Him
except Kĕpha, and Ya‛aqoḇ, and Yoḥanan the brother of Ya‛aqoḇ.

Mar
5:38  So they came to the house of the
ruler of the congregation, and saw a commotion, and much weeping and lamenting.

Mar
5:39  And coming in He said to them, “Why
make this commotion and weep? The child has not died, but is sleeping.” 
Mar
5:40  And they were laughing at Him. And
when He had put them all out, He took the father and the mother of the child,
and those who were with Him, and went in where the child was lying. 
Mar
5:41  And taking the child by the hand He
said to her, “Talitha, qumi,” which is translated, “Little girl, I say to you,
arise.” 
Mar
5:42  And immediately the girl rose up
and was walking, for she was twelve years old. And they were completely
astonished. 
Mar
5:43  But He ordered them many times that
no one should know it, and said that she should be given food to eat. 
Mar
6:1  And He went away from there and came
to His own country, and His taught ones followed Him. 
Mar
6:2  And Sabbath having come, He began to
teach in the congregation. And many who heard Him were astonished, saying, “Where did He get all this? And what
wisdom is this which is given to Him, that such miracles are done through His
hands? 
Mar
6:3  “Is this not the carpenter, the Son
of Miryam, and brother of Ya‛aqoḇ, and Yosĕph, and Yehuḏah,
and Shim‛on? And are not His sisters here with us?” And they stumbled in
Him. 
Mar
6:4  And יהושע
said to them, “A prophet is not unappreciated except in his own country, and
among his own relatives, and in his own house.” 
Mar
6:5  And He was unable to do any miracle
there, except that He laid His hands on a few sick ones and healed them. 
Mar
6:6  And He marvelled because of their
unbelief. And He was going around among the villages, teaching. 
Mar
6:7  And He called the twelve near, and
began to send them out two by two, and gave them authority over unclean
spirits. 
Mar
6:8  And He instructed them to take none
at all for the journey except a staff – no bag, no bread, no copper in their
money belts, 
Mar
6:9  but to wear sandals, and not to wear
two undergarments. 
Mar
6:10  And He said to them, “Wherever you
enter into a house, stay there until you leave that place. 
Mar
6:11  “And any place that does not
receive you or listen to you, when you leave there, shake off the dust under
your feet as a witness against them. Truly, I say to you, it shall be more
bearable for Seḏom and Amorah in the day of judgment than for that city!”

Mar
6:12  And they went out and proclaimed
that men should repent. 
Mar
6:13  And they were casting out many
demons, and they were anointing with oil many who were sick, and they were
healing them. 
Mar
6:14  And Sovereign Herodes heard, for
His Name had become well-known. And he said, “Yoḥanan the Immerser has
been raised from the dead, and because of this these powers are at work in him.”

Mar
6:15  Others said, “He is Ĕliyahu.”
And others said, “He is a prophet – like one of the prophets.” 
Mar
6:16  But when Herodes heard, he said, “This
one is Yoḥanan whom I beheaded, he has been raised from the dead!” 
Mar
6:17  For Herodes himself had sent and
seized Yoḥanan, and bound him in prison because of Herodias, his brother
Philip’s wife, because he had married her, 
Mar
6:18  for Yoḥanan had said to
Herodes, “It is not right for you to have your brother’s wife.” 
Mar
6:19  So Herodias held a grudge against
him and wished to kill him, but was unable, 
Mar
6:20  for Herodes feared Yoḥanan,
knowing that he was a righteous and set-apart man, and he protected him. And
when he heard him, he was much perplexed, yet heard him gladly. 
Mar
6:21  And a suitable day came when
Herodes on his birthday gave a feast for his great men, and the high officers,
and the chief men of Galil. 
Mar
6:22  And when the daughter of Herodias
herself came in and danced, and pleased Herodes and those who sat with him, the
sovereign said to the girl, “Ask me whatever you wish, and I shall give it to
you.” 
Mar
6:23  And he swore to her, “Whatever you
ask me, I shall give you, up to half of my reign.” 
Mar
6:24  And she went out and said to her
mother, “What shall I ask?” And she said, “The head of Yoḥanan the
Immerser!” 
Mar
6:25  And coming in immediately with
haste to the sovereign she asked, saying, “I wish that you give me at once the
head of Yoḥanan the Immerser on a dish.” 
Mar
6:26  And the sovereign, becoming deeply
grieved, because of the oaths, and because of those who sat with him, did not
wish to refuse her. 
Mar
6:27  And the sovereign straightaway sent
an executioner and commanded his head to be brought. And he went and beheaded
him in prison, 
Mar
6:28  and brought his head on a dish, and
gave it to the girl. And the girl gave it to her mother. 
Mar
6:29  And when his taught ones heard of
it, they came and took away his dead body and laid it in a tomb. 
Mar
6:30  And the emissaries gathered to יהושע
and reported to Him all, both what they had done and what they had taught. 
Mar
6:31  And He said to them, “Come aside by
yourselves to a lonely place and rest a little” – for there were many coming
and going, and they did not even have time to eat. 
Mar
6:32  And they went away to a lonely
place in the boat by themselves. 
Mar
6:33  But they saw them going, and many
recognised Him and ran there on foot from all the cities, and came before them
and came together to Him. 
Mar
6:34  And having gone out, יהושע
saw a large crowd and was moved with compassion for them because they were like
sheep not having a shepherd. And He began to teach them many matters. 
Mar
6:35  And as the hour grew late, His
taught ones came to Him and said, “This is a lonely place, and now the hour is
late. 
Mar
6:36  “Send them away, so that they go
into the surrounding country and villages and buy themselves bread, since they
have no food to eat.” 
Mar
6:37  But He answering, said to them, “You
give them to eat.” And they said to Him, “Should we go and buy two hundred
silver pieces worth of bread and give them to eat?” 
Mar
6:38  Then He said to them, “How many
loaves do you have? Go and see.” And when they found out they said, “Five, and
two fishes.” 
Mar
6:39  And He ordered them to make them
all sit down in groups on the green grass. 
Mar
6:40  And they sat down in groups, in
hundreds and in fifties. 
Mar
6:41  And taking the five loaves and the
two fishes, looking up to the heaven, He blessed and broke the loaves, and gave
them to His taught ones to set before them. And the two fishes He divided among
them all. 
Mar
6:42  And all ate and were satisfied. 
Mar
6:43  And they picked up twelve baskets,
filled with pieces, also from the fishes. 
Mar
6:44  Now those who ate the loaves were
about five thousand men. 
Mar
6:45  And immediately He made His taught
ones enter into the boat, and to go before Him to the other side, to Bĕyth
Tsaiḏa, while He was dismissing the crowd. 
Mar
6:46  And having sent them away, He went
away to the mountain to pray. 
Mar
6:47  And when evening came, the boat was
in the middle of the sea. And He was alone on the land. 
Mar
6:48  And seeing them straining at rowing
– for the wind was against them – at about the fourth watch of the night, He
came to them walking on the sea, and He
wished to pass them by. 
Mar
6:49  And when they saw Him walking on
the sea, they thought it was a phantom, and cried out, 
Mar
6:50  for they all saw Him and were
troubled. And immediately He spoke to them and said to them, “Take courage, it
is I. Do not be afraid.” 
Mar
6:51  And He went up to them, into the
boat, and the wind ceased. And they were exceedingly amazed in themselves, and
marvelled. 
Mar
6:52  For they did not understand about
the loaves, because their heart was hardened. 
Mar
6:53  And having passed over, they came
to the land of Gennĕsar and drew to shore. 
Mar
6:54  And when they came out of the boat,
He was immediately recognised, 
Mar
6:55  and all that neighbourhood ran
about, and began to carry about on beds those who were sick to wherever they
heard He was. 
Mar
6:56  And wherever He went, into
villages, or cities, or the country, they were laying the sick in the
market-places, and begged Him to let them touch if only the tzitzit of His
garment. And as many as touched Him were healed.
Mar
7:1  And the Pharisees and some of the
scribes assembled to Him, having come from Yerushalayim. 
Mar
7:2  And seeing some of His taught ones
eat bread with defiled, that is, with unwashed hands, they found fault. 
Mar
7:3  For the Pharisees, and all the Yehuḏim,
do not eat unless they wash their hands thoroughly, holding fast the tradition
of the elders, 
Mar
7:4  and coming from the market-place, they do not eat unless they wash. And
there are many other traditions which
they have received and hold fast – the washing of cups and utensils and copper
vessels and couches. 
Mar
7:5  Then the Pharisees and scribes asked
Him, “Why do Your taught ones not walk according to the tradition of the
elders, but eat bread with unwashed hands?” 
Mar
7:6  And He answering, said to them, “Well
did Yeshayahu prophesy concerning you hypocrites, as it has been written, ‘This
people respect Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me. 
Mar
7:7  And in vain do they worship Me,
teaching as teachings the commands of men.’
Mar
7:8  “Forsaking the command of Elohim,
you hold fast the tradition of men.” 
Mar
7:9  And He said to them, “Well do you
set aside the command of Elohim, in order to guard your tradition. 
Mar
7:10  “For Mosheh said, ‘Respect your
father and your mother,’ and, ‘He who curses father or mother, let him be put
to death.’ 
Mar
7:11  “But you say, ‘If a man says to his
father or mother, “Whatever profit you might have received from me, is Qorban
(that is, a gift),” ’ 
Mar
7:12  you no longer let him do any matter at all for his father or his
mother, 
Mar
7:13  nullifying the Word of Elohim
through your tradition which you have handed down. And many such traditions you do.” 
Mar
7:14  And calling the crowd to Him, He
said to them, “Hear Me, everyone, and understand: 
Mar
7:15  “There is no matter that enters a
man from outside which is able to defile him, but it is what comes out of him
that defiles the man. 
Mar
7:16  “If anyone has ears to hear, let
him hear!” 
Mar
7:17  And when He went from the crowd
into a house, His taught ones asked Him concerning the parable. 
Mar
7:18  And He said to them, “Are you also
without understanding? Do you not perceive that whatever enters a man from outside
is unable to defile him, 
Mar
7:19  because it does not enter his heart
but his stomach, and is eliminated, thus purging all the foods?”
Mar
7:20  And He said, “What comes out of a
man, that defiles a man. 
Mar
7:21  “For from within, out of the heart
of men, proceed evil reasonings, adulteries, whorings, murders, 
Mar
7:22  thefts, greedy desires,
wickednesses, deceit, indecency, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness. 
Mar
7:23  “All these wicked matters come from within and defile a
man.” 
Mar
7:24  And rising up from there He went to
the borders of Tsor and Tsiḏon. And entering into a house He wished no
one to know it, but it was impossible to be hidden. 
Mar
7:25  For a woman whose young daughter
had an unclean spirit heard about Him, and she came and fell at His feet. 
Mar
7:26  Now the woman was a Greek, a
Syro-Phoenician by birth, and she kept asking Him to cast the demon out of her
daughter. 
Mar
7:27  And יהושע
said to her, “Let the children be satisfied first, for it is not good to take
the children’s bread and throw it to the little dogs.”
Mar
7:28  But she answering, said to Him, “Yea,
Master, for even the little dogs under the table eat from the children’s
crumbs.” 
Mar
7:29  And He said to her, “Because of
this word go, the demon has gone out of your daughter.” 
Mar
7:30  And having come into her house, she
found the demon gone out, and her daughter lying on the bed. 
Mar
7:31  And again, going out from the
borders of Tsor and Tsiḏon, He came to the Sea of Galil, through the
midst of the borders of Dekapolis. 
Mar
7:32  And they brought to Him one who was
deaf and spoke with difficulty, and they begged Him to lay His hand upon him. 
Mar
7:33  And taking him away from the crowd,
He put His fingers in his ears, and having spit, He touched his tongue. 
Mar
7:34  And looking up to the heaven, He
sighed, and said to him, “Ephphatha,” that is, “Be opened.” 
Mar
7:35  And immediately his ears were
opened, and the binding of his tongue was loosed, and he was speaking plainly. 
Mar
7:36  And He ordered them, that they
should say it to no one, but the more He ordered them, the more they published
it. 
Mar
7:37  And they were immeasurably
astonished, saying, “He has done all well. He makes even the deaf to hear and
the dumb to speak.” 
Mar
8:1  In those days, the crowd being very
great and not having any to eat, יהושע called His
taught ones near and said to them, 
Mar
8:2  “I have compassion on the crowd, for
they have now been with Me three days and do not have food to eat. 
Mar
8:3  “And if I dismiss them unfed to
their home, they shall faint on the way, for some of them have come from far.” 
Mar
8:4  And His taught ones answered Him, “How
shall anyone be able to feed these people with bread here in the desert?” 
Mar
8:5  And He asked them, “How many loaves
do you have?” And they said, “Seven.” 
Mar
8:6  And He commanded the crowd to sit
down on the ground. And taking the seven loaves, giving thanks, He broke them
and gave them to His taught ones to set before them. And they set them before
the crowd. 
Mar
8:7  And they had a few small fishes. And
having blessed, He said to set them also before them. 
Mar
8:8  And they ate and were satisfied, and
they picked up seven large baskets of broken pieces. 
Mar
8:9  And those eating were about four
thousand, and He dismissed them. 
Mar
8:10  And immediately entering into the
boat with His taught ones, He came to the parts of Dalmanutha. 
Mar
8:11  And the Pharisees came out and
began to dispute with Him, seeking from Him a sign from heaven, trying Him. 
Mar
8:12  And sighing deeply in His spirit He
said, “Why does this generation seek a sign? Truly, I say to you, no sign shall
be given to this generation.” 
Mar
8:13  And leaving them, again entering
into the boat, He went away to the other side. 
Mar
8:14  And they had forgotten to take
bread, and they did not have more than one loaf with them in the boat. 
Mar
8:15  And He was warning them, saying, “Mind!
Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the leaven of Herodes.” 
Mar
8:16  And they were reasoning with one
another, saying, “Because we have no bread.” 
Mar
8:17  And יהושע,
being aware of it, said to them, “Why do you reason because you have no bread?
Do you not yet perceive nor understand? Is your heart still hardened? 
Mar
8:18  “Having eyes, do you not see? And
having ears, do you not hear? And do you not remember? 
Mar
8:19  “When I broke the five loaves for
the five thousand, how many baskets filled with broken pieces did you pick up?”
They said to Him, “Twelve.” 
Mar
8:20  “And when I broke the seven for the
four thousand, how many large baskets filled with broken pieces did you pick
up?” And they said, “Seven.” 
Mar
8:21  And He said to them, “How do you
not understand?” 
Mar
8:22  And He came to Bĕyth Tsaiḏa,
and they brought a blind man to Him, and begged Him to touch him. 
Mar
8:23  And taking the blind man by the
hand He led him out of the village. And having spit on his eyes, laying hands
on him, He asked him, “Do you see at all?” 
Mar
8:24  And he looked up and said, “I see
men like trees, walking.” 
Mar
8:25  Then He placed His hands on his
eyes again and made him look up. And he was restored, and saw all clearly. 
Mar
8:26  And He sent him away to his home,
saying, “Do not go into the village.” 
Mar
8:27  And יהושע
and His taught ones went out to the villages of Caesarea Philippi. And on the
way He asked His taught ones, saying to them, “Who do men say I am?” 
Mar
8:28  And they said to Him, “Yoḥanan
the Immerser, and others, Ĕliyahu, but others, one of the prophets.” 
Mar
8:29  And He asked them, “And you, who do
you say I am?” And Kĕpha answering, said to Him, “You are the Messiah.” 
Mar
8:30  And He warned them that they should
speak to no one about Him. 
Mar
8:31  And He began to teach them that the
Son of Aḏam has to suffer much, and be rejected by the elders and chief
priests and scribes, and be killed, and after three days to rise again. 
Mar
8:32  And He was speaking about this
openly. Then Kĕpha, taking Him aside, began to rebuke Him. 
Mar
8:33  And turning around and seeing His
taught ones, He rebuked Kĕpha, saying, “Get behind Me, Satan! For your
thoughts are not those of Elohim, but those of men.” 
Mar
8:34  And calling near the crowd with His
taught ones, He said to them, “Whoever desires to come after Me, let him deny
himself, and take up his stake, and follow Me. 
Mar
8:35  “For whoever desires to save his
life shall lose it, but whoever loses his life for the sake of Me and the Good
News, he shall save it. 
Mar
8:36  “For what shall it profit a man if
he gains all the world, and loses his own life? 
Mar
8:37  “Or what shall a man give in
exchange for his life? 
Mar
8:38  “For whoever is ashamed of Me and
My words in this adulterous and sinning generation, of him the Son of Aḏam
also shall be ashamed when He comes in the esteem of His Father with the
set-apart messengers.” 
Mar
9:1  And He said to them, “Truly, I say
to you that there are some standing here who shall not taste of death at all
until they see the reign of Elohim having come in power:”
Mar
9:2  And after six days יהושע
took Kĕpha, and Ya‛aqoḇ, and Yoḥanan, and led them up on
a high mountain alone by themselves. And He was transformed before them. 
Mar
9:3  And His garments became glittering,
exceedingly white, like snow, such as no launderer on earth is able to whiten. 
Mar
9:4  And there appeared to them Ĕliyahu
with Mosheh, and they were talking with יהושע.
Mar
9:5  And Kĕpha responding, said to יהושע,
“Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. And let us make three booths, one for
You, and one for Mosheh, and one for Ĕliyahu,” 
Mar
9:6  because he did not know what to say,
for they were exceedingly afraid. 
Mar
9:7  And there came a cloud overshadowing
them, and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, “This is My Son, the Beloved.
Hear Him!” 
Mar
9:8  And suddenly, looking around, they
no longer saw anyone with them, but only יהושע. 
Mar
9:9  And as they were coming down from
the mountain, He ordered them not to relate to anyone what they saw, till the
Son of Aḏam had risen from the dead. 
Mar
9:10  And they kept this matter to
themselves, debating what the rising from the dead meant. 
Mar
9:11  And they asked Him, saying, “Why do
the scribes say that Ĕliyahu has to come first?” 
Mar
9:12  And He said to them, “Ĕliyahu
indeed, having come first, restores all matters.
And how has it been written concerning the Son of Aḏam, that He is to
suffer much and be despised?
Mar
9:13  “But I say to you that even Ĕliyahu
has come, and they did to him whatever they wished, as it has been written of
him.” 
Mar
9:14  And coming to the taught ones, He
saw a large crowd around them, and scribes disputing with them. 
Mar
9:15  And immediately, when all the crowd
saw Him, they were greatly astonished, and running near, greeted Him. 
Mar
9:16  And He asked the scribes, “What are
you disputing with them?” 
Mar
9:17  And one of the crowd answering,
said, “Teacher, I brought You my son, who has a dumb spirit. 
Mar
9:18  “And wherever he seizes him, he
throws him down, and he foams at the
mouth, and gnashes his teeth, and he wastes away. And I spoke to Your
taught ones, that they should cast him out, but they were not able.” 
Mar
9:19  And He answered him and said, “O
unbelieving generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I put up
with you? Bring him to Me.” 
Mar
9:20  So they brought him to Him. And
when he saw Him, immediately the spirit threw him into convulsions. And falling
on the ground, he rolled about, foaming at
the mouth. 
Mar
9:21  And He asked his father, “How long
has he been like this?” And he said, “From childhood, 
Mar
9:22  and often he has thrown him both
into the fire and into the water to destroy him. But if it is at all possible
for You, have compassion on us and help us.” 
Mar
9:23  And יהושע
said to him, “If you are able to believe, all is possible to him who believes.”

Mar
9:24  And immediately the father of the
child cried out and said with tears, “I believe Master, help my unbelief!” 
Mar
9:25  And when יהושע
saw that a crowd came running together, He rebuked the unclean spirit, saying
to him, “You deaf and dumb spirit, I order you, come out of him, and never
again enter into him!” 
Mar
9:26  And crying out, and convulsing him
much, it came out of him. And he became as one dead, so that many said that he
was dead. 
Mar
9:27  But יהושע,
taking him by the hand, lifted him up, and he arose. 
Mar
9:28  And when He came into a house, His
taught ones asked Him separately, “Why were we unable to cast him out?” 
Mar
9:29  And He said to them, “It is
impossible for this kind to come out except through prayer and fasting.” 
Mar
9:30  And going from there they passed
through Galil. And He did not wish anyone to know, 
Mar
9:31  for He was teaching His taught ones
and said to them, “The Son of Aḏam is being delivered into the hands of
men, and they shall kill Him. And having been killed, He shall rise the third
day.” 
Mar
9:32  But they did not understand the
word, and they were afraid to ask Him. 
Mar
9:33  And they came to Kephar
Naḥum, and having come in the house He asked them, “What was it you
disputed among yourselves on the way?” 
Mar
9:34  And they were silent, for on the
way they had disputed with one another who was the greatest. 
Mar
9:35  And sitting down, He called the
twelve and said to them, “If anyone wishes to be first, he shall be last of all
and servant of all.” 
Mar
9:36  And He took a little child and set
him in their midst, and taking him in His arms, He said to them, 
Mar
9:37  “Whoever receives one of such
little children in My Name receives Me. And whoever receives Me, receives not
Me, but the One who sent Me.” 
Mar
9:38  And Yoḥanan said to Him, “Teacher,
we saw someone, who does not follow us, casting out demons in Your Name, and we
forbade him because he does not follow us.” 
Mar
9:39  And יהושע
said, “Do not forbid him, for no one who works a miracle in My Name is able to
readily speak evil of Me. 
Mar
9:40  “For he who is not against us is
for us. 
Mar
9:41  “For whoever gives you a cup of
water to drink in My Name, because you are of Messiah, truly, I say to you, he
shall by no means lose his reward. 
Mar
9:42  “And whoever causes one of these
little ones who believe in Me to stumble, it is better for him if a millstone
were hung around his neck, and he were thrown into the sea. 
Mar
9:43  “And if your hand makes you
stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life crippled, than
having two hands, to go into Gehenna, into the unquenchable fire, 
Mar
9:44  where ‘their worm does not die and
the fire is not quenched.’ 
Mar
9:45  “And if your foot makes you
stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life crippled, than
having two feet, to be thrown into Gehenna, into the unquenchable fire, 
Mar
9:46  where ‘their worm does not die and
the fire is not quenched.’ 
Mar
9:47  “And if your eye makes you stumble,
pluck it out. It is better for you to enter into the reign of Elohim with one
eye, than having two eyes, to be thrown into the fire of Gehenna, 
Mar
9:48  where ‘their worm does not die and
the fire is not quenched.’ 
Mar
9:49  “For everyone shall be seasoned
with fire, and every offering shall be seasoned with salt. 
Mar
9:50  “Salt is good, but if the salt
becomes tasteless, how shall you season it? Have salt in yourselves, and be at
peace among one another.” 
Mar
10:1  And rising up from there He came
into the borders of Yehuḏah by the other side of the Yardĕn. And
crowds gathered to Him again, and as He usually did, He was teaching them
again. 
Mar
10:2  And Pharisees came and asked Him, “Is
it right for a man to put away his wife?” – trying Him. 
Mar
10:3  And He answering, said to them, “What
did Mosheh command you?” 
Mar
10:4  And they said, “Mosheh allowed a
man to write a certificate of divorce, and to put her away.” 
Mar
10:5  And יהושע
said to them, “Because of the hardness of your heart he wrote you this command.

Mar
10:6  “However, from the beginning of the
creation, Elohim ‘made them male and female.’ 
Mar
10:7  ‘For this cause a man shall leave
his father and mother and cleave to his wife, 
Mar
10:8  and the two shall become one flesh,’
so that they are no longer two, but one flesh. 
Mar
10:9  “Therefore what Elohim has joined
together, let man not separate.” 
Mar
10:10  And in the house His taught ones
asked Him about this again. 
Mar
10:11  And He said to them, “Whoever puts
away his wife and marries another commits adultery against her. 
Mar
10:12  “And if a woman puts away her
husband and marries another, she commits adultery.”
Mar
10:13  And they were bringing little
children for Him to touch them, but the taught ones were rebuking those who
were bringing them. 
Mar
10:14  And when יהושע
saw it, He was much displeased and said to them, “Let the little children come
to Me, and do not forbid them, for of such is the reign of Elohim. 
Mar
10:15  “Truly, I say to you, whoever does
not receive the reign of Elohim as a little child, shall certainly not enter
into it.” 
Mar
10:16  And taking them up in His arms,
laying His hands on them, He blessed them. 
Mar
10:17  And as He was setting out on the
way, one came running, and knelt before Him, and asked Him, “Good Teacher, what
shall I do to inherit everlasting life?” 
Mar
10:18  And יהושע
said to him, “Why do you call Me good? No one is good except One – Elohim. 
Mar
10:19  “You know the commands, ‘Do not
commit adultery,’ ‘Do not murder,’ ‘Do not steal,’ ‘Do not bear false witness,’
‘Do not rob,’ ‘Respect your father and your mother.’ ” 
Mar
10:20  And he answering, said to Him, “Teacher,
all these I have watched over from my youth.” 
Mar
10:21  And יהושע,
looking at him, loved him, and said to him, “One matter you lack: Go, sell all you possess and give to the poor, and
you shall have treasure in heaven. And come, follow Me, taking up the stake.” 
Mar
10:22  But he, being sad at this word,
went away grieved, for he had many possessions. 
Mar
10:23  And יהושע,
looking around, said to His taught ones, “How hard it is for those who have
riches to enter into the reign of Elohim!” 
Mar
10:24  And the taught ones were
astonished at His words. And יהושע responding,
said to them again, “Children, how hard it is for those who trust in riches to
enter into the reign of Elohim! 
Mar
10:25  “It is easier for a camel to enter
through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the reign of Elohim.”

Mar
10:26  And they were immeasurably
astonished, saying among themselves, “Who then is able to be saved?” 
Mar
10:27  And looking at them, יהושע
said, “With men it is impossible, but not with Elohim, for with Elohim all is
possible.” 
Mar
10:28  And Kĕpha began to say to
Him, “See, we have left all and we have followed You.” 
Mar
10:29  יהושע
said, “Truly, I say to you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or
sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands, for the sake of Me and
the Good News, 
Mar
10:30  who shall not receive a
hundredfold now in this time, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and
children and lands, with persecutions, and in the age to come, everlasting
life. 
Mar
10:31  “But many who are first shall be
last, and the last first.” 
Mar
10:32  And they were on the way, going up
to Yerushalayim, and יהושע was going before them.
And they were astonished, and those who followed were afraid. And again He took
the twelve aside and began to say to them what was about to befall Him: 
Mar
10:33  “See, we are going up to
Yerushalayim, and the Son of Aḏam shall be delivered to the chief priests
and to the scribes, and they shall condemn Him to death and shall deliver Him
to the gentiles, 
Mar
10:34  and they shall mock Him, and flog
Him, and spit on Him, and kill Him. And the third day He shall rise again.” 
Mar
10:35  And Ya‛aqoḇ and
Yoḥanan, the sons of Zaḇdai, came up to Him, saying, “Teacher, we
wish that You would do for us whatever we ask.” 
Mar
10:36  And He said to them, “What do you
wish Me to do for you?” 
Mar
10:37  And they said to Him, “Grant us to
be seated in Your esteem, one on Your right hand and the other on Your left.” 
Mar
10:38  But יהושע
said to them, “You do not know what you ask. Are you able to drink the cup that
I drink, and be immersed with the immersion that I am immersed with?” 
Mar
10:39  And they said to Him, “We are
able.” And יהושע said to them, “You shall indeed
drink the cup that I drink, and with the immersion I am immersed with you shall
be immersed,
Mar
10:40  but to sit on My right hand and on
My left is not Mine to give, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared.”

Mar
10:41  And when the ten heard it, they
began to be sorely displeased with Ya‛aqoḇ and Yoḥanan. 
Mar
10:42  And יהושע,
calling them near, said to them, “You know that those who think to rule the
gentiles are masters over them, and their great ones exercise authority over
them. 
Mar
10:43  “But it is not so among you, but
whoever wishes to become great among you shall be your servant. 
Mar
10:44  “And whoever wishes to be first
among you, shall be servant of all. 
Mar
10:45  “For even the Son of Aḏam
did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for
many.” 
Mar
10:46  And they came to Yeriḥo. And
as He was leaving Yeriḥo with His taught ones and a large crowd, blind
Bartimai, the son of Timai, was sitting by the way begging. 
Mar
10:47  And when he heard that it was יהושע
of Natsareth, he began to cry out and to say, “ יהושע,
Son of Dawiḏ, have compassion on me!” 
Mar
10:48  And many were reprimanding him to
be silent, but he cried out all the more, “Son of Dawiḏ, have compassion
on me!” 
Mar
10:49  And יהושע
stopped and said, “Call him.” And they called the blind man, saying to him, “Take
courage, arise, He is calling you.” 
Mar
10:50  And he, throwing aside his
garment, rose and came to יהושע. 
Mar
10:51  And יהושע
responding, said to him, “What do you desire I do for you?” And the blind man
said to Him, “Rabboni, that I receive my sight.” 
Mar
10:52  And יהושע
said to him, “Go, your belief has healed you.” And immediately he saw again and
followed יהושע on the way. 
Mar
11:1  And when they came near
Yerushalayim, to Bĕyth Phaḡi and Bĕyth Anyah, at the Mount of
Olives, He sent out two of His taught ones, 
Mar
11:2  and said to them, “Go into the
village opposite you, and immediately entering into it, you shall find a colt
tied, on which no one has sat. Loosen it and bring it. 
Mar
11:3  “And if anyone says to you, ‘Why
are you doing this?’ say, ‘The Master needs it and shall send it back
straightaway.’ ” 
Mar
11:4  So they went away, and found the
colt tied by the door outside on the street, and they loosened it. 
Mar
11:5  And some of those standing there said
to them, “What are you doing, loosening the colt?” 
Mar
11:6  And they said to them, as יהושע
had said. So they let them go. 
Mar
11:7  And they brought the colt to יהושע
and threw their garments on it, and He sat on it. 
Mar
11:8  And many spread their garments on
the way, and others were cutting down branches from the trees and were
spreading them on the way. 
Mar
11:9  And those going before and those
following cried out, saying, “Hoshia-na! ‘Blessed is He who is coming in the
Name of יהוה !’ 
Mar
11:10  Blessed is the coming reign of our
father Dawiḏ – in the Name of יהוה ! Hoshia-na in
the highest!” 
Mar
11:11  And יהושע
went into Yerushalayim and into the Set-apart Place. And having looked around
on all, He went out to Bĕyth Anyah with the twelve, as the hour was
already late. 
Mar
11:12  And on the next day, when they had
come out from Bĕyth Anyah, He was hungry. 
Mar
11:13  And seeing at a distance a fig
tree having leaves, He went to see whether He would find any fruit on it. And when He came to it, He
found none but leaves, for it was not the season for figs. 
Mar
11:14  And יהושע,
responding, said to it, “Let no one eat fruit from you ever again.” And His
taught ones heard it. 
Mar
11:15  And they came to Yerushalayim. יהושע,
entering into the Set-apart Place, began to drive out those who bought and sold
in the Set-apart Place, and overturned the tables of the money-changers and the
seats of those selling doves. 
Mar
11:16  And He did not allow anyone to
carry a vessel through the Set-apart Place. 
Mar
11:17  And He was teaching, saying to
them, “Has it not been written, ‘My House shall be called a house of prayer for
all nations’? But you have made it a ‘den of robbers.’ ” 
Mar
11:18  And the scribes and the chief
priests heard it and they were seeking how to destroy Him, for they feared Him,
because all the crowd was astonished at His teaching. 
Mar
11:19  And when evening came, He went out
of the city. 
Mar
11:20  And in the morning, passing by,
they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots. 
Mar
11:21  Then Kĕpha, remembering, said
to Him, “Rabbi, look! The fig tree which You cursed has withered.” 
Mar
11:22  And יהושע
answering, said to them, “Have belief in Elohim. 
Mar
11:23  “For truly, I say to you, whoever
says to this mountain, ‘Be removed and be thrown into the sea,’ and does not
doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says, shall be done, he shall
have whatever he says. 
Mar
11:24  “Because of this I say to you,
whatever you ask when you pray, believe that you receive them, and you shall
have them. 
Mar
11:25  “And whenever you stand praying,
if you hold whatever against anyone, forgive, so that your Father in the
heavens shall also forgive you your trespasses. 
Mar
11:26  “But if you do not forgive,
neither shall your Father in the heavens forgive your trespasses.” 
Mar
11:27  And they came again to
Yerushalayim. And as He was walking in the Set-apart Place, the chief priests,
and the scribes, and the elders came to Him, 
Mar
11:28  and they said to Him, “By what
authority are You doing these? And who gave You this authority to do these?” 
Mar
11:29  And יהושע
answering, said to them, “I shall ask you one question, and answer Me, and I
shall say to you by what authority I do these: 
Mar
11:30  “The immersion of Yoḥanan – was
it from heaven or from men? Answer Me.” 
Mar
11:31  And they reasoned among
themselves, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ He shall say, ‘Then why did you
not believe him?’ 
Mar
11:32  “But if we say, ‘From men’ ” –
they feared the people, for all held that Yoḥanan was a prophet indeed. 
Mar
11:33  And answering they said to יהושע,
“We do not know.” And יהושע answering, said to
them, “Neither do I say to you by what authority I do these.” 
Mar
12:1  And He began to speak to them in
parables, “A man planted a vineyard and put a hedge around it, and dug a vat
for the winepress and built a watchtower, and let it out to farmers and went
away. 
Mar
12:2  “And at harvest time he sent a servant to the farmers, to receive some of
the fruit of the vineyard from the farmers. 
Mar
12:3  “And they seized him and beat him and sent him away empty-handed. 
Mar
12:4  “And again he sent them another
servant, and throwing stones at him, they wounded him in the head, and sent him away, having insulted him. 
Mar
12:5  “And again he sent another, and
they killed him; and many others, beating some and killing some. 
Mar
12:6  “He had one more son, his beloved.
He sent him last of all, saying, ‘They shall respect my son.’ 
Mar
12:7  “But those farmers said among
themselves, ‘This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall
be ours.’ 
Mar
12:8  “So they took him and killed him and threw him out of the vineyard. 
Mar
12:9  “What then shall the owner of the
vineyard do? He shall come and destroy the farmers, and give the vineyard to
others. 
Mar
12:10  “Have you not read this Scripture,
‘The stone which the builders rejected has become the chief corner-stone. 
Mar
12:11  ‘This was from יהוה,
and it is marvellous in our eyes’?” 
Mar
12:12  And they were seeking to seize
Him, but feared the crowd, for they knew He had spoken the parable against
them. And leaving Him, they went away. 
Mar
12:13  And they sent to Him some of the
Pharisees and the Herodians, to catch Him in a word. 
Mar
12:14  And when they came, they said to
Him, “Teacher, we know that You are true, and it does not concern You about
anyone, for You are not partial to any, but teach the way of Elohim in truth.
Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar, or not? 
Mar
12:15  “Should we pay, or should we not
pay?” And He, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, “Why do you try Me? Bring
Me a silver piece to look at.” 
Mar
12:16  And they brought it, and He said
to them, “Whose likeness and inscription is this?” And they said to Him, “Caesar’s.”

Mar
12:17  So יהושע
said to them, “Give to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to Elohim what is Elohim’s.”
And they marvelled at Him. 
Mar
12:18  And Sadducees, who say there is no
resurrection, came to Him. And they asked Him, saying, 
Mar
12:19  “Teacher, Mosheh wrote to us that
if a brother of anyone dies, and leaves his wife behind, and leaves no
children, his brother should take his wife and raise up offspring for his
brother. 
Mar
12:20  “There were seven brothers, and
the first took a wife, and died, leaving no offspring. 
Mar
12:21  “And the second took her, and he
died, leaving behind no offspring. And the third likewise. 
Mar
12:22  “And the seven left no offspring.
Last of all the woman died too. 
Mar
12:23  “In the resurrection then, when
they rise, whose wife shall she be? For seven had her as wife.” 
Mar
12:24  And יהושע
answering, said to them, “Is this not why you go astray, because you do not
know the Scriptures nor the power of Elohim?
Mar
12:25  “For when they rise from the dead,
they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are as messengers in the
heavens. 
Mar
12:26  “And concerning the dead, that
they rise – have you not read in the book of Mosheh, at the bush, how Elohim
spoke to him, saying, ‘I am the Elohim of Aḇraham, and the Elohim of
Yitsḥaq, and the Elohim of Ya‛aqoḇ’? 
Mar
12:27  “He is not the Elohim of the dead,
but Elohim of the living. You, then, go greatly astray.” 
Mar
12:28  And one of the scribes coming
near, hearing them reasoning together, knowing that He had answered them well,
asked Him, “Which is the first command of all?” 
Mar
12:29  And יהושע
answered him, “The first of all the commands is, ‘Hear, O Yisra’ĕl, יהוה
our Elohim, יהוה is one. 
Mar
12:30  ‘And you shall love יהוה
your Elohim with all your heart, and with all your being, and with all your
mind, and with all your strength.’ This is the first command. 
Mar
12:31  “And the second, like it, is this,
‘You shall love your neighbour as yourself.’ There is no other command greater
than these.” 
Mar
12:32  And the scribe said to Him, “Well
said, Teacher. You have spoken the truth, for there is one Elohim, and there is
no other besides Him. 
Mar
12:33  “And to love Him with all the
heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the being, and with all the
strength, and to love one’s neighbour as oneself, is more than all the burnt
offerings and offerings.” 
Mar
12:34  And when יהושע
saw that he answered wisely, He said to him, “You are not far from the reign of
Elohim.” And after that no one was bold enough
to question Him. 
Mar
12:35  And יהושע
responding, said, while teaching in the Set-apart Place, “How is it that the
scribes say that the Messiah is the Son of Dawiḏ? 
Mar
12:36  “Dawiḏ himself said by the
Set-apart Spirit, ‘ יהוה said to my Master, “Sit at My
right hand, until I make Your enemies a footstool of Your feet.” ’ 
Mar
12:37  “Dawiḏ himself calls Him ‘Master.’
In what way then is He his Son?” And the large crowd heard Him gladly. 
Mar
12:38  And in His teaching He was saying
to them, “Beware of the scribes, who like to walk around in long robes, and like greetings in the market-places, 
Mar
12:39  and the best seats in the
congregations, and the best places at feasts, 
Mar
12:40  who are devouring widows’ houses,
and for a show make long prayers. These shall receive greater judgment.” 
Mar
12:41  And sitting opposite the treasury
He saw how the people put copper into the treasury. And many rich ones put in
much. 
Mar
12:42  And a poor widow came and threw in
two small copper coins, which amount to a cent. 
Mar
12:43  And calling near His taught ones
He said to them, “Truly, I say to you that this poor widow has put in more than
all those putting into the treasury, 
Mar
12:44  for they all put in out of their
excess, but she out of her poverty put in all that she had, her entire
livelihood.” 
Mar
13:1  And as He went out of the Set-apart
Place, one of His taught ones said to Him, “Teacher, see what stones! And what
buildings!” 
Mar
13:2  And יהושע
answering, said to him, “Do you see these great buildings? Not one stone shall be
left upon another at all, which shall not be thrown down.”
Mar
13:3  And as He sat on the Mount of
Olives opposite the Set-apart Place, Kĕpha, and Ya‛aqoḇ, and
Yoḥanan, and Andri asked Him separately, 
Mar
13:4  “Say to us, when shall these events be? And what shall be the sign
when all this is going to be accomplished?” 
Mar
13:5  And יהושע
began to say to them, “Take heed that no one leads you astray, 
Mar
13:6  for many shall come in My Name,
saying, ‘I am He,’ and they shall lead many astray. 
Mar
13:7  “And when you hear of fightings and
reports of fightings, do not be troubled – it has to take place, but the end is
not yet. 
Mar
13:8  “For nation shall rise against
nation, and reign against reign. And there shall be earthquakes in various
places, and there shall be scarcities of food, and disturbances. These are the
beginnings of birth-pains. 
Mar
13:9  “But take heed to yourselves, for
they shall deliver you up to councils and to congregations. You shall be
beaten, and you shall be brought before rulers and sovereigns for My sake, for
a witness to them. 
Mar
13:10  “And the Good News has to be
proclaimed first to all the nations. 
Mar
13:11  “And when they lead you away and
deliver you up, do not worry beforehand what you are to say. But whatever is
given you in that hour, speak that, for it is not you who are speaking, but the
Set-apart Spirit. 
Mar
13:12  “And brother shall deliver up
brother to death, and a father his child. And children shall rise up against
parents and shall put them to death. 
Mar
13:13  “And you shall be hated by all
because of My Name. But he who shall have endured to the end, he shall be
saved.
Mar
13:14  “And when you see the ‘abomination
that lays waste,’ spoken of by Dani’ĕl the prophet, set up where it should
not be” – he who reads, let him understand – “then let those who are in Yehuḏah
flee to the mountains.
Mar
13:15  “And he who is on the house-top,
let him not go down into the house, nor come in to take whatever out of his
house. 
Mar
13:16  “And he who is in the field, let
him not go back to get his cloak. 
Mar
13:17  “And woe to those who are pregnant
and to those nursing children in those days! 
Mar
13:18  “And pray that your flight does
not take place in winter. 
Mar
13:19  “For in those days there shall be
distress, such as has not been from the beginning of creation which Elohim
created until this time, nor ever shall be. 
Mar
13:20  “And if the Master had not
shortened those days, no flesh would have been saved; but because of the chosen
ones, whom He chose, He shortened the days. 
Mar
13:21  “And if anyone then says to you, ‘Look,
here is the Messiah!’ or, ‘Look, there!’ do not believe it. 
Mar
13:22  “For false messiahs and false
prophets shall rise and show signs and wonders to lead astray, if possible,
even the chosen ones. 
Mar
13:23  “And you, take heed. See, I have
forewarned you of it all. 
Mar
13:24  “But in those days, after that
distress, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give its light, 
Mar
13:25  and the stars of heaven shall
fall, and the powers in the heavens shall be shaken. 
Mar
13:26  “And then they shall see the Son
of Aḏam coming in the clouds with much power and esteem. 
Mar
13:27  “And then He shall send His
messengers, and assemble His chosen ones from the four winds, from the farthest
part of earth to the farthest part of heaven. 
Mar
13:28  “And learn this parable from the
fig tree: When its branch has already become tender, and puts forth leaves, you
know that the summer is near. 
Mar
13:29  “So you also, when you see these
taking place, know that it is near, at the door. 
Mar
13:30  “Truly, I say to you, this
generation shall by no means pass away till all this takes place. 
Mar
13:31  “The heaven and the earth shall
pass away, but My words shall by no means pass away. 
Mar
13:32  “But concerning that day and the
hour no one knows, not even the messengers in heaven, nor the Son, but only the
Father. 
Mar
13:33  “Take heed, watch and pray, for
you do not know when the time is – 
Mar
13:34  as a man going abroad, having left
his house and given authority to his servants, and to each his work, and
commanded the doorkeeper to watch. 
Mar
13:35  “Watch therefore, for you do not
know when the master of the house is coming – in the evening or at midnight, or
at the crowing of the cock, or in the morning, 
Mar
13:36  lest, coming suddenly, he should
find you sleeping. 
Mar
13:37  “And what I say to you, I say to
all: Watch!” 
Mar
14:1  Now the Passover and the Festival of Unleavened Bread was after
two days. And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how to take Him
through treachery and put Him to death. 
Mar
14:2  And they said, “Not at the
festival, lest there shall be an uproar of the people.” 
Mar
14:3  And while He was in Bĕyth
Anyah in the house of Shim‛on the leper, and sitting at the table, a
woman came having an alabaster flask of perfume, genuine nard, very costly. And
breaking the flask she poured it on His head. 
Mar
14:4  But there were some who were much
displeased among themselves, and said, “Why was this perfume wasted? 
Mar
14:5  “For it could have been sold for
more than three hundred pieces of silver and given to the poor.” And they were
scolding her. 
Mar
14:6  But יהושע
said, “Leave her alone. Why do you trouble her? She has done a good work for
Me. 
Mar
14:7  “For you have the poor with you
always, and you are able do good to them, whenever you wish. But you do not
always have Me. 
Mar
14:8  “What she had, she used. She took
it beforehand to anoint My body for the burial. 
Mar
14:9  “Truly, I say to you, wherever this
Good News is proclaimed in all the world, what this woman did shall also be
spoken of, to her remembrance.” 
Mar
14:10  And Yehuḏah from Qerioth,
one of the twelve, went to the chief priests to deliver Him up to them. 
Mar
14:11  And when they heard it, they were
glad, and promised to give him silver. And he was seeking how to deliver Him
up, conveniently. 
Mar
14:12  And on the first day of Unleavened
Bread, when they were slaughtering the Passover lamb, His taught ones said to
Him, “Where do You wish us to go and prepare, for You to eat the Passover?” 
Mar
14:13  And He sent out two of His taught
ones and said to them, “Go into the city, and there a man bearing a jar of
water shall meet you, follow him. 
Mar
14:14  “And wherever he enters, say to
the master of the house, ‘The Teacher says, “Where is the guest room in which I
am to eat the Passover with My taught ones?” ’ 
Mar
14:15  “And he shall show you a large
upper room, furnished, ready. Prepare for us there.” 
Mar
14:16  And His taught ones went out and
came into the city, and found it as He said to them, and they prepared the
Passover. 
Mar
14:17  And evening having come, He came
with the twelve. 
Mar
14:18  And as they sat and ate, יהושע
said, “Truly, I say to you, one of you who is eating with Me shall deliver Me
up.” 
Mar
14:19  And they began to be grieved, and
to say to Him one by one, “Is it I?” And another, “Is it I?” 
Mar
14:20  And He answering, said to them, “It
is one of the twelve, he who is dipping with Me in the dish. 
Mar
14:21  “The Son of Aḏam is indeed
going, as it has been written of Him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Aḏam
is delivered up! It would have been good for that man if he had not been born.”

Mar
14:22  And as they were eating, יהושע
took bread, having blessed, broke it, gave it to them and said, “Take, eat,
this is My body.” 
Mar
14:23  And taking the cup, giving thanks,
He gave it to them, and they all drank from it. 
Mar
14:24  And He said to them, “This is My blood,
that of the renewed covenant, which is shed for many. 
Mar
14:25  “Truly, I say to you, I shall
certainly no more drink of the fruit of the vine till that day when I drink it
anew in the reign of Elohim.” 
Mar
14:26  And having sung a song, they went
out to the Mount of Olives. 
Mar
14:27  And יהושע
said to them, “All of you shall stumble in Me this night, for it has been
written, ‘I shall strike the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.’ 
Mar
14:28  “But after I am raised, I shall go
before you to Galil.” 
Mar
14:29  And Kĕpha said to Him, “Even
if all shall stumble, yet not I.” 
Mar
14:30  And יהושע
said to him, “Truly, I say to you that today, this night, before the cock shall
crow twice, you shall deny Me three times.” 
Mar
14:31  But he spoke more strongly, “If I
have to die with You, I shall not deny You!” And they all said the same. 
Mar
14:32  And they came to a place called
Gethsemane. And He said to His taught ones, “Sit here while I pray.” 
Mar
14:33  And He took with Him Kĕpha,
and Ya‛aqoḇ, and Yoḥanan, and He began to be greatly amazed,
and to be deeply distressed. 
Mar
14:34  And He said to them, “My being is
exceedingly grieved, even to death. Stay here and watch.” 
Mar
14:35  And He went on a little, and fell
on the ground, and was praying that if it were possible, the hour might pass
from Him. 
Mar
14:36  And He said, “Abba, Father, all is
possible for You. Make this cup pass from Me. Yet not what I desire, but what
You desire.” 
Mar
14:37  And He came and found them
sleeping, and said to Kĕpha, “Shim‛on, are you sleeping? You were
not able to watch one hour! 
Mar
14:38  “Watch and pray, lest you enter
into trial. The spirit indeed is eager, but the flesh is weak.” 
Mar
14:39  And again He went away and prayed,
and spoke the same words. 
Mar
14:40  And having returned, He found them
asleep again, for their eyes were heavy. And they did not know what to answer
Him.
Mar
14:41  And He came the third time and
said to them, “Are you still sleeping and resting? It is enough! The hour has
come. See, the Son of Aḏam is being delivered up into the hands of the
sinners. 
Mar
14:42  “Rise up, let us go. See, he who
is delivering Me up has drawn near.” 
Mar
14:43  And immediately, while He was
still speaking, Yehuḏah, one of the twelve, with a large crowd with
swords and clubs, came from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders. 
Mar
14:44  And the one who was delivering Him
up had given them a signal, saying, “Whomever I kiss, it is He – seize Him and
lead Him away safely.” 
Mar
14:45  And coming, going straight up to
Him, he said to Him, “Rabbi, Rabbi!” and kissed Him. 
Mar
14:46  And they laid their hands on Him
and seized Him. 
Mar
14:47  And one of those standing by drew
his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear. 
Mar
14:48  And יהושע
answering, said to them, “Have you come out as against a robber, with swords
and clubs, to take Me? 
Mar
14:49  “Daily I was with you in the
Set-apart Place teaching, and you did not seize Me. But let the Scriptures be
filled.” 
Mar
14:50  And they all left Him and fled. 
Mar
14:51  And a certain young man was
following Him, having a linen cloth thrown around his naked body. And when
they seized him, 
Mar
14:52  he left the linen cloth and fled
from them naked. 
Mar
14:53  And they led יהושע
away to the high priest. And all the chief priests, and the elders, and the
scribes came together to Him. 
Mar
14:54  And Kĕpha followed Him at a
distance, even into the courtyard of the high priest. And he was sitting with
the officers and warming himself at the fire. 
Mar
14:55  And the chief priests and all the
council were seeking witness against יהושע to put
Him to death, and they were finding none. 
Mar
14:56  For many bore false witness against
Him, but their evidences did not agree. 
Mar
14:57  And some rose up and bore false
witness against Him, saying, 
Mar
14:58  “We heard Him saying, ‘I shall
destroy this Dwelling Place that is made with hands, and within three days I
shall build another made without hands.’ ” 
Mar
14:59  And not even then did their
witness agree. 
Mar
14:60  Then the high priest stood up in
the centre and asked יהושע, saying, “Have You no
answer to make? What do these witness against You?” 
Mar
14:61  But He remained silent and gave no
answer. Again the high priest asked Him, saying to Him, “Are You the Messiah,
the Son of the Blessed?” 
Mar
14:62  And יהושע
said, “I am, and you shall see the Son of Aḏam sitting at the right hand
of the Power, and coming with the clouds of the heaven.” 
Mar
14:63  And tearing his garments, the high
priest said, “What further need do we have of witnesses? 
Mar
14:64  “You have heard the blasphemy!
What do you think?” And they all condemned Him to be liable to death. 
Mar
14:65  And some began to spit on Him, and
to blindfold Him, and to beat Him, and to say to Him, “Prophesy!” And the
officers struck Him with the palms of their hands. 
Mar
14:66  And as Kĕpha was below in the
courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came, 
Mar
14:67  and seeing Kĕpha warming
himself, she looked at him and said, “And you were with יהושע
of Natsareth.” 
Mar
14:68  But he denied it, saying, “I do
not know nor understand what you are saying.” And he went out onto the porch,
and a cock crowed. 
Mar
14:69  And the servant girl saw him
again, and began to say to those who stood by, “This is one of them.” 
Mar
14:70  And again he was denying it. And
after a little while those who stood by again said to Kĕpha, “Truly you
are one of them, for you are a Galilean too, and your speech is alike.” 
Mar
14:71  And he began to curse and swear, “I
do not know this Man of whom you speak!” 
Mar
14:72  And a second time the cock crowed.
And Kĕpha remembered the word that יהושע had
said to him, “Before the cock crows twice, you shall deny Me three times.” And
thinking on it, he wept. 
Mar
15:1  And immediately, in the morning,
the chief priests had a council meeting
with the elders and scribes and all the council. Having bound יהושע,
they led Him away, and delivered Him to Pilate. 
Mar
15:2  And Pilate asked Him, “Are You the
Sovereign of the Yehuḏim?” And He answering, said to him, “You say it.” 
Mar
15:3  And the chief priests accused Him
of much, but He made no answer. 
Mar
15:4  And Pilate again asked Him, saying,
“Have You no answer? See how much they witness against You!” 
Mar
15:5  But יהושע
still gave no answer, so that Pilate marvelled. 
Mar
15:6  And at a festival he released to
them one prisoner, whomever they were asking. 
Mar
15:7  And there was one called Barabba,
chained with his fellow rebels, who had committed murder in the uprising. 
Mar
15:8  And the crowd, crying aloud, began
to ask, as he had always done for them. 
Mar
15:9  But Pilate answered them, saying, “Do
you wish me to release for you the Sovereign of the Yehuḏim?” 
Mar
15:10  For he knew that the chief priests
had handed Him over because of envy. 
Mar
15:11  And the chief priests stirred up
the crowd, that he should rather release Barabba to them. 
Mar
15:12  And Pilate answered and again said
to them, “What then do you wish me to do to
Him whom you call the Sovereign of the Yehuḏim?” 
Mar
15:13  And again they cried out, “Impale
Him!”
Mar
15:14  And Pilate said to them, “Why,
what evil has He done?” And they vehemently cried out, “Impale Him!” 
Mar
15:15  And Pilate, wishing to satisfy the
crowd, released Barabba to them, and having whipped Him, he delivered יהושע over to be
impaled. 
Mar
15:16  And the soldiers led Him away into
the court, which is the palace, and they called together the entire company of soldiers, 
Mar
15:17  and decked Him with purple. And
they plaited a crown of thorns, put it on Him, 
Mar
15:18  and they began to call out to Him,
“Greetings, Sovereign of the Yehuḏim!” 
Mar
15:19  And they kept beating Him on the
head with a reed and were spitting on Him. And bending the knee, they were
bowing down to Him. 
Mar
15:20  And when they had mocked Him, they
took the purple off Him, and put His own garments on Him, and led Him out to
impale Him. 
Mar
15:21  And they compelled a passer-by,
Shim‛on, a Cyrenian, coming from a field, the father of Alexander and
Rufus, to bear His stake. 
Mar
15:22  And they brought Him to the place
Golgotha, which is translated, Place of a Skull.
Mar
15:23  And they were giving Him wine
mixed with myrrh to drink, but He did not take it. 
Mar
15:24  And when they impaled Him, they
divided His garments, casting lots for them, what each one should take. 
Mar
15:25  And it was the third hour, and
they impaled Him. 
Mar
15:26  And the inscription of His
accusation was written above: THE SOVEREIGN OF THE YEHUḎIM. 
Mar
15:27  And with Him they impaled two
robbers, one on His right and the other on His left.
Mar
15:28  And the Scripture was filled which
says, “And He was reckoned with the lawless.” 
Mar
15:29  And those passing by were
blaspheming Him, shaking their heads and saying, “Ah! You who destroy the
Dwelling Place and build it in three days, 
Mar
15:30  save Yourself, and come down from
the stake!” 
Mar
15:31  And likewise the chief priests and
the scribes, mocking to one another said, “He saved others, He is unable to
save Himself. 
Mar
15:32  “The Messiah? The Sovereign of
Yisra’ĕl? Come down now from the stake, so that we see and believe.” And
those who were impaled with Him were reproaching Him. 
Mar
15:33  And when the sixth hour came,
darkness came over all the land until the ninth hour. 
Mar
15:34  And at the ninth hour יהושע
cried out with a loud voice, saying, “Ĕli, Ĕli, lamah sheḇaqtani?”
which is translated, “My Ĕl, My Ĕl, why have You forsaken Me?”
Mar
15:35  And some of those standing by,
when they heard it, said, “See, He is calling for Ĕliyahu!” 
Mar
15:36  And someone ran and filled a
sponge with sour wine, and put it on a reed, and offered it to Him to drink,
saying, “Leave Him, let us see if Ĕliyahu does come to take Him down.” 
Mar
15:37  And יהושע
cried out with a loud voice, and breathed His last. 
Mar
15:38  And the veil of the Dwelling Place
was torn in two from top to bottom. 
Mar
15:39  And when the captain, who was
standing opposite Him, saw that He cried out like this and breathed His last,
he said, “Truly this Man was the Son of Elohim!” 
Mar
15:40  And there were also women watching
from a distance, among whom was also Miryam from Maḡdala, and Miryam the
mother of Ya‛aqoḇ the Less and of Yosĕph, and Shelomah, 
Mar
15:41  who also followed Him and attended
Him when He was in Galil, and many other women who came up with Him to
Yerushalayim. 
Mar
15:42  And when evening had come, because
it was the Preparation Day, that is, the day before the Sabbath, 
Mar
15:43  Yosĕph of Ramathayim, a
prominent council member, who was himself waiting for the reign of Elohim,
came, boldly went in to Pilate and asked for the body of יהושע.

Mar
15:44  But Pilate wondered whether He was
already dead, so summoning the captain, he asked him if He was already dead. 
Mar
15:45  And when he learned this from the captain, he gave the body
to Yosĕph. 
Mar
15:46  And he, having bought fine linen,
took Him down, and wrapped Him in the linen. And he laid Him in a tomb which
had been hewn out of the rock, and rolled a stone against the entrance of the
tomb. 
Mar
15:47  And Miryam from Maḡdala, and
Miryam the mother of Yosĕph, saw
where He was laid. 
Mar
16:1  And when the Sabbath was past, Miryam
from Maḡdala, and Miryam the mother
of Ya‛aqoḇ, and Shelomah bought spices, to go and anoint Him. 
Mar
16:2  And very early on the first day of
the week, they came to the tomb when the sun had risen. 
Mar
16:3  And they said among themselves, “Who
shall roll away the stone from the entrance of the tomb for us?” 
Mar
16:4  And looking up, they saw that the
stone had been rolled away, for it was extremely large. 
Mar
16:5  And having entered into the tomb,
they saw a young man sitting on the right, wearing a white robe, and they were
greatly astonished. 
Mar
16:6  And he said to them, “Do not be
much astonished. You seek יהושע of Natsareth, who
was impaled. He was raised – He is not here! See the place where they laid Him.
Mar
16:7  “And go, say to His taught ones,
and Kĕpha, that He is going before you into Galil. You shall see Him there
as He said to you.” 
Mar
16:8  And they went out and fled from the
tomb, and were trembling and bewildered. And they spoke to no one, for they
were afraid. 
Mar
16:9  And having risen early on the first
day of the week, He appeared first to Miryam from Maḡdala, from whom He
had cast out seven demons. 
Mar
16:10  She went and reported to those who
had been with Him, mourning and weeping. 
Mar
16:11  And when they heard that He was
alive and had been seen by her, they did not believe. 
Mar
16:12  And after this He appeared in
another form to two of them as they walked and went into a field. 
Mar
16:13  And they went and reported it to
the rest, but they did not believe them either. 
Mar
16:14  Later He appeared to the eleven as
they sat at the table. And He reproached their unbelief and hardness of heart,
because they did not believe those who had seen Him after He was raised. 
Mar
16:15  And He said to them, “Go into all
the world and proclaim the Good News to every creature. 
Mar
16:16  “He who has believed and has been
immersed, shall be saved, but he who has not believed shall be condemned. 
Mar
16:17  “And these signs shall accompany
the ones who believe: In My Name they shall cast out demons, they shall speak
with renewed tongues, 
Mar
16:18  they shall take up snakes, and if
they drink any deadly drink it shall
by no means hurt them, they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall get
well.” 
Mar
16:19  Then indeed, after the Master had
spoken to them, He was received up into the heaven, and sat down at the right
hand of Elohim. 
Mar
16:20  And they went out and proclaimed
it everywhere, while the Master worked with them, and confirmed the word
through the accompanying signs. Amĕn.
