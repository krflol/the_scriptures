Shemoth/Exodus
Exod
1:1  And these are the names of the
children of Yisra’ĕl who came to Mitsrayim with Ya‛aqoḇ, each
one with his household: 
Exod
1:2  Re’uḇĕn, Shim‛on, Lĕwi,
and Yehuḏah; 
Exod
1:3  Yissasḵar, Zeḇulun, and
Binyamin; 
Exod
1:4  Dan and Naphtali, Gaḏ and Ashĕr.

Exod
1:5  And all those who were descendants
of Ya‛aqoḇ were seventy beings, as Yosĕph was already in Mitsrayim.

Exod
1:6  And Yosĕph died, and all his
brothers, and all that generation. 
Exod
1:7  And the children of Yisra’ĕl
bore fruit and increased very much, multiplied and became very strong, and the
land was filled with them. 
Exod
1:8  Then a new sovereign arose over
Mitsrayim, who did not know Yosĕph, 
Exod
1:9  and he said to his people, “See, the
people of the children of Yisra’ĕl are more and stronger than we, 
Exod
1:10  come, let us act wisely towards
them, lest they increase, and it shall be when fighting befalls us, that they
shall join our enemies and fight against us, and shall go up out of the land.” 
Exod
1:11  So they set slave-masters over them
to afflict them with their burdens, and they built for Pharaoh supply cities,
Pithom and Ra‛amses. 
Exod
1:12  But the more they afflicted them,
the more they increased and grew, and they were in dread of the children of
Yisra’ĕl. 
Exod
1:13  And the Mitsrites made the children
of Yisra’ĕl serve with harshness, 
Exod
1:14  and they made their lives bitter
with hard bondage, in mortar, and in brick, and in all kinds of work in the
field, all their work which they made them do was with harshness. 
Exod
1:15  Then the sovereign of Mitsrayim
spoke to the Heḇrew midwives, of whom the name of one was Shiphrah and
the name of the other Pu‛ah, 
Exod
1:16  and he said, “When you deliver the
Heḇrew women, and see them on the birthstools, if it is a son, then you
shall put him to death, but if it is a daughter, then she shall live.” 
Exod
1:17  But the midwives feared Elohim, and
did not do as the sovereign of Mitsrayim commanded them, and kept the male
children alive. 
Exod
1:18  So the sovereign of Mitsrayim
called for the midwives and said to them, “Why have you done this, and kept the
male children alive?” 
Exod
1:19  And the midwives said to Pharaoh, “Because
the Heḇrew women are not like the Mitsrite women. For they are lively and
give birth before the midwives come to them.” 
Exod
1:20  So Elohim was good to the midwives,
and the people increased and became very numerous. 
Exod
1:21  And it came to be, because the
midwives feared Elohim, that He provided households for them. 
Exod
1:22  And Pharaoh commanded all his
people, saying, “Throw every son who is born into the river, and keep alive every
daughter.” 
Exod
2:1  And a man of the house of Lĕwi
went and married a daughter of Lĕwi. 
Exod
2:2  And the woman conceived and bore a
son. And she saw that he was a lovely child, and she hid him three months. 
Exod
2:3  And when she could hide him no
longer, she took an ark of wicker for him, and coated it with tar and pitch,
and put the child in it, and laid it in the reeds by the edge of the river. 
Exod
2:4  And his sister stood at a distance,
to know what would be done to him. 
Exod
2:5  And the daughter of Pharaoh came
down to wash herself at the river, and her young women were walking by the
river-side. And when she saw the ark among the reeds, she sent her female
servant to get it, 
Exod
2:6  and opened it and saw the child, and
see, the baby wept. So she had compassion on him, and said, “This is one of the
children of the Heḇrews.” 
Exod
2:7  And his sister said to Pharaoh’s
daughter, “Shall I go and call a nurse for you from the Heḇrew women to
nurse the child for you?” 
Exod
2:8  And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Go.”
And the girl went and called the child’s mother. 
Exod
2:9  And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Take
this child away and nurse him for me, then I shall pay your wages.” So the
woman took the child and nursed him. 
Exod
2:10  And the child grew, and she brought
him to Pharaoh’s daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name
Mosheh, saying, “Because I have drawn him out of the water.” 
Exod
2:11  And in those days it came to be,
when Mosheh was grown, that he went out to his brothers and looked at their
burdens. And he saw a Mitsrite beating a Heḇrew, one of his brothers. 
Exod
2:12  So he turned this way and that way,
and when he saw no one, he smote the Mitsrite and hid him in the sand. 
Exod
2:13  And he went out the second day and
saw two Heḇrew men fighting, and he said to the one who did the wrong, “Why
do you smite your neighbour?” 
Exod
2:14  And he said, “Who made you a head
and a judge over us? Do you intend to slay me as you slew the Mitsrite?” And
Mosheh feared and said, “Truly, the matter is known!” 
Exod
2:15  And Pharaoh heard of this matter,
and he sought to kill Mosheh. But Mosheh fled from the face of Pharaoh and
dwelt in the land of Miḏyan. And he sat down by a well. 
Exod
2:16  And the priest of Miḏyan had
seven daughters. And they came and drew water, and they filled the troughs to
water their father’s flock, 
Exod
2:17  but the shepherds came and drove
them away. Then Mosheh stood up and came to their rescue, and watered their
flock. 
Exod
2:18  And they came to Re‛uw’ĕl
their father, and he said, “How is it that you have come so soon today?” 
Exod
2:19  And they said, “A Mitsrite rescued
us from the hand of the shepherds, and he also drew enough water for us and
watered the flock.” 
Exod
2:20  And he said to his daughters, “And
where is he? Why did you leave the man? Call him and let him eat bread.” 
Exod
2:21  And Mosheh agreed to dwell with the
man, and he gave Tsipporah his daughter to Mosheh. 
Exod
2:22  And she bore him a son, and he
called his name Gĕreshom, for he said, “I have become a sojourner in a
foreign land.” 
Exod
2:23  And it came to be after these many
days that the sovereign of Mitsrayim died. And the children of Yisra’ĕl
groaned because of the slavery, and they cried out. And their cry came up to
Elohim because of the slavery.
Exod
2:24  And Elohim heard their groaning,
and Elohim remembered His covenant with Aḇraham, with Yitsḥaq, and
with Ya‛aqoḇ. 
Exod
2:25  And Elohim looked on the children
of Yisra’ĕl, and Elohim knew! 
Exod
3:1  And Mosheh was shepherding the flock
of Yithro his father-in-law, the priest of Miḏyan. And he led the flock
to the back of the wilderness, and came to Ḥorĕḇ, the mountain
of Elohim. 
Exod
3:2  And the Messenger of יהוה
appeared to him in a flame of fire from the midst of a bush. And he looked and
saw the bush burning with fire, but the bush was not consumed. 
Exod
3:3  And Mosheh said, “Let me turn aside
now, and see this great sight, why the bush does not burn.” 
Exod
3:4  And יהוה saw
that he turned aside to see, and Elohim called to him from the midst of the
bush and said, “Mosheh! Mosheh!” And he said, “Here I am.” 
Exod
3:5  And He said, “Do not come near here.
Take your sandals off your feet, for the place on which you are standing is
set-apart ground.” 
Exod
3:6  And He said, “I am the Elohim of
your father, the Elohim of Aḇraham, the Elohim of Yitsḥaq, and the
Elohim of Ya‛aqoḇ.” And Mosheh hid his face, for he was afraid to
look at Elohim. 
Exod
3:7  And יהוה
said, “I have indeed seen the oppression of My people who are in Mitsrayim, and
have heard their cry because of their slave-drivers, for I know their sorrows. 
Exod
3:8  “And I have come down to deliver
them from the hand of the Mitsrites, and to bring them up from that land to a
good and spacious land, to a land flowing with milk and honey, to the place of
the Kena‛anites and the Ḥittites and the Amorites and the
Perizzites and the Ḥiwwites and the Yeḇusites. 
Exod
3:9  “And now, see, the cry of the
children of Yisra’ĕl has come to Me, and I have also seen the oppression
with which the Mitsrites oppress them. 
Exod
3:10  “And now, come, I am sending you to
Pharaoh, to bring My people, the children of Yisra’ĕl, out of Mitsrayim.” 
Exod
3:11  And Mosheh said to Elohim, “Who am
I that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring the children of Yisra’ĕl
out of Mitsrayim?” 
Exod
3:12  And He said, “Because I am with
you. And this is to you the sign that I have sent you: When you have brought
the people out of Mitsrayim, you are to serve Elohim on this mountain.” 
Exod
3:13  And Mosheh said to Elohim, “See,
when I come to the children of Yisra’ĕl and say to them, ‘The Elohim of
your fathers has sent me to you,’ and they say to me, ‘What is His Name?’ what
shall I say to them?” 
Exod
3:14  And Elohim said to Mosheh, “I am
that which I am.” And He said, “Thus you shall say to the children of Yisra’ĕl,
‘I am has sent me to you.’ ”
Exod
3:15  And Elohim said further to Mosheh, “Thus
you are to say to the children of Yisra’ĕl, ‘ יהוה
Elohim of your fathers, the Elohim of Aḇraham, the Elohim of
Yitsḥaq, and the Elohim of Ya‛aqoḇ, has sent me to you. This
is My Name forever, and this is My remembrance to all generations.’ 
Exod
3:16  “Go, and you shall gather the
elders of Yisra’ĕl together, and say to them, ‘ יהוה
Elohim of your fathers, the Elohim of Aḇraham, of Yitsḥaq, and of
Ya‛aqoḇ, appeared to me, saying, “I have indeed visited you and
seen what is done to you in Mitsrayim; 
Exod
3:17  and I say: I am bringing you up out
of the affliction of Mitsrayim to the land of the Kena‛anite and the Ḥittite
and the Amorite and the Perizzite and the Ḥiwwite and the Yeḇusite,
to a land flowing with milk and honey.” ’ 
Exod
3:18  “And they shall listen to your
voice. And you shall come, you and the elders of Yisra’ĕl, to the
sovereign of Mitsrayim, and you shall say to him, ‘ יהוה
Elohim of the Heḇrews has met with us. And now, please, let us go three
days’ journey into the wilderness to slaughter to יהוה
our Elohim.’ 
Exod
3:19  “But I know that the sovereign of
Mitsrayim is not going to let you go, not even by a strong hand. 
Exod
3:20  “And I shall stretch out My hand
and smite Mitsrayim with all My wonders which I shall do in its midst. And
after that he shall let you go. 
Exod
3:21  “And I shall give this people
favour in the eyes of the Mitsrites. And it shall be, that when you go, you
shall not go empty-handed.
Exod
3:22  “But every woman shall ask from her
neighbour and from the stranger in her house, objects of silver, and objects of
gold, and garments. And you shall put them on your sons and on your daughters,
and shall plunder the Mitsrites.” 
Exod
4:1  And Mosheh answered and said, “And
if they do not believe me, nor listen to my voice, and say, ‘ יהוה
has not appeared to you?’ ” 
Exod
4:2  And יהוה said
to him, “What is that in your hand?” And he said, “A rod.” 
Exod
4:3  And He said, “Throw it on the
ground.” So he threw it on the ground, and it became a serpent. And Mosheh fled
from it. 
Exod
4:4  And יהוה
said to Mosheh, “Reach out your hand and take it by the tail” – so he reached
out his hand and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand – 
Exod
4:5  so that they believe that יהוה
Elohim of their fathers, the Elohim of Aḇraham, the Elohim of
Yitsḥaq, and the Elohim of Ya‛aqoḇ, has appeared to you.” 
Exod
4:6  And יהוה
said to him again, “Now put your hand in your bosom.” And he put his hand in
his bosom, and when he took it out, and see, his hand was leprous, like snow. 
Exod
4:7  And He said, “Put your hand in your
bosom again.” So he put his hand in his bosom again, and drew it out of his
bosom, and see, it was restored like his other flesh. 
Exod
4:8  “And it shall be, if they do not
believe you, nor listen to the voice of the first sign, they shall believe the
voice of the latter sign. 
Exod
4:9  “And it shall be, if they do not
believe even these two signs, or listen to your voice, that you shall take
water from the river and pour it on the dry land. And the water which you take
from the river shall become blood on the dry land.” 
Exod
4:10  And Mosheh said to יהוה,
“O יהוה, I am not a man of words, neither before nor
since You have spoken to Your servant, for I am slow of speech and slow of
tongue.” 
Exod
4:11  And יהוה
said to him, “Who has made man’s mouth? Or who makes dumb, or deaf, or seeing,
or blind? Is it not I, יהוה ? 
Exod
4:12  “And now, go, and I shall be with
your mouth and teach you what to say.” 
Exod
4:13  But he said, “O יהוה,
please send by the hand of him whom You would send.” 
Exod
4:14  And the displeasure of יהוה
burned against Mosheh, and He said, “Is not Aharon the Lĕwite your
brother? I know that he speaks well. And see, he is also coming out to meet
you. And when he sees you, he shall be glad in his heart. 
Exod
4:15  “And you shall speak to him and put
the words in his mouth. And I am with your mouth and with his mouth, and I
shall teach you what to do. 
Exod
4:16  “And he shall speak for you to the
people. And it shall be that he shall be a mouth for you, and you shall be an
elohim for him.
Exod
4:17  “And take this rod in your hand,
with which you shall do the signs.” 
Exod
4:18  Then Mosheh went and returned to
Yithro his father-in-law, and said to him, “Please let me go and return to my
brothers who are in Mitsrayim to see whether they are still alive.” And Yithro
said to Mosheh, “Go in peace.” 
Exod
4:19  And יהוה
said to Mosheh in Miḏyan, “Go, return to Mitsrayim, for all the men are
dead who sought your life.” 
Exod
4:20  So Mosheh took his wife and his
sons and set them on a donkey, and he returned to the land of Mitsrayim. And
Mosheh took the rod of Elohim in his hand. 
Exod
4:21  And יהוה
said to Mosheh, “As you go back to Mitsrayim, see that you do all those wonders
before Pharaoh which I have put in your hand. But I am going to harden his
heart, so that he does not let the people go. 
Exod
4:22  “And you shall say to Pharaoh, ‘Thus
said יהוה, “Yisra’ĕl is My son, My first-born, 
Exod
4:23  so I say to you, let My son go to
serve Me. But if you refuse to let him go, see, I am killing your son, your
first-born.” ’ ”
Exod
4:24  And it came to be on the way, in
the lodging place, that יהוה met him and sought to kill
him. 
Exod
4:25  And Tsipporah took a sharp stone
and cut off the foreskin of her son and threw it at Mosheh’s feet, and said, “You
are indeed a bridegroom of blood to me!” 
Exod
4:26  So He let him go. Then she said, “You
are a bridegroom of blood,” because of the circumcision. 
Exod
4:27  And יהוה
said to Aharon, “Go to meet Mosheh in the wilderness.” And he went and met him
on the mountain of Elohim, and kissed him. 
Exod
4:28  Mosheh then told Aharon all the
words of יהוה who had sent him, and all the signs which
He had commanded him. 
Exod
4:29  And Mosheh went with Aharon and
gathered together all the elders of the children of Yisra’ĕl. 
Exod
4:30  And Aharon spoke all the words
which יהוה had spoken to Mosheh. Then he did the signs
before the eyes of the people. 
Exod
4:31  And the people believed. And they
heard that יהוה had visited the children of Yisra’ĕl
and that He had looked on their affliction, and they bowed their heads and did
obeisance. 
Exod
5:1  And afterwards Mosheh and Aharon
went in and said to Pharaoh, “Thus said יהוה Elohim of
Yisra’ĕl, ‘Let My people go, so that they keep a festival to Me in the
wilderness.’ ” 
Exod
5:2  And Pharaoh said, “Who is יהוה,
that I should obey His voice to let Yisra’ĕl go? I do not know יהוה,
nor am I going to let Yisra’ĕl go.” 
Exod
5:3  And they said, “The Elohim of the Heḇrews
has met with us. Please, let us go three days’ journey into the wilderness and
slaughter to יהוה our Elohim, lest He fall upon us with
pestilence or with the sword.” 
Exod
5:4  But the sovereign of Mitsrayim said
to them, “Mosheh and Aharon, why do you take the people from their work? Get
back to your burdens.” 
Exod
5:5  And Pharaoh said, “See, the people
of the land are many now, and you make them cease from their burdens!” 
Exod
5:6  And the same day Pharaoh commanded
the slave-drivers of the people and their foremen, saying, 
Exod
5:7  “You are no longer to give the people
straw to make bricks as before. Let them go and gather straw for themselves. 
Exod
5:8  “And lay on them the required amount
of bricks which they made before, do not diminish it. For they are idle, that
is why they cry out, saying, ‘Let us go and slaughter to our Elohim.’ 
Exod
5:9  “Let more work be laid on the men,
so that they labour in it, and not pay attention to words of falsehood.” 
Exod
5:10  And the slave-drivers of the people
and their foremen went out and spoke to the people, saying, “Thus said Pharaoh,
‘I do not give you straw. 
Exod
5:11  ‘Go, take straw for yourselves,
wherever you find it, for your work shall not be diminished.’ ” 
Exod
5:12  And the people were scattered in
all the land of Mitsrayim – to gather stubble for straw. 
Exod
5:13  And the slave-drivers were hurrying
them on, saying, “Complete your work, your daily amount, as when there was
straw.” 
Exod
5:14  Also the foremen of the children of
Yisra’ĕl, whom Pharaoh’s slave-drivers had set over them, were beaten and
were asked, “Why have you not completed your task in making bricks both
yesterday and today, as before?” 
Exod
5:15  And the foremen of the children of
Yisra’ĕl came and cried out to Pharaoh, saying, “Why do you treat your
servants this way? 
Exod
5:16  “There is no straw given to your
servants, and they say to us, ‘Make bricks!’ And see, your servants are beaten,
but your own people are at fault.” 
Exod
5:17  But he said, “You are idle! You are
idle! That is why you say, ‘Let us go and slaughter to יהוה.’

Exod
5:18  “So now go, work. And straw is not
given to you, but deliver the amount of bricks.” 
Exod
5:19  And the foremen of the children of
Yisra’ĕl saw that they were in trouble after it was said, “You are not to
diminish your daily amount of bricks.” 
Exod
5:20  And when they came out from
Pharaoh, they met Mosheh and Aharon who stood there to meet them. 
Exod
5:21  And they said to them, “Let יהוה
look on you and judge, because you have made us loathsome in the eyes of
Pharaoh and in the eyes of his servants, to give a sword in their hand to kill
us.” 
Exod
5:22  And Mosheh returned to יהוה
and said, “ יהוה, why have You done evil to this
people? Why did You send me? 
Exod
5:23  “For ever since I came to Pharaoh
to speak in Your Name, he has done evil to this people. And You have not
delivered Your people at all.” 
Exod
6:1  And יהוה
said to Mosheh, “Now see what I do to Pharaoh, for with a strong hand he is
going to let them go, and with a strong hand he is going to drive them out of
his land.” 
Exod
6:2  And Elohim spoke to Mosheh and said
to him, “I am יהוה. 
Exod
6:3  “And I appeared to Aḇraham, to
Yitsḥaq, and to Ya‛aqoḇ, as Ĕl Shaddai. And by My Name, יהוה,
was I not known to them? 
Exod
6:4  “And I also established My covenant
with them, to give them the land of Kena‛an, the land of their
sojournings, in which they have sojourned. 
Exod
6:5  “And I have also heard the groaning
of the children of Yisra’ĕl whom the Mitsrites are enslaving, and I have
remembered My covenant. 
Exod
6:6  “Say, therefore, to the children of
Yisra’ĕl, ‘I am יהוה, and I shall bring you out
from under the burdens of the Mitsrites, and shall deliver you from their
enslaving, and shall redeem you with an outstretched arm, and with great
judgments, 
Exod
6:7  and shall take you as My people, and
I shall be your Elohim. And you shall know that I am יהוה
your Elohim who is bringing you out from under the burdens of the Mitsrites. 
Exod
6:8  ‘And I shall bring you into the land
which I swore to give to Aḇraham, to Yitsḥaq, and to Ya‛aqoḇ,
to give it to you as an inheritance. I am יהוה.’ ” 
Exod
6:9  And Mosheh spoke thus to the
children of Yisra’ĕl, but they did not listen to Mosheh, because of
shortness of spirit, and from hard slavery. 
Exod
6:10  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying, 
Exod
6:11  “Go in, speak to Pharaoh sovereign
of Mitsrayim, to let the children of Yisra’ĕl go out of his land.” 
Exod
6:12  And Mosheh spoke before יהוה,
saying, “The children of Yisra’ĕl have not listened to me, and why would
Pharaoh listen to me, for I am of uncircumcised lips?” 
Exod
6:13  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh and to Aharon, and gave them a command for the children of
Yisra’ĕl and for Pharaoh, sovereign of Mitsrayim, to bring the children of
Yisra’ĕl out of the land of Mitsrayim. 
Exod
6:14  These are the heads of their
fathers’ houses: The sons of Re’uḇĕn, the first-born of Yisra’ĕl:
Ḥanoḵ and Pallu, Ḥetsron and Karmi. These are the clans of Re’uḇĕn.

Exod
6:15  And the sons of Shim‛on: Yemu’ĕl,
and Yamin, and Ohaḏ, and Yaḵin, and Tsoḥar, and Sha’ul the
son of a Kena‛anite woman. These are the clans of Shim‛on. 
Exod
6:16  These are the names of the sons of
Lĕwi according to their generations: Gĕreshon, and Qehath, and
Merari. And the years of the life of Lĕwi were one hundred and thirty-seven.

Exod
6:17  The sons of Gĕreshon: Liḇni
and Shim‛i according to their clans. 
Exod
6:18  And the sons of Qehath: Amram, and
Yitshar, and Ḥeḇron, and Uzzi’ĕl. And the years of the life of
Qehath were one hundred and thirty-three. 
Exod
6:19  And the sons of Merari: Maḥli
and Mushi. These are the clans of Lĕwi according to their generations. 
Exod
6:20  And Amram took for himself Yoḵeḇeḏ,
his father’s sister, as wife. And she bore him Aharon and Mosheh. And the years
of the life of Amram were one hundred and thirty-seven. 
Exod
6:21  And the sons of Yitshar:
Qoraḥ, and Nepheḡ, and Ziḵri. 
Exod
6:22  And the sons of Uzzi’ĕl: Misha’ĕl,
and Eltsaphan, and Sithri. 
Exod
6:23  Aharon took to himself Elisheḇa,
daughter of Amminaḏaḇ, sister of Naḥshon, as wife. And she
bore him Naḏaḇ, and Aḇihu, El‛azar, and Ithamar. 
Exod
6:24  And the sons of Qoraḥ: Assir,
Elqanah, and Aḇiyasaph. These are the clans of the Qorḥites. 
Exod
6:25  And El‛azar, Aharon’s son,
took for himself one of the daughters of Puti’ĕl as wife. And she bore him
Pineḥas. These are the heads of the fathers of the Lĕwites according
to their clans. 
Exod
6:26  This is Aharon, and Mosheh, to whom
יהוה said, “Bring out the children of Yisra’ĕl
from the land of Mitsrayim according to their divisions.” 
Exod
6:27  They were the ones who spoke to
Pharaoh sovereign of Mitsrayim, to bring out the children of Yisra’ĕl from
Mitsrayim. This is Mosheh, and Aharon. 
Exod
6:28  And it came to be, on the day when יהוה
spoke to Mosheh in the land of Mitsrayim, 
Exod
6:29  that יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying, “I am יהוה. Speak to Pharaoh
sovereign of Mitsrayim all that I say to you.”
Exod
6:30  And Mosheh said before יהוה,
“See, I am of uncircumcised lips, and why would Pharaoh listen to me?” 
Exod
7:1  So יהוה said
to Mosheh, “See, I have made you an elohim to Pharaoh, and Aharon your brother
is your prophet.
Exod
7:2  “You shall speak all that I command
you, and Aharon your brother shall speak to Pharaoh, to let the children of
Yisra’ĕl go out of his land. 
Exod
7:3  “But I am going to harden the heart
of Pharaoh, and shall increase My signs and My wonders in the land of
Mitsrayim. 
Exod
7:4  “And Pharaoh is not going to listen
to you, and I shall lay My hand on Mitsrayim, and bring My divisions and My people,
the children of Yisra’ĕl, out of the land of Mitsrayim by great judgments.

Exod
7:5  “And the Mitsrites shall know that I
am יהוה, when I stretch out My hand on Mitsrayim. And I
shall bring the children of Yisra’ĕl out from among them.” 
Exod
7:6  And Mosheh and Aharon did as יהוה
commanded them, so they did. 
Exod
7:7  Now Mosheh was eighty years old and
Aharon eighty-three years old when they spoke to Pharaoh. 
Exod
7:8  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh and to Aharon, saying, 
Exod
7:9  “When Pharaoh speaks to you, saying,
‘Show a miracle for yourselves,’ then you shall say to Aharon, ‘Take your rod
and throw it before Pharaoh, and let it become a serpent.’ ” 
Exod
7:10  So Mosheh and Aharon went in to
Pharaoh, and they did so, as יהוה commanded. And Aharon
threw his rod before Pharaoh and before his servants, and it became a serpent. 
Exod
7:11  But Pharaoh also called the wise
men and the practisers of witchcraft. And they, the magicians of Mitsrayim,
also did so with their magic. 
Exod
7:12  And they, each one, threw down his
rod, and they became serpents. But the rod of Aharon swallowed up their rods. 
Exod
7:13  And Pharaoh’s heart was hardened,
and he did not listen to them, as יהוה had said. 
Exod
7:14  And יהוה
said to Mosheh, “The heart of Pharaoh is hard, he refuses to let the people go.

Exod
7:15  “Go to Pharaoh in the morning, as
he goes out to the water, and you shall stand by the river’s bank to meet him.
And take in your hand the rod which was turned into a serpent. 
Exod
7:16  “And you shall say to him, ‘ יהוה
the Elohim of the Heḇrews has sent me to you, saying, “Let My people go,
so that they serve Me in the wilderness,” but see, until now you have not
listened! 
Exod
7:17  ‘Thus said יהוה,
“By this you know that I am יהוה. See, I am striking
the waters which are in the river with the rod that is in my hand, and they
shall be turned to blood, 
Exod
7:18  and the fish in the river shall
die. And the river shall stink, and the Mitsrites shall find it impossible to
drink the water of the river.” ’ ” 
Exod
7:19  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, “Say to Aharon, ‘Take your rod and stretch out your hand over
the waters of Mitsrayim, over their streams, over their rivers, over their
ponds, and over all their pools of water, that they become blood. And there shall
be blood in all the land of Mitsrayim, both in wooden and in stone containers.’ ” 
Exod
7:20  And Mosheh and Aharon did so, as יהוה
commanded. And he lifted up the rod and struck the waters that were in the
river, in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of his servants. And all the
waters that were in the river were turned to blood. 
Exod
7:21  And the fish that were in the river
died, and the river stank, and the Mitsrites were unable to drink the water of
the river. And the blood was in all the land of Mitsrayim. 
Exod
7:22  And the magicians of Mitsrayim did
the same with their magic. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did
not listen to them, as יהוה had said. 
Exod
7:23  And Pharaoh turned and went into
his house, and his heart was not moved by this either. 
Exod
7:24  And all the Mitsrites dug all
around the river for water to drink, for they were unable to drink the water of
the river. 
Exod
7:25  And seven days were completed after
יהוה had struck the river. 
Exod
8:1  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, “Go to Pharaoh and say to him, ‘Thus said יהוה,
“Let My people go, so that they serve Me. 
Exod
8:2  “But if you refuse to let them go,
see, I am smiting all your border with frogs.
Exod
8:3  “And the river shall swarm with
frogs, which shall go up and shall come into your house, and into your bedroom,
and on your bed, and into the houses of your servants, and on your people, and
into your ovens, and into your kneading bowls, 
Exod
8:4  and the frogs shall come up on you
and on your people and on all your servants.” ’ ”
Exod
8:5  And יהוה
said to Mosheh, “Say to Aharon, ‘Stretch out your hand with your rod over the
streams, over the rivers, and over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up on the
land of Mitsrayim.’ ” 
Exod
8:6  So Aharon stretched out his hand
over the waters of Mitsrayim, and the frogs came up, and covered the land of
Mitsrayim. 
Exod
8:7  And the magicians did so with their
magic, and brought up frogs on the land of Mitsrayim. 
Exod
8:8  Pharaoh then called for Mosheh and
Aharon, and said, “Pray to יהוה to take away the frogs
from me and from my people, and I shall let the people go to slaughter to יהוה.”

Exod
8:9  And Mosheh said to Pharaoh, “Explain
yourself to me: When am I to pray for you, and for your servants, and for your
people, to destroy the frogs from you and your houses, and remain only in the
river?” 
Exod
8:10  So he said, “Tomorrow.” And he
said, “Let it be according to your word, so that you know that there is no one
like יהוה our Elohim. 
Exod
8:11  “And the frogs shall turn aside
from you, and from your houses, and from your servants, and from your people –
they shall remain in the river only.” 
Exod
8:12  And Mosheh and Aharon went out from
Pharaoh. And Mosheh cried out to יהוה concerning the
frogs which He had brought against Pharaoh. 
Exod
8:13  And יהוה
did according to the word of Mosheh. And the frogs died out of the houses, out
of the courtyards, and out of the fields. 
Exod
8:14  And they gathered them together in
heaps, and the land stank. 
Exod
8:15  And when Pharaoh saw that there was
relief, he hardened his heart and did not listen to them, as יהוה
had said. 
Exod
8:16  And יהוה
said to Mosheh, “Say to Aharon, ‘Stretch out your rod, and strike the dust of
the land, so that it becomes gnats in all the land of Mitsrayim.’ ” 
Exod
8:17  And they did so, and Aharon
stretched out his hand with his rod and struck the dust of the earth, and it
became gnats on man and beast. All the dust of the land became gnats in all the
land of Mitsrayim. 
Exod
8:18  And the magicians did similarly
with their magic to bring forth gnats, but they were unable. And there were
gnats on man and beast. 
Exod
8:19  The magicians then said to Pharaoh,
“This is the finger of Elohim!” But the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he
did not listen to them, as יהוה had said. 
Exod
8:20  And יהוה
said to Mosheh, “Rise early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh as he comes
out to the water, and say to him, ‘Thus said יהוה, “Let
My people go, so that they serve Me. 
Exod
8:21  “Or else, if you do not let My
people go, see, I am sending swarms of flies on you and your servants, and on
your people and into your houses. And the houses of the Mitsrites shall be
filled with swarms of flies, and also the ground on which they stand. 
Exod
8:22  “And in that day I shall separate
the land of Goshen, in which My people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be
there, so that you know that I am יהוה in the midst of
the land. 
Exod
8:23  “And I shall put a distinction
between My people and your people. Tomorrow this sign shall be.” ’ ” 
Exod
8:24  And יהוה
did so, and thick swarms of flies came into the house of Pharaoh, and into his
servants’ houses, and into all the land of Mitsrayim, and the land was ruined
because of the swarms of flies. 
Exod
8:25  Pharaoh then called for Mosheh and
Aharon, and said, “Go, slaughter to your Elohim in the land.” 
Exod
8:26  And Mosheh said, “It is not right
to do so, for we would be slaughtering the abomination of the Mitsrites to יהוה
our Elohim. See, if we slaughter the abomination of the Mitsrites before their
eyes, would they not stone us? 
Exod
8:27  “Let us go three days’ journey into
the wilderness, then we shall slaughter to יהוה our
Elohim, as He commands us.” 
Exod
8:28  And Pharaoh said, “I am letting you
go, then you shall slaughter to יהוה your Elohim in the
wilderness. Only, do not go very far away! Pray for me.” 
Exod
8:29  And Mosheh said, “See, when I leave
you I shall pray to יהוה, and tomorrow the swarms of flies
shall depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people. But do not
let Pharaoh again deceive, not to let the people go to slaughter to יהוה.”

Exod
8:30  And Mosheh went out from Pharaoh
and prayed to יהוה. 
Exod
8:31  And יהוה
did according to the word of Mosheh and removed the swarms of flies from
Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people. Not one remained. 
Exod
8:32  But Pharaoh hardened his heart at
this time too, and did not let the people go. 
Exod
9:1  And יהוה
said to Mosheh, “Go in to Pharaoh and speak to him, ‘Thus said יהוה
Elohim of the Heḇrews, “Let My people go, so that they serve Me. 
Exod
9:2  “For if you refuse to let them go,
and still hold them, 
Exod
9:3  see, the hand of יהוה
is on your livestock in the field, on the horses, on the donkeys, on the
camels, on the cattle, and on the sheep – a very grievous pestilence. 
Exod
9:4  “And יהוה
shall separate between the livestock of Yisra’ĕl and the livestock of
Mitsrayim, and let no matter die of all that belongs to the children of Yisra’ĕl.”
’ ” 
Exod
9:5  And יהוה set
an appointed time, saying, “Tomorrow יהוה is going to
do this word in the land.” 
Exod
9:6  And יהוה did
this word on the next day, and all the livestock of Mitsrayim died, but of the livestock
of the children of Yisra’ĕl, not one died. 
Exod
9:7  Then Pharaoh sent, and see, not even
one of the livestock of the Yisra’ĕlites was dead. But the heart of
Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go. 
Exod
9:8  And יהוה
said to Mosheh and Aharon, “Fill your hands with ashes from a furnace and let
Mosheh scatter it toward the heavens before the eyes of Pharaoh. 
Exod
9:9  “And it shall become fine dust in
all the land of Mitsrayim, and it shall cause boils that break out in sores on man
and beast in all the land of Mitsrayim.” 
Exod
9:10  So they took ashes from the furnace
and stood before Pharaoh, and Mosheh scattered them toward the heavens. And
they caused boils, breaking out in sores on man and beast. 
Exod
9:11  And the magicians were unable to
stand before Mosheh because of the boils, for the boils were on the magicians
and on all the Mitsrites. 
Exod
9:12  But יהוה
hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he did not listen to them, as יהוה
had said to Mosheh. 
Exod
9:13  And יהוה
said to Mosheh, “Rise early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh, and say to
him, ‘Thus said יהוה Elohim of the Heḇrews, “Let
My people go, so that they serve Me, 
Exod
9:14  for at this time I am sending all
My plagues unto your heart, and on your servants and on your people, so that
you know that there is no one like Me in all the earth. 
Exod
9:15  “Now if I had stretched out My hand
and struck you and your people with pestilence, then you would have been cut
off from the earth. 
Exod
9:16  “And for this reason I have raised
you up, in order to show you My power, and in order to declare My Name in all
the earth. 
Exod
9:17  “You still exalt yourself against
My people in that you do not let them go! 
Exod
9:18  “See, tomorrow about this time I am
causing very heavy hail to rain down, such as has not been in Mitsrayim, from
the day of its founding until now. 
Exod
9:19  “And now send, bring your livestock
to safety, and all that you have in the field, for the hail shall come down on
every man and every beast which is found in the field and is not brought home,
and they shall die.” ’ ”
Exod
9:20  Those among the servants of Pharaoh
who feared the word of יהוה made their servants and
livestock flee to the houses. 
Exod
9:21  But those who did not set their
heart on the word of יהוה left their servants and
livestock in the field.
Exod
9:22  Then יהוה
said to Mosheh, “Stretch out your hand toward the heavens, and let there be
hail in all the land of Mitsrayim – on man, and on beast, and on every plant of
the field, throughout the land of Mitsrayim.” 
Exod
9:23  Then Mosheh stretched out his rod
toward the heavens. And יהוה sent thunder and hail, and
fire came down to the earth. And יהוה rained hail on
the land of Mitsrayim. 
Exod
9:24  Thus there came to be hail, and
fire flashing continually in the midst of the hail, very heavy, such as had not
been in all the land of Mitsrayim since it became a nation. 
Exod
9:25  And the hail smote in all the land
of Mitsrayim all that was in the field, both man and beast. And the hail smote
every plant of the field and broke every tree of the field. 
Exod
9:26  Only in the land of Goshen, where
the children of Yisra’ĕl were, there was no hail. 
Exod
9:27  Pharaoh then sent and called for
Mosheh and for Aharon, and said to them, “I have sinned this time. יהוה
is righteous, and my people and I are wrong. 
Exod
9:28  “Pray to יהוה,
for there has been enough of the thunder and hail of Elohim. And I am letting
you go, so that you stay no longer.” 
Exod
9:29  And Mosheh said to him, “As soon as
I go out of the city, let me spread out my hands to יהוה,
let the thunder cease and the hail be no more, so that you know that the earth
belongs to יהוה. 
Exod
9:30  “But as for you and your servants,
I know that you do not yet fear before יהוה Elohim.”
Exod
9:31  And the flax and the barley were
smitten, for the barley was in the head and the flax was in bud. 
Exod
9:32  But the wheat and the spelt were
not smitten, for they were late crops. 
Exod
9:33  And Mosheh went out of the city
from Pharaoh and spread out his hands to יהוה, and the
thunder and the hail ceased, and the rain was not poured on the earth. 
Exod
9:34  And Pharaoh saw that the rain, and
the hail, and the thunder had ceased, yet he sinned again and he hardened his
heart, he and his servants. 
Exod
9:35  And the heart of Pharaoh was
hardened, and he did not let the children of Yisra’ĕl go, as יהוה
had said through Mosheh. 
Exod
10:1  And יהוה
said to Mosheh, “Go in to Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart and the hearts
of his servants, so that I show these signs of Mine before him, 
Exod
10:2  and that you relate in the hearing
of your son and your son’s son what I have done in Mitsrayim, and My signs
which I have done among them. And you shall know that I am יהוה.”

Exod
10:3  And Mosheh and Aharon came in to
Pharaoh and said to him, “Thus said יהוה Elohim of the
Heḇrews, ‘Till when shall you refuse to humble yourself before Me? Let My
people go, so that they serve Me. 
Exod
10:4  ‘Or else, if you refuse to let My
people go, see, tomorrow I am bringing locusts within your borders. 
Exod
10:5  ‘And they shall cover the surface
of the land, so that no one is able to see the land. And they shall eat the
rest of what has escaped, which remains to you from the hail, and they shall
eat every tree which grows up for you out of the field. 
Exod
10:6  ‘And they shall fill your houses,
and the houses of all your servants, and the houses of all the Mitsrites, which
neither your fathers nor your fathers’ fathers have seen, since the day that
they were on the earth to this day.’ ” Then he turned and went out from
Pharaoh. 
Exod
10:7  And Pharaoh’s servants said to him,
“Till when would this one be a snare to us? Let the men go, so that they serve יהוה
their Elohim. Do you not yet know that Mitsrayim is destroyed?” 
Exod
10:8  And Mosheh and Aharon were brought
back to Pharaoh, and he said to them, “Go, serve יהוה
your Elohim. Who are the ones that are going?” 
Exod
10:9  And Mosheh said, “We are going with
our young and our old, with our sons and our daughters, with our flocks and our
herds we are going, for we have a festival to יהוה.” 
Exod
10:10  And he said to them, “Let יהוה
be with you as I let you and your little ones go! Watch, for evil is before
your face! 
Exod
10:11  “Not so! You men go now, and serve
יהוה, for that is what you desired.” And they were
driven out from the presence of Pharaoh. 
Exod
10:12  And יהוה
said to Mosheh, “Stretch out your hand over the land of Mitsrayim for the
locusts to come upon the land of Mitsrayim, and eat every plant of the land –
all that the hail has left.” 
Exod
10:13  And Mosheh stretched out his rod
over the land of Mitsrayim, and יהוה brought an east
wind on the land all that day and all that night. Morning came, and the east
wind brought the locusts. 
Exod
10:14  And the locusts went up over all
the land of Mitsrayim and settled within all the borders of Mitsrayim, very
grievous. There had never been locusts like them before, nor would there again
be like them. 
Exod
10:15  And they covered the surface of
all the land, so that the land was darkened. And they ate every plant of the
land and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left, and no greenness
was left on the trees or on the plants of the field, in all the land of
Mitsrayim. 
Exod
10:16  Pharaoh then called for Mosheh and
Aharon in haste, and said, “I have sinned against יהוה
your Elohim and against you. 
Exod
10:17  “And now, please forgive my sin
only this once, and pray to יהוה your Elohim, that He
would only turn away this death from me.” 
Exod
10:18  And he went out from Pharaoh and
prayed to יהוה. 
Exod
10:19  And יהוה
turned a very strong west wind, which took the locusts away and blew them into
the Sea of Reeds. Not one locust was left within all the border of Mitsrayim.
Exod
10:20  However, יהוה
hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he did not let the children of Yisra’ĕl
go. 
Exod
10:21  And יהוה
said to Mosheh, “Stretch out your hand toward the heavens, and let there be
darkness over the land of Mitsrayim, even a darkness which is felt.” 
Exod
10:22  And Mosheh stretched out his hand
toward the heavens, and there was thick darkness in all the land of Mitsrayim
for three days. 
Exod
10:23  They did not see one another, nor
did anyone rise from his place for three days, while all the children of Yisra’ĕl
had light in their dwellings. 
Exod
10:24  And Pharaoh called to Mosheh and
said, “Go, serve יהוה, only leave your flocks and your
herds behind. Let your little ones go with you too.” 
Exod
10:25  But Mosheh said, “You yourself are
to provide us with slaughterings and burnt offerings, to prepare for יהוה
our Elohim. 
Exod
10:26  “And our livestock are to go with
us too, not a hoof is to be left behind, for we have to take some of them to
serve יהוה our Elohim, and we ourselves do not know
with what we are to serve יהוה until we come there.” 
Exod
10:27  However, יהוה
hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he would not let them go. 
Exod
10:28  And Pharaoh said to him, “Get away
from me! Watch yourself and see my face no more, for in the day you see my face
you die!” 
Exod
10:29  And Mosheh said, “You have spoken
rightly – never again do I see your face!” 
Exod
11:1  And יהוה
said to Mosheh, “I am bringing yet one more plague on Pharaoh and on Mitsrayim.
After that he is going to let you go from here. When he lets you go, he shall
drive you out from here altogether. 
Exod
11:2  “Speak now in the hearing of the
people, and let every man ask from his neighbour and every woman from her
neighbour, objects of silver and objects of gold.” 
Exod
11:3  And יהוה
gave the people favour in the eyes of the Mitsrites. And the man Mosheh was
very great in the land of Mitsrayim, in the eyes of Pharaoh’s servants and in
the eyes of the people. 
Exod
11:4  And Mosheh said, “Thus said יהוה,
‘About midnight I am going out into the midst of Mitsrayim, 
Exod
11:5  and all the first-born in the land
of Mitsrayim shall die, from the first-born of Pharaoh who sits on his throne,
even to the first-born of the female servant who is behind the handmill, and
all the first-born of cattle. 
Exod
11:6  ‘And there shall be a great cry
throughout all the land of Mitsrayim, such as has never been or ever be again. 
Exod
11:7  ‘But against any of the children of
Yisra’ĕl no dog shall move its tongue, against man or against beast, so
that you know that יהוה makes distinction between
Mitsrayim and Yisra’ĕl.’ 
Exod
11:8  “And all these servants of yours
shall come down to me and bow down to me, saying, ‘Get out, you and all the
people at your feet!’ And after that I shall go out.” And he went out from
Pharaoh in great displeasure. 
Exod
11:9  But יהוה
said to Mosheh, “Pharaoh is not going to listen to you, in order to multiply My
wonders in the land of Mitsrayim.” 
Exod
11:10  And Mosheh and Aharon did all
these wonders before Pharaoh, however, יהוה hardened
the heart of Pharaoh, and he did not let the children of Yisra’ĕl go out
of his land. 
Exod
12:1  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh and to Aharon in the land of Mitsrayim, saying, 
Exod
12:2  “This month is the beginning of
months for you, it is the first month of the year for you. 
Exod
12:3  “Speak to all the congregation of
Yisra’ĕl, saying, ‘On the tenth day of this month each one of them is to
take for himself a lamb, according to the house of his father, a lamb for a
household. 
Exod
12:4  ‘And if the household is too small
for the lamb, let him and his neighbour next to his house take it according to
the number of the beings, according to each man’s need you make your count for
the lamb. 
Exod
12:5  ‘Let the lamb be a perfect one, a
year old male. Take it from the sheep or from the goats. 
Exod
12:6  ‘And you shall keep it until the
fourteenth day of the same month. Then all the assembly of the congregation of
Yisra’ĕl shall kill it between the evenings. 
Exod
12:7  ‘And they shall take some of the
blood and put it on the two doorposts and on the lintel of the houses where
they eat it. 
Exod
12:8  ‘And they shall eat the flesh on
that night, roasted in fire – with unleavened bread and with bitter herbs they
shall eat it.
Exod
12:9  ‘Do not eat it raw, nor boiled at
all with water, but roasted in fire, its head with its legs and its inward
parts. 
Exod
12:10  ‘And do not leave of it until
morning, and what remains of it until morning you are to burn with fire. 
Exod
12:11  ‘And this is how you eat it: your
loins girded, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand. And you
shall eat it in haste. It is the Passover of יהוה. 
Exod
12:12  ‘And I shall pass through the land
of Mitsrayim on that night, and shall smite all the first-born in the land of
Mitsrayim, both man and beast. And on all the mighty ones of Mitsrayim I shall
execute judgment. I am יהוה. 
Exod
12:13  ‘And the blood shall be a sign for
you on the houses where you are. And when I see the blood, I shall pass over
you, and let the plague not come on you to destroy you when I smite the land of
Mitsrayim. 
Exod
12:14  ‘And this day shall become to you
a remembrance. And you shall observe it as a festival to יהוה
throughout your generations – observe it as a festival, an everlasting law.
Exod
12:15  ‘Seven days you shall eat
unleavened bread. Indeed on the first day you cause leaven to cease from your
houses. For whoever eats leavened bread from the first day until the seventh
day, that being shall be cut off from Yisra’ĕl. 
Exod
12:16  ‘And on the first day is a
set-apart gathering, and on the seventh day you have a set-apart gathering. No
work at all is done on them, only that which is eaten by every being, that alone
is prepared by you. 
Exod
12:17  ‘And you shall guard the Festival of Unleavened Bread, for on
this same day I brought your divisions out of the land of Mitsrayim. And you
shall guard this day throughout your generations, an everlasting law. 
Exod
12:18  ‘In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, in the evening, you
shall eat unleavened bread until the twenty-first day of the month in the
evening. 
Exod
12:19  ‘For seven days no leaven is to be
found in your houses, for if anyone eats what is leavened, that same being
shall be cut off from the congregation of Yisra’ĕl, whether sojourner or
native of the land. 
Exod
12:20  ‘Do not eat that which is leavened
– in all your dwellings you are to eat unleavened bread.’ ” 
Exod
12:21  And Mosheh called for all the
elders of Yisra’ĕl and said to them, “Go out and take lambs for yourselves
according to your clans, and slaughter the Passover lamb. 
Exod
12:22  “And you shall take a bunch of
hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and strike the lintel and
the two doorposts with the blood that is in the basin, and you, none of you
shall go out of the door of his house until morning. 
Exod
12:23  “And יהוה
shall pass on to smite the Mitsrites, and shall see the blood on the lintel and
on the two doorposts, and יהוה shall pass over the door
and not allow the destroyer to come into your houses to smite you. 
Exod
12:24  “And you shall guard this word as
a law for you and your sons, forever. 
Exod
12:25  “And it shall be, when you come to
the land which יהוה gives you, as He promised, that you
shall guard this service. 
Exod
12:26  “And it shall be, when your
children say to you, ‘What does this service mean to you?’ 
Exod
12:27  then you shall say, ‘It is the
Passover slaughtering of יהוה, who passed over the
houses of the children of Yisra’ĕl in Mitsrayim when He smote the
Mitsrites and delivered our households.’ ” And the people bowed their heads and
did obeisance. 
Exod
12:28  And the children of Yisra’ĕl
went away and did so – as יהוה had commanded Mosheh and
Aharon, so they did. 
Exod
12:29  And it came to be at midnight that
יהוה smote all the first-born in the land of Mitsrayim,
from the first-born of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the first-born of the
captive who was in the dungeon, and all the first-born of livestock. 
Exod
12:30  And Pharaoh rose up in the night,
he and all his servants, and all the Mitsrites. And there was a great cry in
Mitsrayim, for there was not a house where there was not a dead one. 
Exod
12:31  Then he called for Mosheh and
Aharon by night, and said, “Arise, go out from the midst of my people, both you
and the children of Yisra’ĕl. And go, serve יהוה
as you have said. 
Exod
12:32  “Take both your flocks and your
herds, as you have said, and go. Then you shall bless me too.” 
Exod
12:33  And the Mitsrites urged the
people, to hasten to send them away out of the land. For they said, “We are all
dying!” 
Exod
12:34  And the people took their dough
before it was leavened, having their kneading bowls bound up in their garments
on their shoulders. 
Exod
12:35  And the children of Yisra’ĕl
had done according to the word of Mosheh, and they had asked from the Mitsrites
objects of silver, and objects of gold, and garments. 
Exod
12:36  And יהוה
gave the people favour in the eyes of the Mitsrites, so that they gave them
what they asked, and they plundered the Mitsrites. 
Exod
12:37  And the children of Yisra’ĕl
set out from Ra‛meses to Sukkoth, about six hundred thousand men on foot,
besides the little ones. 
Exod
12:38  And a mixed multitude went up with
them too, also flocks and herds, very much livestock. 
Exod
12:39  And they baked unleavened cakes of
the dough which they had brought out of Mitsrayim, for it was not leavened,
since they were driven out of Mitsrayim, and had not been able to delay, nor
had they prepared food for themselves. 
Exod
12:40  And the sojourn of the children of
Yisra’ĕl who lived in Mitsrayim was four hundred and thirty years. 
Exod
12:41  And it came to be at the end of
the four hundred and thirty years, on that same day it came to be that all the
divisions of יהוה went out from the land of Mitsrayim. 
Exod
12:42  It is a night to be observed unto יהוה
for bringing them out of the land of Mitsrayim. This night is unto יהוה,
to be observed by all the children of Yisra’ĕl throughout their
generations. 
Exod
12:43  And יהוה
said to Mosheh and Aharon, “This is the law of the Passover: No son of a
stranger is to eat of it, 
Exod
12:44  but any servant a man has bought
for silver, when you have circumcised him, then let him eat of it. 
Exod
12:45  “A sojourner and a hired servant
does not eat of it. 
Exod
12:46  “It is eaten in one house, you are
not to take any of the flesh outside the house, nor are you to break any bone
of it. 
Exod
12:47  “All the congregation of Yisra’ĕl
are to perform it. 
Exod
12:48  “And when a stranger sojourns with
you and shall perform the Passover to יהוה, let all his
males be circumcised, and then let him come near and perform it, and he shall
be as a native of the land. But let no uncircumcised eat of it. 
Exod
12:49  “There is one Torah for the
native-born and for the stranger who sojourns among you.” 
Exod
12:50  And all the children of Yisra’ĕl
did as יהוה commanded Mosheh and Aharon, so they did. 
Exod
12:51  And it came to be on that same day
that יהוה brought the children of Yisra’ĕl out of
the land of Mitsrayim according to their divisions. 
Exod
13:1  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying,
Exod
13:2  “Set apart to Me all the
first-born, the one opening the womb among the children of Yisra’ĕl, among
man and among beast, it is Mine.” 
Exod
13:3  And Mosheh said to the people, “Remember
this day in which you went out of Mitsrayim, out of the house of slavery. For
by strength of hand יהוה brought you out of this place,
and whatever is leavened shall not be eaten. 
Exod
13:4  “Today you are going out, in the
month Aḇiḇ. 
Exod
13:5  “And it shall be, when יהוה
brings you into the land of the Kena‛anites, and the Ḥittites, and
the Amorites, and the Ḥiwwites, and the Yeḇusites, which He swore
to your fathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, that you shall
keep this service in this month. 
Exod
13:6  “Seven days you eat unleavened
bread, and on the seventh day is a festival to יהוה. 
Exod
13:7  “Unleavened bread is to be eaten
the seven days, and whatever is leavened is not to be seen with you, and leaven
is not to be seen with you within all your border. 
Exod
13:8  “And you shall inform your son in
that day, saying, ‘It is because of what יהוה did for
me when I came up from Mitsrayim.’ 
Exod
13:9  “And it shall be as a sign to you
on your hand and as a reminder between your eyes, that the Torah of יהוה
is to be in your mouth, for with a strong hand יהוה has
brought you out of Mitsrayim. 
Exod
13:10  “And you shall guard this law at
its appointed time from year to year. 
Exod
13:11  “And it shall be, when יהוה
brings you into the land of the Kena‛anites, as He swore to you and your
fathers, and gives it to you,
Exod
13:12  that you shall pass over to יהוה
every one opening the womb, and every first-born that comes from your
livestock, the males belong to יהוה. 
Exod
13:13  “But every first-born of a donkey
you are to ransom with a lamb. And if you do not ransom it, then you shall
break its neck. And every first-born of man among your sons you are to ransom. 
Exod
13:14  “And it shall be, when your son
asks you in time to come, saying, ‘What is this?’ then you shall say to him, ‘By
strength of hand יהוה brought us out of Mitsrayim, out
of the house of bondage. 
Exod
13:15  ‘And it came to be, when Pharaoh
was too hardened to let us go, that יהוה killed every
first-born in the land of Mitsrayim, both the first-born of man and the
first-born of beast. Therefore I am slaughtering to יהוה
every male that open the womb, but every first-born of my sons I ransom.’ 
Exod
13:16  “And it shall be as a sign on your
hand and as frontlets between your eyes, for by strength of hand יהוה
brought us out of Mitsrayim.” 
Exod
13:17  And it came to be, when Pharaoh
had let the people go, that Elohim did not lead them by way of the land of the
Philistines, though that was nearer, for Elohim said, “Lest the people regret
when they see fighting, and return to Mitsrayim.” 
Exod
13:18  So Elohim led the people around by
way of the wilderness of the Sea of Reeds. And the children of Yisra’ĕl
went up armed from the land of Mitsrayim. 
Exod
13:19  And Mosheh took the bones of Yosĕph
with him, for he certainly made the children of Yisra’ĕl swear, saying, “Elohim
shall certainly visit you, and you shall bring my bones from here with you.” 
Exod
13:20  And they departed from Sukkoth and
camped in Ĕtham at the edge of the wilderness. 
Exod
13:21  And יהוה
went before them by day in a column of cloud to lead the way, and by night in a
column of fire to give them light, so as to go by day and night. 
Exod
13:22  The column of cloud did not cease
by day, nor the column of fire by night, before the people. 
Exod
14:1  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying,
Exod
14:2  “Speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl,
that they turn and camp before Pi Haḥiroth, between Miḡdol and the
sea, opposite Ba‛al Tsephon – camp before it by the sea. 
Exod
14:3  “For Pharaoh shall say of the
children of Yisra’ĕl, ‘They are entangled in the land, the wilderness has
closed them in.’ 
Exod
14:4  “And I shall harden the heart of
Pharaoh, and he shall pursue them. But I am to be esteemed through Pharaoh and
over all his army, and the Mitsrites shall know that I am יהוה.”
And they did so. 
Exod
14:5  And it was reported to the
sovereign of Mitsrayim that the people had fled, and the heart of Pharaoh and
his servants was turned against the people. And they said, “Why have we done
this, that we have let Yisra’ĕl go from serving us?” 
Exod
14:6  So he made his chariot ready and
took his people with him. 
Exod
14:7  And he took six hundred choice
chariots, and all the chariots of Mitsrayim with officers over all of them. 
Exod
14:8  And יהוה
hardened the heart of Pharaoh sovereign of Mitsrayim, and he pursued the
children of Yisra’ĕl, but the children of Yisra’ĕl went out
defiantly. 
Exod
14:9  And the Mitsrites pursued them, and
all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen and his army, and
overtook them camping by the sea beside Pi Haḥiroth, before Ba‛al
Tsephon. 
Exod
14:10  And when Pharaoh drew near, the
children of Yisra’ĕl lifted their eyes and saw the Mitsrites coming up
after them. And they were greatly afraid, so the children of Yisra’ĕl
cried out to יהוה. 
Exod
14:11  And they said to Mosheh, “Did you
take us away to die in the wilderness because there are no graves in Mitsrayim?
What is this you have done to us, to bring us up out of Mitsrayim? 
Exod
14:12  “Is this not the word that we
spoke to you in Mitsrayim, saying, ‘Leave us alone and let us serve the
Mitsrites?’ For it would have been better for us to serve the Mitsrites than to
die in the wilderness.” 
Exod
14:13  And Mosheh said to the people, “Do
not be afraid. Stand still, and see the deliverance of יהוה,
which He does for you today. For the Mitsrites whom you see today, you are
never, never to see again. 
Exod
14:14  “ יהוה
does fight for you, and you keep still.” 
Exod
14:15  And יהוה
said to Mosheh, “Why do you cry to Me? Speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl,
and let them go forward. 
Exod
14:16  “And you, lift up your rod, and
stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it, and let the children of Yisra’ĕl
go on dry ground through the midst of the sea. 
Exod
14:17  “And I, see I am hardening the hearts
of the Mitsrites, and they shall follow them. And I am to be esteemed through
Pharaoh and over all his army, his chariots, and his horsemen. 
Exod
14:18  “And the Mitsrites shall know that
I am יהוה, when I am esteemed through Pharaoh, his
chariots, and his horsemen.” 
Exod
14:19  And the Messenger of Elohim, who
went before the camp of Yisra’ĕl, moved and went behind them. And the
column of cloud went from before them and stood behind them, 
Exod
14:20  and came between the camp of the
Mitsrites and the camp of Yisra’ĕl. And it was the cloud and the darkness,
and it gave light by night, and the one did not come near the other all the
night. 
Exod
14:21  And Mosheh stretched out his hand
over the sea. And יהוה caused the sea to go back by a
strong east wind all that night, and made the sea into dry land, and the waters
were divided. 
Exod
14:22  And the children of Yisra’ĕl
went into the midst of the sea on dry ground, and the waters were a wall to
them on their right and on their left. 
Exod
14:23  And the Mitsrites pursued and went
after them into the midst of the sea, all the horses of Pharaoh, his chariots,
and his horsemen. 
Exod
14:24  And it came to be, in the morning
watch, that יהוה looked down upon the army of the
Mitsrites through the column of fire and cloud, and He brought the army of the
Mitsrites into confusion. 
Exod
14:25  And He took off their chariot
wheels, so that they drove them with difficulty. And the Mitsrites said, “Let
us flee from the face of Yisra’ĕl, for יהוה fights
for them against the Mitsrites.” 
Exod
14:26  Then יהוה
said to Mosheh, “Stretch out your hand over the sea, and let the waters come
back upon the Mitsrites, on their chariots, and on their horsemen.” 
Exod
14:27  And Mosheh stretched out his hand
over the sea, and the sea returned to its usual flow, at the break of day, with
the Mitsrites fleeing into it. Thus יהוה overthrew the
Mitsrites in the midst of the sea, 
Exod
14:28  and the waters returned and
covered the chariots, and the horsemen, and all the army of Pharaoh that came
into the sea after them, and not even one was left of them. 
Exod
14:29  And the children of Yisra’ĕl
walked on dry ground in the midst of the sea, and the waters were a wall to
them on their right and on their left. 
Exod
14:30  Thus יהוה
saved Yisra’ĕl that day out of the hand of the Mitsrites, and Yisra’ĕl
saw the Mitsrites dead on the seashore. 
Exod
14:31  And Yisra’ĕl saw the great
work which יהוה had done in Mitsrayim, and the people
feared יהוה, and believed יהוה
and His servant Mosheh.
Exod
15:1  Then Mosheh and the children of
Yisra’ĕl sang this song to יהוה, and spoke,
saying, “I sing to יהוה, for He is highly exalted! The
horse and its rider He has thrown into the sea! 
Exod
15:2  “Yah is my strength and song, and
He has become my deliverance. He is my Ĕl, and I praise Him – Elohim of my
father, and I exalt Him. 
Exod
15:3  “ יהוה is a
man of battle, יהוה is His Name. 
Exod
15:4  “He has cast Pharaoh’s chariots and
his army into the sea, and his chosen officers are drowned in the Sea of Reeds.

Exod
15:5  “The depths covered them, they went
down to the bottom like a stone. 
Exod
15:6  “Your right hand, O יהוה,
has become great in power. Your right hand, O יהוה, has
crushed the enemy. 
Exod
15:7  “And in the greatness of Your
excellence You pulled down those who rose up against You. You sent forth Your
wrath, it consumed them like stubble. 
Exod
15:8  “And with the wind of Your nostrils
the waters were heaped up, the floods stood like a wall, the depths became
stiff in the heart of the sea. 
Exod
15:9  “The enemy said, ‘I pursue, I
overtake, I divide the spoil, my being is satisfied on them. I draw out my
sword, my hand destroys them.’ 
Exod
15:10  “You did blow with Your wind, the
sea covered them, they sank like lead in the mighty waters. 
Exod
15:11  “Who is like You, O יהוה,
among the mighty ones? Who is like You, great in set-apartness, awesome in
praises, working wonders? 
Exod
15:12  “You stretched out Your right
hand, the earth swallowed them. 
Exod
15:13  “In Your kindness You led the
people whom You have redeemed, in Your strength You guided them to Your
set-apart dwelling. 
Exod
15:14  “Peoples heard, they trembled,
anguish gripped the inhabitants of Philistia. 
Exod
15:15  “Then the chiefs of Eḏom
were troubled, the mighty men of Mo’aḇ, trembling grips them, all the
inhabitants of Kena‛an melted.
Exod
15:16  “Fear and dread fell on them, by
the greatness of Your arm they are as silent as a stone, until Your people pass
over, O יהוה, until the people, whom You have bought,
pass over. 
Exod
15:17  “You bring them in and plant them
in the mountain of Your inheritance, in the place, O יהוה,
which You have made for Your own dwelling, the set-apart place, O יהוה,
which Your hands have prepared. 
Exod
15:18  “ יהוה
reigns forever and ever.” 
Exod
15:19  For the horses of Pharaoh went
with his chariots and his horsemen into the sea, and יהוה
brought back the waters of the sea upon them. And the children of Yisra’ĕl
went on dry ground in the midst of the sea. 
Exod
15:20  And Miryam the prophetess, the
sister of Aharon, took the timbrel in her hand. And all the women went out
after her with timbrels and with dances. 
Exod
15:21  And Miryam answered them, “Sing to
יהוה, for He is highly exalted! The horse and its rider
He has thrown into the sea!” 
Exod
15:22  And Mosheh brought Yisra’ĕl
from the Sea of Reeds, and they went out into the Wilderness of Shur. And they
went three days in the wilderness and found no water. 
Exod
15:23  And they came to Marah, and they
were unable to drink the waters of Marah, for they were bitter. So the name of
it was called Marah. 
Exod
15:24  And the people grumbled against
Mosheh, saying, “What are we to drink?” 
Exod
15:25  Then he cried out to יהוה,
and יהוה showed him a tree. And when he threw it into
the waters, the waters were made sweet. There He made a law and a right-ruling
for them, and there He tried them. 
Exod
15:26  And He said, “If you diligently
obey the voice of יהוה your Elohim and do what is right
in His eyes, and shall listen to His commands and shall guard all His laws, I
shall bring on you none of the diseases I brought on the Mitsrites, for I am יהוה
who heals you.” 
Exod
15:27  And they came to Ĕlim, where
there were twelve fountains of water and seventy palm trees. And they camped
there by the waters. 
Exod
16:1  And they set out from Ĕlim,
and all the congregation of the children of Yisra’ĕl came to the
Wilderness of Sin, which is between Ĕlim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day
of the second month after their going out of the land of Mitsrayim. 
Exod
16:2  And all the congregation of the
children of Yisra’ĕl grumbled against Mosheh and Aharon in the wilderness.

Exod
16:3  And the children of Yisra’ĕl
said to them, “If only we had died by the hand of יהוה
in the land of Mitsrayim, when we sat by the pots of meat and when we ate bread
to satisfaction! For you have brought us out into this wilderness to put all
this assembly to death with hunger.” 
Exod
16:4  And יהוה
said to Mosheh, “See, I am raining bread from the heavens for you. And the
people shall go out and gather a day’s portion every day, in order to try them,
whether they walk in My Torah or not. 
Exod
16:5  “And it shall be on the sixth day
that they shall prepare what they bring in, and it shall be twice as much as
they gather daily.” 
Exod
16:6  And Mosheh and Aharon said to all
the children of Yisra’ĕl, “At evening you shall know that יהוה
has brought you out of the land of Mitsrayim. 
Exod
16:7  “And in the morning you shall see
the esteem of יהוה, for He hears your grumblings
against יהוה. And what are we, that you grumble against
us?” 
Exod
16:8  And Mosheh said, “In that יהוה
gives you meat to eat in the evening, and in the morning bread to satisfaction,
for יהוה hears your grumblings which you make against
Him. And what are we? Your grumblings are not against us but against יהוה.”

Exod
16:9  And Mosheh said to Aharon, “Say to
all the congregation of the children of Yisra’ĕl, ‘Come near before יהוה,
for He has heard your grumblings.’ ” 
Exod
16:10  And it came to be, as Aharon spoke
to all the congregation of the children of Yisra’ĕl, that they looked
toward the wilderness and see, the esteem of יהוה
appeared in the cloud. 
Exod
16:11  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying, 
Exod
16:12  “I have heard the grumblings of
the children of Yisra’ĕl. Speak to them, saying, ‘Between the evenings you
are to eat meat, and in the morning you are to be satisfied with bread. And you
shall know that I am יהוה your Elohim.’ ” 
Exod
16:13  And it came to be that quails came
up at evening and covered the camp, and in the morning the dew lay all around
the camp. 
Exod
16:14  And the layer of dew went up, and
see, on the surface of the wilderness, was a small round substance, as fine as
frost on the ground. 
Exod
16:15  And the children of Yisra’ĕl
saw, and they said to each other, “What is it?” For they did not know what it
was. And Mosheh said to them, “It is the bread which יהוה
has given you to eat. 
Exod
16:16  “This is the word which יהוה
has commanded: ‘Let every man gather it according to each one’s need, an omer
for each being, according to the number of beings. Let every man take for those
who are in his tent.’ ” 
Exod
16:17  And the children of Yisra’ĕl
did so and gathered, some more, some less. 
Exod
16:18  And they measured it by omers, and
he who gathered much did not have too much, and he who gathered little did not
have too little. Each one gathered according to his need. 
Exod
16:19  And Mosheh said, “Let no one leave
any of it until morning.” 
Exod
16:20  And they did not listen to Mosheh,
so some of them left part of it until morning, and it bred worms and stank. And
Mosheh was wroth with them. 
Exod
16:21  And they gathered it every
morning, each one according to his need. And when the sun became hot, it
melted. 
Exod
16:22  And it came to be, on the sixth
day, that they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one. And all
the rulers of the congregation came and told Mosheh. 
Exod
16:23  And he said to them, “This is what
יהוה has said, ‘Tomorrow is a rest, a Sabbath set-apart
to יהוה. That which you bake, bake; and that which you
cook, cook. And lay up for yourselves all that is left over, to keep it until
morning.’ ” 
Exod
16:24  And they laid it up till morning,
as Mosheh commanded. And it did not stink, and no worm was in it. 
Exod
16:25  And Mosheh said, “Eat it today,
for today is a Sabbath to יהוה, today you do not find
it in the field. 
Exod
16:26  “Gather it six days, but on the
seventh day, which is the Sabbath, there is none.” 
Exod
16:27  And it came to be that some of the
people went out on the seventh day to gather, but they found none. 
Exod
16:28  And יהוה
said to Mosheh, “How long shall you refuse to guard My commands and My Torot?
Exod
16:29  “See, because יהוה
has given you the Sabbath, therefore He is giving you bread for two days on the
sixth day. Let each one stay in his place, do not let anyone go out of his
place on the seventh day.” 
Exod
16:30  So the people rested on the
seventh day.
Exod
16:31  And the house of Yisra’ĕl
called its name Manna. And it was like white coriander seed, and the taste of
it was like thin cakes made with honey. 
Exod
16:32  And Mosheh said, “This is the word
which יהוה has commanded: ‘Fill an omer with it, to
keep for your generations, so that they see the bread with which I fed you in
the wilderness, when I brought you out of the land of Mitsrayim.’ ” 
Exod
16:33  And Mosheh said to Aharon, “Take a
pot and put an omer of manna in it, and set it down before יהוה,
to keep for your generations.”
Exod
16:34  As יהוה
commanded Mosheh, so did Aharon set it down before the Witness, to keep. 
Exod
16:35  And the children of Yisra’ĕl
ate manna forty years, until they came to an inhabited land. They ate manna
until they came to the border of the land of Kena‛an. 
Exod
16:36  And an omer is one-tenth of an ĕphah.

Exod
17:1  And all the congregation of the
children of Yisra’ĕl set out on their journey from the Wilderness of Sin,
according to the command of יהוה, and camped in Rephiḏim.
And there was no water for the people to drink. 
Exod
17:2  Therefore the people strove with
Mosheh, and said, “Give us water to drink.” And Mosheh said to them, “Why do
you strive with me? Why do you try יהוה ?” 
Exod
17:3  And the people thirsted there for
water, and the people grumbled against Mosheh, and said, “Why did you bring us
out of Mitsrayim, to kill us and our children and our livestock with thirst?” 
Exod
17:4  Then Mosheh cried out to יהוה,
saying, “What am I to do with this people? Yet a little and they shall stone
me!” 
Exod
17:5  And יהוה
said to Mosheh, “Pass over before the people, and take with you some of the
elders of Yisra’ĕl. And take in your hand your rod with which you smote
the river, and go. 
Exod
17:6  “See, I am standing before you
there on the rock in Ḥorĕḇ. And you shall smite the rock, and
water shall come out of it, and the people shall drink.” And Mosheh did so
before the eyes of the elders of Yisra’ĕl. 
Exod
17:7  And he called the name of the place
Massah and Meriḇah, because of the ‘strife’ of the children of Yisra’ĕl,
and because they ‘tried’ יהוה, saying, “Is יהוה
in our midst or not?” 
Exod
17:8  And Amalĕq came and fought
with Yisra’ĕl in Rephiḏim. 
Exod
17:9  And Mosheh said to Yehoshua, “Choose
for us men and go out, fight with Amalĕq. Tomorrow I am stationing myself
on the top of the hill with the rod of Elohim in my hand.” 
Exod
17:10  And Yehoshua did as Mosheh said to
him, to fight with Amalĕq. And Mosheh, Aharon, and Ḥur went up to
the top of the hill. 
Exod
17:11  And it came to be, when Mosheh
held up his hand, that Yisra’ĕl prevailed. And when he let down his hand,
Amalĕq prevailed. 
Exod
17:12  But Mosheh’s hands were heavy, so
they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat on it. And Aharon and Ḥur
supported his hands, one on one side, and the other on the other side. And his
hands were steady until the going down of the sun. 
Exod
17:13  And Yehoshua defeated Amalĕq
and his people with the edge of the sword. 
Exod
17:14  And יהוה
said to Mosheh, “Write this for a remembrance in the book and recite it in the
hearing of Yehoshua, that I shall completely blot out the remembrance of Amalĕq
from under the heavens.” 
Exod
17:15  And Mosheh built an altar and
called its name, יהוה Nissi, 
Exod
17:16  for he said, “Because a hand is on
the throne of Yah, יהוה is to fight against Amalĕq,
from generation to generation.” 
Exod
18:1  And Yithro, the priest of Miḏyan,
Mosheh’s father-in-law, heard of all that Elohim had done for Mosheh and for
Yisra’ĕl His people, that יהוה had brought Yisra’ĕl
out of Mitsrayim. 
Exod
18:2  And Yithro, Mosheh’s father-in-law,
took Tsipporah, the wife of Mosheh – after he had sent her back, 
Exod
18:3  and her two sons, of whom the name
of one was Gĕreshom, for he said, “I have been a sojourner in a foreign
land,” 
Exod
18:4  and the name of the other was Eli‛ezer,
for he said, “The Elohim of my father was my help, and delivered me from the
sword of Pharaoh.” 
Exod
18:5  Yithro, Mosheh’s father-in-law,
came with his sons and his wife to Mosheh in the wilderness, where he was
encamped at the mountain of Elohim. 
Exod
18:6  And he had said to Mosheh, “I, your
father-in-law Yithro, am coming to you with your wife and her two sons with
her.” 
Exod
18:7  And Mosheh went out to meet his
father-in-law, and bowed down, and kissed him. And they asked each other about
their welfare, and they went into the tent. 
Exod
18:8  And Mosheh told his father-in-law
all that יהוה had done to Pharaoh and to the Mitsrites
for Yisra’ĕl’s sake, all the hardship that had come upon them on the way,
and how יהוה had delivered them. 
Exod
18:9  And Yithro rejoiced for all the
good which יהוה had done for Yisra’ĕl, whom He had
delivered out of the hand of the Mitsrites. 
Exod
18:10  And Yithro said, “Blessed be יהוה,
who has delivered you out of the hand of the Mitsrites and out of the hand of
Pharaoh, and who has delivered the people from under the hand of the Mitsrites.

Exod
18:11  “Now I know that יהוה
is greater than all the mighty ones, indeed in the matter in which they acted
proudly, above them.” 
Exod
18:12  Then Yithro, the father-in-law of
Mosheh, brought a burnt offering and other slaughterings unto Elohim. And
Aharon came with all the elders of Yisra’ĕl to eat bread with the
father-in-law of Mosheh before Elohim. 
Exod
18:13  And it came to be, on the next
day, that Mosheh sat to rightly rule the people. And the people stood before
Mosheh from morning until evening. 
Exod
18:14  And when the father-in-law of
Mosheh saw all that he did for the people, he said, “What is this that you are
doing for the people? Why do you sit by yourself, and all the people stand
before you from morning until evening?” 
Exod
18:15  And Mosheh said to his
father-in-law, “Because the people come to me to seek Elohim. 
Exod
18:16  “When they have a matter, they
come to me, and I rightly rule between one and another, and make known the laws
of Elohim and His Torot.” 
Exod
18:17  And the father-in-law of Mosheh
said to him, “What you are doing is not good. 
Exod
18:18  “Both you and these people with
you shall certainly wear yourselves out. For the matter is too heavy for you.
You are not able to do it by yourself. 
Exod
18:19  “Now listen to my voice. Let me
counsel you and Elohim be with you: Stand before Elohim for the people, and you
shall bring the matters to Elohim. 
Exod
18:20  “And you shall enlighten them concerning the laws and the Torot, and
show them the way in which they should walk and the work which they do. 
Exod
18:21  “But you yourself, seek out from
all the people able men, who fear Elohim, men of truth, hating unfair gain. And
place these over them to be rulers of
thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens. 
Exod
18:22  “And they shall rightly rule the
people at all times. And it shall be that they bring every great matter to you,
but they themselves rightly rule every small matter. So, make it lighter for
yourself, for they shall bear with you. 
Exod
18:23  “If you do this word, and Elohim
shall command you, then you shall be able to stand and all this people also go
to their place in peace.” 
Exod
18:24  And Mosheh listened to the voice
of his father-in-law and did all that he said. 
Exod
18:25  And Mosheh chose able men out of
all Yisra’ĕl, and made them heads over the people: rulers of thousands,
rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens. 
Exod
18:26  And they rightly ruled the people
at all times – the hard matters they brought to Mosheh, but they rightly ruled
every small matter themselves. 
Exod
18:27  And Mosheh sent off his
father-in-law, and he went away to his own land. 
Exod
19:1  In the third month after the
children of Yisra’ĕl had come out of the land of Mitsrayim, on this day
they came to the Wilderness of Sinai. 
Exod
19:2  For they set out from Rephiḏim,
and had come to the Wilderness of Sinai, and camped in the wilderness. So Yisra’ĕl
camped there before the mountain. 
Exod
19:3  And Mosheh went up to Elohim, and יהוה
called to him from the mountain, saying, “This is what you are to say to the
house of Ya‛aqoḇ, and declare to the children of Yisra’ĕl:
Exod
19:4  ‘You have seen what I did to the
Mitsrites, and how I bore you on eagles’ wings and brought you to Myself. 
Exod
19:5  ‘And now, if you diligently obey My
voice, and shall guard My covenant, then you shall be My treasured possession
above all the peoples – for all the earth is Mine – 
Exod
19:6  ‘and you shall be to Me a reign of
priests and a set-apart nation.’ Those are the words which you are to speak to
the children of Yisra’ĕl.” 
Exod
19:7  And Mosheh came and called for the
elders of the people, and set before them all these words which יהוה
commanded him. 
Exod
19:8  And all the people answered
together and said, “All that יהוה has spoken we shall
do.” So Mosheh brought back the words of the people to יהוה.

Exod
19:9  And יהוה
said to Mosheh, “See, I am coming to you in the thick cloud, so that the people
hear when I speak with you, and believe you forever.” And Mosheh reported the
words of the people to יהוה.
Exod
19:10  And יהוה
said to Mosheh, “Go to the people and set them apart today and tomorrow. And
they shall wash their garments, 
Exod
19:11  and shall be prepared by the third
day. For on the third day יהוה shall come down upon
Mount Sinai before the eyes of all the people. 
Exod
19:12  “And you shall make a border for
the people all around, saying, ‘Take heed to yourselves that you do not go up
to the mountain or touch the border of it. Whoever touches the mountain shall
certainly be put to death. 
Exod
19:13  ‘Not a hand is to touch it, but he
shall certainly be stoned or shot with an arrow, whether man or beast, he shall
not live.’ When the trumpet sounds long, let them come near the mountain.” 
Exod
19:14  And Mosheh came down from the
mountain to the people and set the people apart, and they washed their
garments. 
Exod
19:15  And he said to the people, “Be
prepared by the third day. Do not come near a wife.” 
Exod
19:16  And it came to be, on the third
day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud
on the mountain. And the sound of the ram’s horn was very loud, and all the
people who were in the camp trembled. 
Exod
19:17  And Mosheh brought the people out
of the camp to meet with Elohim, and they stood at the foot of the mountain. 
Exod
19:18  And Mount Sinai was in smoke, all
of it, because יהוה descended upon it in fire. And its
smoke went up like the smoke of a furnace, and all the mountain trembled
exceedingly. 
Exod
19:19  And when the blast of the ram’s
horn sounded long and became louder and louder, Mosheh spoke, and Elohim
answered him by voice. 
Exod
19:20  And יהוה
came down upon Mount Sinai, on the top of the mountain. And יהוה
called Mosheh to the top of the mountain, and Mosheh went up. 
Exod
19:21  And יהוה
said to Mosheh, “Go down, and warn
the people, lest they break through unto יהוה to see,
and many of them fall. 
Exod
19:22  “And let the priests who come near
יהוה set themselves apart too, lest יהוה
break out against them.” 
Exod
19:23  And Mosheh said to יהוה,
“The people are not able to come up to Mount Sinai, for You warned us, saying, ‘Make
a border around the mountain and set it apart.’ ” 
Exod
19:24  And יהוה
said to him, “Come, go down and then come up, you and Aharon with you. But do
not let the priests and the people break through to come up to יהוה,
lest He break out against them.” 
Exod
19:25  And Mosheh went down to the people
and spoke to them. 
Exod
20:1  And Elohim spoke all these Words,
saying, 
Exod
20:2  “I am יהוה
your Elohim, who brought you out of the land of Mitsrayim, out of the house of
slavery. 
Exod
20:3  “You have no other mighty ones
against My face. 
Exod
20:4  “You do not make for yourself a
carved image, or any likeness of that which is in the heavens above, or which
is in the earth beneath, or which is in the waters under the earth, 
Exod
20:5  you do not bow down to them nor
serve them. For I, יהוה your Elohim am a jealous Ĕl,
visiting the crookedness of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth
generations of those who hate Me, 
Exod
20:6  but showing kindness to thousands,
to those who love Me and guard My commands.
Exod
20:7  “You do not bring the Name of יהוה
your Elohim to naught, for יהוה does not leave the one
unpunished who brings His Name to naught.
Exod
20:8  “Remember the Sabbath day, to set
it apart. 
Exod
20:9  “Six days you labour, and shall do
all your work, 
Exod
20:10  but the seventh day is a Sabbath
of יהוה your Elohim. You do not do any work – you, nor
your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant,
nor your cattle, nor your stranger who is within your gates.
Exod
20:11  “For in six days יהוה
made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested
the seventh day. Therefore יהוה blessed the Sabbath day
and set it apart. 
Exod
20:12  “Respect your father and your
mother, so that your days are prolonged upon the soil which יהוה
your Elohim is giving you. 
Exod
20:13  “You do not murder. 
Exod
20:14  “You do not commit adultery. 
Exod
20:15  “You do not steal. 
Exod
20:16  “You do not bear false witness
against your neighbour. 
Exod
20:17  “You do not covet your neighbour’s
house, you do not covet your neighbour’s wife, nor his male servant, nor his
female servant, nor his ox, nor his donkey, or whatever belongs to your neighbour.”

Exod
20:18  And all the people saw the
thunders, the lightning flashes, the sound of the ram’s horn, and the mountain
smoking. And the people saw it, and they trembled and stood at a distance, 
Exod
20:19  and said to Mosheh, “You speak
with us and we hear, but let not Elohim speak with us, lest we die.” 
Exod
20:20  And Mosheh said to the people, “Do
not fear, for Elohim has come to prove you, and in order that His fear be
before you, so that you do not sin.” 
Exod
20:21  So the people stood at a distance,
but Mosheh drew near the thick darkness where Elohim was. 
Exod
20:22  And יהוה
said to Mosheh, “Say this to the children of Yisra’ĕl: ‘You yourselves
have seen that I have spoken to you from the heavens. 
Exod
20:23  ‘You do not make besides Me mighty
ones of silver, and you do not make mighty ones of gold for yourselves. 
Exod
20:24  ‘Make an altar of earth for Me,
and you shall slaughter on it your burnt offerings and your peace offerings,
your sheep and your cattle. In every place where I cause My Name to be
remembered I shall come to you and bless you. 
Exod
20:25  ‘And if you make Me an altar of
stone, do not build it of cut stone, for if you use your chisel on it, you have
profaned it. 
Exod
20:26  ‘Nor do you go up by steps to My
altar, lest your nakedness be exposed on it.’ 
Exod
21:1  “These are the right-rulings which
you are to set before them: 
Exod
21:2  “When you buy a Heḇrew
servant, he serves six years, and in the seventh he goes out free, for naught. 
Exod
21:3  “If he comes in by himself, he goes
out by himself; if he comes in married, then his wife shall go out with him. 
Exod
21:4  “If his master has given him a
wife, and she has borne him sons or daughters, the wife and her children are
her master’s, and he goes out by himself. 
Exod
21:5  “And if the servant truly says, ‘I
love my master, my wife, and my children, let me not go out free,’ 
Exod
21:6  then his master shall bring him
before Elohim, and shall bring him to the door, or to the doorpost, and his
master shall pierce his ear with an awl. And he shall serve him forever. 
Exod
21:7  “And when a man sells his daughter
to be a female servant, she does not go out as the male servants do. 
Exod
21:8  “If she is displeasing in the eyes
of her master who has engaged her to himself, then he shall let her be
ransomed. He shall have no authority to sell her to a foreign people, because
of him deceiving her. 
Exod
21:9  “And if he has engaged her to his
son, he is to do to her as is the right of daughters.
Exod
21:10  “If he takes another wife, her food, her covering, and her
marriage rights are not to be diminished. 
Exod
21:11  “And if he does not do these three
for her, then she shall go out for naught, without silver. 
Exod
21:12  “He who strikes a man so that he
dies shall certainly be put to death. 
Exod
21:13  “But if he did not lie in wait,
but Elohim delivered him into his hand, then I shall appoint for you a place
where he is to flee. 
Exod
21:14  “But when a man acts
presumptuously against his neighbour, to kill him by treachery, you are to take
him even from My altar to die. 
Exod
21:15  “And he who smites his father or
his mother shall certainly be put to death. 
Exod
21:16  “And he who kidnaps a man and
sells him, or if he is found in his hand, shall certainly be put to death. 
Exod
21:17  “And he who curses his father or
his mother shall certainly be put to death. 
Exod
21:18  “And when men strive together, and
one smites the other with a stone or with his fist, and he does not die but is
confined to his bed, 
Exod
21:19  if he rises again and walks about
outside with his staff, then he who smote him shall be innocent. He only pays
for lost time and sees to it that he is completely healed. 
Exod
21:20  “And when a man smites his male or
female servant with a rod, so that he dies under his hand, he shall certainly
be punished. 
Exod
21:21  “But if he remains alive a day or
two, he is not punished; for he is his property. 
Exod
21:22  “And when men strive and they
shall smite a pregnant woman, and her children come out, yet there is no
injury, he shall certainly be punished accordingly as the woman’s husband lays
upon him. And he shall give through the judges. 
Exod
21:23  “But if there is injury, then you
shall give life for life, 
Exod
21:24  eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand
for hand, foot for foot, 
Exod
21:25  burn for burn, wound for wound,
lash for lash. 
Exod
21:26  “And when a man smites the eye of
his male or female servant, and destroys it, he is to let him go free for the
sake of his eye. 
Exod
21:27  “And if he knocks out the tooth of
his male or female servant, he is to let him go free for the sake of his tooth.

Exod
21:28  “And when an ox gores a man or a
woman to death, then the ox shall certainly be stoned, and its flesh is not
eaten, and the owner of the ox is innocent. 
Exod
21:29  “However, if the ox was previously
in the habit of goring, and its owner has been warned, and he has not kept it
confined, so that it has killed a man or a woman, the ox is stoned and its
owner also is put to death. 
Exod
21:30  “If a sin-covering is laid upon
him, then he shall give the ransom of his life, whatever is laid on him. 
Exod
21:31  “Whether it has gored a son or
gored a daughter, according to this right-ruling it is done to him. 
Exod
21:32  “If the ox gores a male or female
servant, he is to give to their master thirty sheqels of silver, and the ox is
stoned. 
Exod
21:33  “And when a man opens a pit, or if
a man digs a pit and does not cover it, and an ox or a donkey falls in it, 
Exod
21:34  the owner of the pit is to repay,
he is to give silver to their owner, and the dead beast is his. 
Exod
21:35  “And when the ox of a man smites
the ox of his neighbour and it dies, then they shall sell the live ox and
divide the silver from it, and also divide the dead ox. 
Exod
21:36  “Or if it was known that the ox
was previously in the habit of goring, and its owner has not kept it confined,
he shall certainly repay ox for ox, while the dead beast is his. 
Exod
22:1  “When a man steals an ox or a
sheep, and shall slaughter it or sell it, he repays five cattle for an ox and
four sheep for a sheep. 
Exod
22:2  “If the thief is found breaking in,
and he is smitten so that he dies, there is no guilt for his bloodshed. 
Exod
22:3  “If the sun has risen on him, there
is guilt for his bloodshed, he shall certainly repay. If he has not the means,
then he shall be sold for his theft. 
Exod
22:4  “If the theft is indeed found alive
in his hand, whether it is an ox or donkey or sheep, he repays double. 
Exod
22:5  “When a man lets a field or vineyard
be grazed bare, and lets loose his
livestock, and it feeds in another man’s field, he repays from the best of his
own field and the best of his own vineyard. 
Exod
22:6  “When fire breaks out and spreads
to thorn bushes, so that stacked grain, or standing grain, or the field is
consumed, he who kindled the fire shall certainly repay. 
Exod
22:7  “When a man gives silver or goods
to his neighbour to guard, and it is stolen out of the man’s house, if the
thief is found, he repays double. 
Exod
22:8  “If the thief is not found, then
the master of the house shall be brought before Elohim to see whether he has
put his hand into his neighbour’s goods. 
Exod
22:9  “For every matter of transgression,
for ox, for donkey, for sheep, for garment, or for whatever is lost which
another claims to be his, let the matter of them both come before Elohim. And
whomever Elohim declares wrong repays double to his neighbour. 
Exod
22:10  “When a man gives to his neighbour
a donkey, or ox, or sheep, or any beast to watch over, and it dies, or is
injured, or is driven away while no one is looking, 
Exod
22:11  let an oath of יהוה
be between them both, that he has not put his hand into his neighbour’s goods.
And the owner of it shall accept that, and he does not repay. 
Exod
22:12  “But if it is indeed stolen from
him, he repays to its owner. 
Exod
22:13  “If it is torn to pieces, then let
him bring it for evidence, he does not repay what was torn. 
Exod
22:14  “And when a man borrows from his
neighbour, and it is injured or dies while the owner of it is not present, he
shall certainly repay. 
Exod
22:15  “But if its owner was with it, he
does not repay. If it was hired, he is entitled to the hire. 
Exod
22:16  “And when a man entices a maiden
who is not engaged, and lies with her, he shall certainly pay the bride-price
for her to be his wife. 
Exod
22:17  “If her father absolutely refuses
to give her to him, he pays according to the bride-price of maidens. 
Exod
22:18  “Do not allow a practiser of
witchcraft to live. 
Exod
22:19  “Anyone lying with a beast shall
certainly be put to death. 
Exod
22:20  “He who slaughters to a mighty
one, except to יהוה only, is put under the ban. 
Exod
22:21  “Do not tread down a sojourner or
oppress him, for you were sojourners in the land of Mitsrayim. 
Exod
22:22  “Do not afflict any widow or
fatherless child. 
Exod
22:23  “If you do afflict them at all –
if they cry out to Me at all, I shall certainly hear their cry, 
Exod
22:24  and My wrath shall burn and I
shall slay you with the sword, your wives shall be widows and your children
fatherless. 
Exod
22:25  “If you do lend silver to any of
My people, the poor among you, you are not to be like one that lends on
interest to him. Do not lay interest on him.
