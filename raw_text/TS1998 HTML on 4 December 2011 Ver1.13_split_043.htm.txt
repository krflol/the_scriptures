Miḵah/Micah
Micah
1:1  The word of יהוה
that came to Miḵah of Moresheth in the days of Yotham, Aḥaz, Ḥizqiyah,
sovereigns of Yehuḏah, which he saw concerning Shomeron and Yerushalayim.

Micah
1:2  Hear, all you peoples! Listen, O
earth, and all who are in it! And let the Master יהוה
be a witness against you – יהוה from His set-apart Hĕḵal.

Micah
1:3  For look, יהוה
is coming out of His place, and He shall come down and shall tread on the high
places of the earth.
Micah
1:4  And the mountains shall melt under
Him, and the valleys be cleft as wax before the fire, as waters poured down a
steep place.
Micah
1:5  All this is for the transgression of
Ya‛aqoḇ and for the sins of the house of Yisra’ĕl. What is the
transgression of Ya‛aqoḇ? Is it not Shomeron? And what are the high
places of Yehuḏah? Are they not Yerushalayim? 
Micah
1:6  “And I shall make Shomeron a heap in
the field, places for planting a vineyard. And I shall pour down her stones
into the valley, and uncover her foundations. 
Micah
1:7  “And all her carved images shall be
beaten in pieces, and all her gifts be burned with the fire. And all her idols
I shall lay waste, for she gathered it from the hire of a whore, and they shall
return to the hire of a whore.” 
Micah
1:8  Because of this I lament and howl. I
go stripped and naked. I make a lamentation like jackals, and a mourning like
ostriches. 
Micah
1:9  For her wounds are incurable. For it
has come to Yehuḏah, it has come to the gate of My people, to
Yerushalayim. 
Micah
1:10  Do not declare it in Gath, weep not
at all in Bĕyth Aphrah, roll yourself in the dust. 
Micah
1:11  Pass by in nakedness and shame, you
inhabitant of Shaphir. The inhabitant of Tsa’anan has not gone out. The
lamentation of Bĕyth Ĕtsel takes from you its standing place. 
Micah
1:12  Though the inhabitants of Maroth
waited for good, yet evil came down from יהוה to the
gate of Yerushalayim. 
Micah
1:13  O inhabitant of Laḵish,
harness the chariot to the horse – she was the beginning of sin to the daughter
of Tsiyon – for the transgressions of Yisra’ĕl were found in you. 
Micah
1:14  Therefore you shall give parting
gifts to Moresheth Gath, the houses of Aḵziḇ becoming a deception
to the sovereigns of Yisra’ĕl. 
Micah
1:15  Again I shall bring a dispossessor
to you, O inhabitant of Marĕshah. The esteem of Yisra’ĕl shall come
to Aḏullam. 
Micah
1:16  Make yourself bald and cut off your
hair for the children of your delight. Enlarge your baldness like an eagle, for
they shall be exiled from you. 
Micah
2:1  Woe to those plotting wickedness,
and working out evil upon their beds! In the light of the morning they practise
it, because it is in the might of their hand. 
Micah
2:2  And they coveted fields and seized
them, also houses, and took them away. And they oppressed a man and his house,
a man and his inheritance. 
Micah
2:3  Therefore thus said יהוה,
“See, against this clan I am planning evil, from which you do not remove your
necks, nor walk proudly, for this is a time of evil. 
Micah
2:4  “In that day one shall lift up a
proverb against you, and he shall lament with a bitter lamentation, and shall
say, ‘We have been utterly ravaged! He changes the inheritance of my people.
How He removes it from me! He apportions our fields to the backslider.’ ” 
Micah
2:5  “Therefore you shall have no one in
the assembly of יהוה to divide the land by lot. 
Micah
2:6  “You do not preach, they preach.
They do not preach to these, reproaches are not turned back. 
Micah
2:7  “Are you called ‘House of Ya‛aqoḇ’?
Has the Spirit of יהוה been limited? Are these His
doings? Do not My words do good to the one walking uprightly? 
Micah
2:8  “And lately My people have risen up
as an enemy. You strip off the robe with the garment from those who trust you,
as they pass by – those returning from battle. 
Micah
2:9  “You have driven the women of My people
from their pleasant houses. You have taken away My splendour from their
children forever. 
Micah
2:10  “Arise and go, for this is not your
rest, because uncleanness destroys, and the destruction is grievous. 
Micah
2:11  “If a man walking after wind and
falsehood has lied: ‘I preach to you of wine and of strong drink,’ he shall be
the ‘preacher’ of this people! 
Micah
2:12  “I shall certainly gather all of
you, O Ya‛aqoḇ, I shall bring together the remnant of Yisra’ĕl,
put them together like sheep of the fold, like a flock in the midst of their
pasture, they being noisy because of men. 
Micah
2:13  “The breach-maker shall go up
before them. They shall break out, and pass through the gate, and go out by it,
and their sovereign pass before them, with יהוה at
their head!” 
Micah
3:1  Then I said, “Hear now, O heads of
Ya‛aqoḇ, and you rulers of the house of Yisra’ĕl: Should you
not know right-ruling, 
Micah
3:2  you who are hating good and loving
evil, tearing away the skin from My people, and the flesh from their bones, 
Micah
3:3  and who have eaten the flesh of My
people, and stripped off their skin, and have broken their bones, and have cut
it up as into a pot, like flesh in the cooking pot?” 
Micah
3:4  Therefore, when they cry to יהוה
He does not answer them, and hides His face from them at that time, as they
have made their deeds evil. 
Micah
3:5  Thus said יהוה
concerning the prophets who lead my people astray, who are biting with their
teeth and have called out, “Peace!” They even set apart a battle against him
who does not give for their mouths. 
Micah
3:6  Therefore it shall be night to you
without vision, and darkness to you without divination. The sun shall go down
on the prophets, and the day shall be dark for them. 
Micah
3:7  And the seers shall be ashamed, and
the diviners embarrassed. And they shall all cover their lips, for there is no
answer, O Elohim. 
Micah
3:8  But truly I am filled with power,
with the Spirit of יהוה, and with right-ruling and with
might, to declare to Ya‛aqoḇ his transgression and to Yisra’ĕl
his sin.
Micah
3:9  Hear this, please, you heads of the
house of Ya‛aqoḇ and you rulers of the house of Yisra’ĕl, who
despise right-ruling and distort all that is straight, 
Micah
3:10  those building up Tsiyon with
bloodshed and Yerushalayim with unrighteousness. 
Micah
3:11  Her heads judge for a bribe, her
priests teach for pay, and her prophets divine for a price. Yet they lean on יהוה,
and say, “Is not יהוה in our midst? Evil does not come
upon us.”
Micah
3:12  Therefore, because of you, Tsiyon
is ploughed like a field, and Yerushalayim becomes heaps, and the mountain of
the House like a wooded height. 
Micah
4:1  And in the latter days it shall be
that the mountain of the House of יהוה is established
on the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills. And peoples
shall flow to it. 
Micah
4:2  And many nations shall come and say,
“Come, and let us go up to the mountain of יהוה, to the
House of the Elohim of Ya‛aqoḇ, and let Him teach us His ways, and
let us walk in His paths. For out of Tsiyon comes forth the Torah, and the word
of יהוה from Yerushalayim.”
Micah
4:3  And He shall judge among many
peoples, and reprove strong nations afar off. They shall beat their swords into
ploughshares, and their spears into pruning hooks – nation shall not lift up
sword against nation, neither teach battle any more. 
Micah
4:4  But each one shall sit under his
vine and under his fig tree, with no one to make them afraid, for the mouth of יהוה
of hosts has spoken. 
Micah
4:5  For all the peoples walk, each one
in the name of his mighty one, but we walk in the Name of יהוה
our Elohim forever and ever.
Micah
4:6  “In that day,” declares יהוה,
“I gather the lame, and I bring together the outcast and those whom I have
afflicted. 
Micah
4:7  “And I shall make the lame a
remnant, and the outcast a strong nation. And יהוה
shall reign over them in Mount Tsiyon, from now on and forever.
Micah
4:8  “And you, O tower of the flock,
stronghold of the daughter of Tsiyon, it shall come to you, the former rule
shall come, the reign of the daughter of Yerushalayim.” 
Micah
4:9  Now why do you cry aloud? Is there
no sovereign in you? Has your counsellor perished? For pain has gripped you
like a woman in labour. 
Micah
4:10  Be in pain, and deliver, O daughter
of Tsiyon, like a woman in labour. For now you are to leave the city, and you
shall dwell in the field. And you shall go to Baḇel, there you shall be
delivered, there יהוה shall redeem you from the hand of
your enemies. 
Micah
4:11  And now, many gentiles shall be
gathered against you, who are saying, “Let her be defiled, and let our eyes
look upon Tsiyon!” 
Micah
4:12  But they do not know the thoughts
of יהוה, nor do they understand His counsel. For He has
gathered them like sheaves to the threshing-floor. 
Micah
4:13  “Arise and thresh, O daughter of
Tsiyon, for I make your horn iron and your hooves bronze. And you shall beat
many peoples into pieces, and I shall seclude their gain to יהוה,
and their wealth to the Master of all the earth.” 
Micah
5:1  Now you are raided, O daughter of
raiders, a siege has been laid against us. They strike the Judge of Yisra’ĕl
with a rod on the cheek. 
Micah
5:2  “But you, Bĕyth Leḥem
Ephrathah, you who are little among the clans of Yehuḏah, out of you
shall come forth to Me the One to become Ruler in Yisra’ĕl. And His
comings forth are of old, from everlasting.”
Micah
5:3  Therefore He shall give them up,
until the time that she who is in labour has given birth, and the remnant of
His brothers return to the children of Yisra’ĕl. 
Micah
5:4  And He shall stand and shepherd in
the strength of יהוה, in the excellency of the Name of יהוה
His Elohim. And they shall dwell, for at that time He shall be great, to the
ends of the earth.
Micah
5:5  And this shall be peace. When
Ashshur comes into our land, and when he treads in our palaces, we shall raise
against him seven shepherds and eight leaders of men. 
Micah
5:6  And they shall shepherd the land of
Ashshur with the sword, and the land of Nimroḏ at its entrances. And He
shall deliver us from Ashshur, when he comes into our land and when he treads
within our borders. 
Micah
5:7  And the remnant of Ya‛aqoḇ
shall be in the midst of many peoples, as dew from יהוה,
as showers on the grass, which do not wait for man nor delay for the sons of
men. 
Micah
5:8  And the remnant of Ya‛aqoḇ
shall be among the gentiles, in the midst of many peoples, like a lion among
the beasts of a forest, like a young lion among flocks of sheep, who, if he
passes through, shall both tread down and shall tear, and there is no one to
deliver. 
Micah
5:9  Let your hand be lifted up against
your adversaries, and all your enemies be cut off. 
Micah
5:10  “And it shall be in that day,”
declares יהוה, “that I shall cut off your horses out of
your midst, and I shall destroy your chariots. 
Micah
5:11  “And I shall cut off the cities of
your land, and I shall pull down all your strongholds. 
Micah
5:12  “And I shall cut off witchcrafts
out of your hand, and let you have no magicians. 
Micah
5:13  “And I shall cut off your carved
images, and your pillars from your midst, so that you no longer bow down to the
work of your hands. 
Micah
5:14  “And I shall pluck your Ashĕrim
out of your midst, and I shall destroy your cities. 
Micah
5:15  “And I shall take vengeance in
wrath and rage on the gentiles who did not obey.” 
Micah
6:1  Hear now what יהוה
is saying, “Arise, strive with the mountains, and let the hills hear your
voice. 
Micah
6:2  “Hear, O you mountains, the
controversy of יהוה, and you everlasting foundations of
the earth! For יהוה has a controversy with His people
and He shall reprove Yisra’ĕl. 
Micah
6:3  “My people, what have I done to you?
And how have I wearied you? Answer Me, 
Micah
6:4  for I brought you up from the land
of Mitsrayim, and I ransomed you from the house of bondage. And I sent Mosheh,
Aharon, and Miryam before you. 
Micah
6:5  “My people, remember, please, what
Balaq sovereign of Mo’aḇ counselled, and what Bil‛am son of Be‛or
answered him, from Shittim to Gilgal, in order to know the righteousness of יהוה.”

Micah
6:6  With what shall I come before יהוה,
bow myself before the high Elohim? Shall I come before Him with burnt
offerings, with calves a year old? 
Micah
6:7  Is יהוה pleased
with thousands of rams or ten thousand rivers of oil? Shall I give my
first-born for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my being? 
Micah
6:8  He has declared to you, O man, what
is good. And what does יהוה require of you but to do
right, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your Elohim? 
Micah
6:9  The voice of יהוה
cries to the city – and let sound wisdom see Your Name! “Hear the Rod and Him
who appointed it! 
Micah
6:10  “Are there still treasures of
wrongness in the house of the wrong, and the short measure that is an
abomination?” 
Micah
6:11  Would I be innocent with wrong
scales, and with a bag of false weights? 
Micah
6:12  “For her rich men are filled with
cruel unrighteousness, and her inhabitants have spoken falsehood, and their
tongue is deceit in their mouth. 
Micah
6:13  “So I also, I shall smite you with
a grievous wound, to lay you waste because of your sins: 
Micah
6:14  “You shall eat but not be
satisfied, and your inside be empty. And you shall store up but not save, and
what you save I shall give to the sword. 
Micah
6:15  “You shall sow but not reap, you
shall tread the olives but not anoint yourselves with oil, and make sweet wine
but not drink wine. 
Micah
6:16  “For the laws of Omri are strictly
observed, and all the works of the house of Aḥab, and you walk in their
counsels. Therefore I give you for a ruin, and your inhabitants for a hissing,
and let you bear the reproach of My people.” 
Micah
7:1  Woe to me! For I am as gatherings of
summer fruit, as gleanings of the grape harvest. There is no cluster to eat. My
being has desired the first-ripe fruit. 
Micah
7:2  The kind one has perished from the
earth, and there is no one straight among men. All of them lie in wait for
blood, everyone hunts his brother with a net. 
Micah
7:3  Both hands are on the evil, to do it
well. The prince asks for gifts, the judge seeks a bribe, and the great man
speaks the desire of his being. And they weave it together. 
Micah
7:4  The best of them is like a prickly
plant, the most straight is sharper than a thorn hedge. The day of your
watchman and your punishment has come, now is their confusion. 
Micah
7:5  Trust no friend, rely on no
companion, guard the doors of your mouth from her who lies in your bosom. 
Micah
7:6  For son is despising father,
daughter rises up against her mother, daughter-in-law against her
mother-in-law, the enemies of a man are the men of his own house. 
Micah
7:7  As for me, I look to יהוה,
I wait for the Elohim of my deliverance, my Elohim does hear me. 
Micah
7:8  Do not rejoice over me, O my enemy.
When I have fallen I have risen, when I sit in darkness יהוה
is a light to me. 
Micah
7:9  I bear the displeasure of יהוה,
for I have sinned against Him, until He pleads my case, and shall execute right-ruling
for me, until He brings me out into
the light and I look on His righteousness. 
Micah
7:10  And let my enemy see it, and let
shame cover her who said to me, “Where is יהוה your
Elohim?” Let my eyes look on her: now she is trampled down like mud in the
streets. 
Micah
7:11  The day for building your walls!
Let the decree go far and wide in that day – 
Micah
7:12  that day when they come to you from
Ashshur and the besieged cities of Mitsrayim, and from the siege to the River,
and from sea to sea, and mountain to mountain.
Micah
7:13  But the earth shall become a waste
because of those who dwell in it, and for the fruit of their deeds. 
Micah
7:14  Shepherd Your people with Your rod,
the flock of Your inheritance, who dwell alone in a forest, in the midst of
Karmel. Let them feed in Bashan and Gil‛aḏ, as in days of old. 
Micah
7:15  “As in the days when you came out
of the land of Mitsrayim, I shall let him see wonders.” 
Micah
7:16  Let the gentiles see and be ashamed
of all their might, let them put their hand over their mouth, let their ears be
deaf. 
Micah
7:17  Let them lick the dust like a
serpent, let them come trembling from their strongholds like snakes of the
earth, let them be afraid of יהוה our Elohim and fear
because of You. 
Micah
7:18  Who is an Ĕl like You – taking
away crookedness and passing over the transgression of the remnant of His
inheritance? He shall not retain His wrath forever, for He Himself delights in
kindness. 
Micah
7:19  He shall turn back, He shall have
compassion on us, He shall trample upon our crookednesses! And You throw all
our sins into the depths of the sea! 
Micah
7:20  You give truth to Ya‛aqoḇ,
kindness to Aḇraham, which You swore to our fathers from the days of old!
