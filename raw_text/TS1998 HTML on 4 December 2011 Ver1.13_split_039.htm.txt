Yo’ĕl/Joel
Joel
1:1  The word of יהוה
that came to Yo’ĕl son of Pethu’ĕl. 
Joel
1:2  Hear this, you elders, and give ear,
all you inhabitants of the land! Has this ever
been in your days, or even in the days of your fathers? 
Joel
1:3  Relate it to your children, and your
children to their children, and their children to the generation after them. 
Joel
1:4  What the gnawing locust left the
swarming locust has eaten, and what the swarming locust left the crawling
locust has eaten, and what the crawling locust left the consuming locust has
eaten. 
Joel
1:5  Wake up, you drunkards, and weep.
And wail, all you drinkers of wine, on account of the new wine, for it has been
cut off from your mouth. 
Joel
1:6  For a nation has come up against My
land, strong, and innumerable. Its teeth are the teeth of a lion, and it has
the fangs of a lioness. 
Joel
1:7  It has laid waste My vine and
splintered My fig tree. It has made it entirely bare and cast it away, its
branches became white. 
Joel
1:8  Wail like a maiden girded with
sackcloth for the husband of her youth. 
Joel
1:9  The grain offering and the drink
offering have been cut off from the House of יהוה. The
priests, servants of יהוה, have mourned. 
Joel
1:10  The field is ravaged, the ground
has mourned, for the grain is ruined, the new wine has dried up, the oil fails.

Joel
1:11  The farmers are ashamed, the
vinedressers wail over the wheat and over the barley, for the harvest of the
field is destroyed. 
Joel
1:12  The vine has dried up, and the fig
tree droops, pomegranate, also palm, and apple tree, all the trees of the field
are dried up, because joy has dried up among the sons of men. 
Joel
1:13  Gird yourselves and lament, you
priests. Wail, you attendants of the altar. Come, lie all night in sackcloth,
you attendants of my Elohim. For the grain offering and the drink offering are
withheld from the house of your Elohim. 
Joel
1:14  Set apart a fast. Call an assembly,
gather the elders, all the inhabitants of the land, into the House of יהוה
your Elohim, and cry out to יהוה. 
Joel
1:15  Alas for the day! For the day of יהוה
is near, and it comes as destruction from the Almighty. 
Joel
1:16  Is not the food cut off before our
eyes, joy and gladness from the House of our Elohim? 
Joel
1:17  The seed has rotted under their
clods, storehouses are laid waste, granaries are broken down, for the grain has
withered. 
Joel
1:18  How the beasts moan! The herds of
cattle are restless, because they have no pasture. The flocks of sheep also
perish. 
Joel
1:19  I cry to You יהוה,
for fire has consumed the pastures of the wilderness, and a flame has set on
fire all the trees of the field. 
Joel
1:20  Even the beasts of the field cry
out to You, for the water streams are dried up, and fire has consumed the
pastures of the wilderness. 
Joel
2:1  Blow a ram’s horn in Tsiyon, and
sound an alarm in My set-apart mountain! Let all the inhabitants of the earth
tremble, for the day of יהוה is coming, for it is near:

Joel
2:2  a day of darkness and gloom, a day
of clouds and thick darkness, like the morning clouds spread over the mountains
– a people many and strong, the like of whom has never been, nor shall there ever
be again after them, to the years of many generations. 
Joel
2:3  Ahead of them a fire has consumed,
and behind them a flame burns. Before them the land is like the Garden of Ĕḏen,
and behind them a desert waste. And from them there is no escape. 
Joel
2:4  Their appearance is like the
appearance of horses, and they run like steeds. 
Joel
2:5  As the noise of chariots they leap
over mountaintops, as the noise of a flaming fire consuming stubble, as a
mighty people set in battle array. 
Joel
2:6  Before them peoples are in anguish,
all faces become flushed. 
Joel
2:7  They run like mighty men, they climb
the wall like men of battle, every one goes on his way, and they do not break
ranks. 
Joel
2:8  And they do not press one another,
every one goes in his path. They fall among the weapons, but they do not stop. 
Joel
2:9  They rush on the city, they run on
the wall. They climb into the houses, they enter at the windows like a thief. 
Joel
2:10  The earth shall tremble before
them, the heavens shall shake. Sun and moon shall be darkened, and the stars
withdraw their brightness. 
Joel
2:11  And יהוה
shall give forth His voice before His army, for His camp is very great, for
mighty is the doer of His word. For the day of יהוה is
great and very awesome, and who does bear it? 
Joel
2:12  “Yet even now,” declares יהוה,
“turn to Me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with
mourning.” 
Joel
2:13  And tear your heart and not your
garments, and turn back to יהוה your Elohim, for He
shows favour and is compassionate, patient, and of great kindness, and He shall
relent concerning the evil. 
Joel
2:14  Who knows – He might turn and
relent, and leave a blessing behind Him, a grain offering and a drink offering
for יהוה your Elohim? 
Joel
2:15  Blow a ram’s horn in Tsiyon, set
apart a fast, call an assembly. 
Joel
2:16  Gather the people, set the assembly
apart, assemble the elders, gather the children and nursing babes. Let a
bridegroom come out from his room, and a bride from her dressing room. 
Joel
2:17  Let the priests, servants of יהוה,
weep between the porch and the altar. And let them say, “Spare Your people, O יהוה,
and do not give Your inheritance to reproach, for the gentiles to rule over
them. Why should they say among the peoples, ‘Where is their Elohim?’ ” 
Joel
2:18  And let יהוה
be jealous for His land, and spare His people. 
Joel
2:19  And let יהוה
answer and say to His people, “See, I am sending you the grain and the new wine
and the oil, and you shall be satisfied by them. And no longer do I make you a
reproach among the gentiles. 
Joel
2:20  “And the Northerner I shall remove
far from you, and drive him away into a dry and deserted land, with his face
toward the eastern sea and his rear toward the western sea. And his stench
shall come up and his smell rise, for he has done greatly.” 
Joel
2:21  Do not fear, O soil, be glad and
rejoice, for יהוה has done greatly! 
Joel
2:22  Do not fear, you beasts of the
field, for the pastures of the wilderness shall spring forth, and the tree
shall bear its fruit, the fig tree and the vine shall yield their strength.
Joel
2:23  And you children of Tsiyon, be glad
and rejoice in יהוה your Elohim, for He shall give you
the Teacher of Righteousness, and cause the rain to come down for you, the
former rain and the latter rain, as before.
Joel
2:24  And the threshing-floors shall be
filled with grain, and the vats shall overflow with new wine and oil. 
Joel
2:25  “Then I shall repay you the years
that the swarming locust has eaten, the crawling locust, and the consuming
locust, and the gnawing locust, My great army which I sent among you. 
Joel
2:26  “Then you shall eat – eat and be
satisfied – and shall praise the Name of יהוה your
Elohim, who has done with you so wondrously. And My people shall never be put
to shame. 
Joel
2:27  “And you shall know that I am in
the midst of Yisra’ĕl, and that I am יהוה your
Elohim and there is no one else. And My people shall never be put to shame.
Joel
2:28  “And after this it shall be that I
pour out My Spirit on all flesh. And your sons and your daughters shall
prophesy, your old men dream dreams, your young men see visions.
Joel
2:29  “And also on the male servants and
on the female servants I shall pour out My Spirit in those days. 
Joel
2:30  “And I shall give signs in the
heavens and upon the earth: blood and fire and columns of smoke, 
Joel
2:31  the sun is turned into darkness,
and the moon into blood, before the coming of the great and awesome day of יהוה.

Joel
2:32  “And it shall be that everyone who
calls on the Name of יהוה shall be delivered. For on
Mount Tsiyon and in Yerushalayim there shall be an escape as יהוה
has said, and among the survivors whom יהוה calls.
Joel
3:1  “For look, in those days and at that
time, when I turn back the captivity of Yehuḏah and Yerushalayim, 
Joel
3:2  then I shall gather all gentiles,
and bring them down to the Valley of Yehoshaphat. And I shall enter into
judgment with them there for My people, My inheritance Yisra’ĕl, whom they
have scattered among the gentiles, and they have divided up My land. 
Joel
3:3  “And they have cast lots for My
people, and have given a young man for a whore, and sold a girl for wine, and
drank it. 
Joel
3:4  “And also, what are you to Me, O
Tsor and Tsiḏon, and all the coasts of Philistia? Are you repaying Me?
And if you are repaying Me, I would swiftly and speedily return your reward on
your own head. 
Joel
3:5  “For you have taken My silver and My
gold, and brought My treasures into your temples, 
Joel
3:6  and the people of Yehuḏah and
the people of Yerushalayim you have sold to the sons of Yawan, to remove them
far from their borders. 
Joel
3:7  “See, I am stirring them up out of
the place to which you have sold them, and I shall return on your own head what
you have done, 
Joel
3:8  and shall sell your sons and your
daughters into the hand of the people of Yehuḏah, and they shall sell
them to the Sheḇaites, to a nation far off. For יהוה
has spoken.” 
Joel
3:9  Proclaim this among the gentiles, “Prepare
for battle! Wake up the mighty men, let all the men of battle draw near, let
them come up. 
Joel
3:10  “Beat your ploughshares into swords
and your pruning-hooks into spears, let the weak say, ‘I am strong.’ ” 
Joel
3:11  Hasten and come, all you gentiles,
and gather together all around. O יהוה, let Your mighty
men come down here. 
Joel
3:12  “Let the gentiles be aroused, and
come up to the Valley of Yehoshaphat. For there I shall sit to judge all the
gentiles on every side. 
Joel
3:13  “Put in the sickle, for the harvest
has grown ripe. Come, go down, for the winepress is filled, the vats overflow,
for their evil is great.” 
Joel
3:14  Crowds, crowds in the valley of
decision! For the day of יהוה is near in the valley of
decision. 
Joel
3:15  Sun and moon shall become dark, and
stars shall withdraw their brightness. 
Joel
3:16  And יהוה
shall roar from Tsiyon, and give forth His voice from Yerushalayim. And the
heavens and earth shall shake, but יהוה shall be a
refuge for His people, and a stronghold for the children of Yisra’ĕl. 
Joel
3:17  “Then you shall know that I am יהוה
your Elohim, dwelling in Tsiyon, My set-apart mountain. And Yerushalayim shall
be set-apart, and foreigners shall not pass through her again.
Joel
3:18  “And it shall be in that day that
the mountains drip with new wine, and the hills flow with milk. And all the
streams of Yehuḏah shall be flooded with water, and a fountain flow from
the House of יהוה and water the wadi Shittim. 
Joel
3:19  “Mitsrayim shall become a ruin, and
Eḏom a ruin, a wilderness, because of violence done to the people of Yehuḏah,
whose innocent blood they shed in their land.
Joel
3:20  “But Yehuḏah shall dwell
forever, and Yerushalayim to all generations. 
Joel
3:21  “And I shall avenge their blood,
which I have not avenged. And יהוה shall be dwelling in
Tsiyon!”
