Yehuḏah/Jude
Jude
1:1  Yehuḏah, a servant of יהושע
Messiah, and brother of Ya‛aqoḇ, to those who are called, set-apart
by Elohim the Father, and preserved in יהושע
Messiah: 
Jude
1:2  Compassion, and peace, and love be
increased to you. 
Jude
1:3  Beloved ones, making all haste to
write to you concerning our common deliverance, I felt the necessity to write
to you urging you to earnestly contend for the belief which was once for all
delivered to the set-apart ones. 
Jude
1:4  For certain men have slipped in,
whose judgment was written about long ago, wicked ones perverting the favour of
our Elohim for indecency, and denying the only Master יהוה
and our Master יהושע Messiah.
Jude
1:5  But I intend to remind you, though
you once knew this, that יהוה, having saved a people
out of the land of Mitsrayim, afterward destroyed those who did not believe. 
Jude
1:6  And the messengers who did not keep
their own principality, but left their own dwelling, He has kept in everlasting
shackles under darkness for the judgment of the great day. 
Jude
1:7  Even as Seḏom and Amorah and
the cities around them in a similar way to these, having given themselves over
to whoring and gone after strange flesh, are set forth as an example,
undergoing judicial punishment of everlasting fire. 
Jude
1:8  In the same way, indeed, these
dreamers defile the flesh, and reject authority, and speak evil of esteemed
ones. 
Jude
1:9  But Miḵa’ĕl the chief
messenger, in contending with the devil, when he disputed about the body of
Mosheh, presumed not to bring against him a blasphemous accusation, but said, “
יהוה rebuke you!”
Jude
1:10  But these blaspheme that which they
do not know. And that which they know naturally, like unreasoning beasts, in
these they corrupt themselves. 
Jude
1:11  Woe to them! Because they have gone
in the way of Qayin, and gave themselves to the delusion of Bil‛am for a
reward, and perished in the rebellion of Qoraḥ. 
Jude
1:12  These are rocky reefs in your love
feasts, feasting with you, feeding themselves without fear, waterless clouds
borne about by the winds, late autumn trees without fruit, twice dead, pulled
up by the roots, 
Jude
1:13  wild waves of the sea foaming up
their own shame, straying stars for whom blackness of darkness is kept forever.

Jude
1:14  And Ḥanoḵ, the seventh
from Adam, also prophesied of these, saying, “See, יהוה
comes with His myriads of set-apart ones, 
Jude
1:15  to execute judgment on all, to
punish all who are wicked among them concerning all their wicked works which
they have committed in a wicked way, and concerning all the harsh words which wicked sinners have spoken
against Him.” 
Jude
1:16  These are grumblers, complainers,
who walk according to their own lusts, and their mouth speaks proudly, admiring
faces of others for the sake of gain.

Jude
1:17  But you, beloved ones, remember the
words spoken before by the emissaries of our Master יהושע
Messiah, 
Jude
1:18  because they told you that there
would be mockers in the last time who would walk according to their own wicked
lusts. 
Jude
1:19  These are the ones who cause
divisions, not having the Spirit. 
Jude
1:20  But you, beloved ones, building
yourselves up on your most set-apart belief, praying in the Set-apart Spirit, 
Jude
1:21  keep yourselves in the love of
Elohim, looking for the compassion of our Master יהושע
Messiah unto everlasting life. 
Jude
1:22  And show compassion toward some who
are doubting, 
Jude
1:23  but others save with fear,
snatching them out of the fire, hating, even the garment defiled by the flesh.
Jude
1:24  And to Him who is able to keep you
from stumbling, and to present you blameless before the presence of His esteem
with exceeding joy, 
Jude
1:25  to the only wise Elohim, our
Saviour, be esteem and greatness and might and authority, both now and forever.
Amĕn.
