Eph`siyim/Ephesians
Eph
1:1  Sha’ul, an emissary of יהושע
Messiah by the desire of Elohim, to the set-apart ones who are in Ephesos, and
true to Messiah יהושע : 
Eph
1:2  Favour to you and peace from Elohim
our Father and the Master יהושע Messiah. 
Eph
1:3  Blessed be the Elohim and Father of
our Master יהושע Messiah, who has blessed us with
every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Messiah, 
Eph
1:4  even as He chose us in Him before
the foundation of the world, that we should be set-apart and blameless before
Him in love,
Eph
1:5  having previously ordained us to
adoption as sons through יהושע Messiah to
Himself, according to the good pleasure of His desire, 
Eph
1:6  to the praise of the esteem of His
favour with which He favoured us in the Beloved, 
Eph
1:7  in whom we have redemption through
His blood, the forgiveness of trespasses, according to the riches of His
favour, 
Eph
1:8  which He has lavished on us in all
wisdom and insight, 
Eph
1:9  having made known to us the secret
of His desire, according to His good pleasure which He purposed in Him, 
Eph
1:10  to administer at the completion of
time, to gather together in one all in Messiah, both which are in the heavens
and which are on earth, in Him, 
Eph
1:11  in whom also we did obtain an
inheritance, being previously ordained according to the purpose of Him working
all matters according to the counsel
of His desire, 
Eph
1:12  for us to be the praise of His
esteem – those having first trusted in Messiah, 
Eph
1:13  in whom you also, having heard the
word of the truth, the Good News of your deliverance, in whom also, having
believed, you were sealed with the Set-apart Spirit of promise, 
Eph
1:14  who is the pledge of our
inheritance, until the redemption of the purchased possession, to the praise of
His esteem. 
Eph
1:15  For this reason I too, having heard
of your belief in the Master יהושע and your love
for all the set-apart ones, 
Eph
1:16  do not cease giving thanks for you,
making mention of you in my prayers, 
Eph
1:17  that the Elohim of our Master יהושע
Messiah, the Father of esteem, would give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation
in the knowledge of Him, 
Eph
1:18  the eyes of your understanding
being enlightened, so that you know what is the expectation of His calling, and
what are the riches of the esteem of His inheritance in the set-apart ones,
Eph
1:19  and what is the exceeding greatness
of His power toward us who are believing, according to the working of His
mighty strength, 
Eph
1:20  which He wrought in the Messiah
when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him
at His right hand in the heavenlies, 
Eph
1:21  far above all rule and authority
and power and mastery, and every name that is named, not only in this age but
also in that which is to come. 
Eph
1:22  And He put all under His feet, and
gave Him to be head over all, to the assembly, 
Eph
1:23  which is His body, the completeness
of Him who fills all in all. 
Eph
2:1  And you were dead in trespasses and
sins,
Eph
2:2  in which you once walked according
to the course of this world, according to the ruler of the authority of the
air, of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience,
Eph
2:3  among whom also we all once lived in
the lusts of our flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and
were by nature children of wrath, as also the rest. 
Eph
2:4  But Elohim, who is rich in
compassion, because of His great love with which He loved us, 
Eph
2:5  even when we were dead in
trespasses, made us alive together with Messiah – by favour you have been saved
– 
Eph
2:6  and raised us up together, and made
us sit together in the heavenlies in Messiah יהושע,

Eph
2:7  in order to show in the coming ages
the exceeding riches of His favour in kindness toward us in Messiah יהושע.

Eph
2:8  For by favour you have been saved,
through belief, and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of Elohim, 
Eph
2:9  it is not by works, so that no one
should boast. 
Eph
2:10  For we are His workmanship, created
in Messiah יהושע unto good works, which Elohim
prepared beforehand that we should walk in them. 
Eph
2:11  Therefore remember that you, once
gentiles in the flesh, who are called ‘the uncircumcision’ by what is called ‘the
circumcision’ made in the flesh by hands,
Eph
2:12  that at that time you were without
Messiah, excluded from the citizenship of Yisra’ĕl and strangers from the
covenants of promise, having no expectation and without Elohim in the world. 
Eph
2:13  But now in Messiah יהושע
you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of the Messiah. 
Eph
2:14  For He is our peace, who has made
both one, and having broken down the partition of the barrier, 
Eph
2:15  having abolished in His flesh the
enmity – the Torah of the commands in dogma – so as to create in Himself one
renewed man from the two, thus making peace, 
Eph
2:16  and to completely restore to favour
both of them unto Elohim in one body through the stake, having destroyed the
enmity by it. 
Eph
2:17  And having come, He brought as Good
News peace to you who were far off, and peace to those near. 
Eph
2:18  Because through Him we both have
access to the Father by one Spirit. 
Eph
2:19  So then you are no longer strangers
and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the set-apart ones and members of the
household of Elohim,
Eph
2:20  having been built upon the
foundation of the emissaries and prophets, יהושע
Messiah Himself being chief corner-stone, 
Eph
2:21  in whom all the building, being
joined together, grows into a set-apart Dwelling Place in יהוה,

Eph
2:22  in whom you also are being built
together into a dwelling of Elohim in the Spirit. 
Eph
3:1  Because of this I, Sha’ul, am the prisoner of יהושע
Messiah on behalf of you gentiles – 
Eph
3:2  if indeed you have heard of the
administration of the favour of Elohim that was given to me for you, 
Eph
3:3  that by revelation was made known to
me the secret, as I wrote before briefly. 
Eph
3:4  In reading this, then, you are able
to understand my insight into the secret of Messiah, 
Eph
3:5  which was not made known to the sons
of men in other generations, as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to His
set-apart emissaries and prophets: 
Eph
3:6  The gentiles to be co-heirs, united
in the same body, and partakers together in the promise in Messiah through the
Good News,
Eph
3:7  of which I became a servant
according to the gift of the favour of Elohim given to me, according to the
working of His power. 
Eph
3:8  To me, the very least of all the
set-apart ones, this favour was given, to bring the Good News of the unsearchable
riches of Messiah among the gentiles, 
Eph
3:9  and to make all see how this secret
is administered, which for ages past has been hidden in Elohim who created all
through יהושע Messiah,
Eph
3:10  so that now, through the assembly,
the many-sided wisdom of Elohim might be known to the principalities and
authorities in the heavenlies, 
Eph
3:11  according to the everlasting
purpose which He made in Messiah יהושע our
Master, 
Eph
3:12  in whom we have boldness and
access, with reliance, through belief in Him. 
Eph
3:13  I pray therefore, that you do not
lose heart at my pressures on your behalf, which is your esteem. 
Eph
3:14  For this reason I bow my knees to
the Father of our Master יהושע Messiah, 
Eph
3:15  from whom all fatherhood in the
heavens and earth is named,
Eph
3:16  in order that He might give you,
according to the riches of His esteem by power, to be strengthened in the inner
man, through His Spirit, 
Eph
3:17  that the Messiah might dwell in
your hearts through belief – having become rooted and grounded in love,
Eph
3:18  in order that you might be
strengthened to firmly grasp, with all the set-apart ones, what is the width
and length and depth and height, 
Eph
3:19  to know the love of Messiah which
surpasses knowledge, in order that you might be filled to all the completeness
of Elohim. 
Eph
3:20  And to Him who is able to do
exceedingly above what we ask or think, according to the power that is working
in us, 
Eph
3:21  to Him be esteem in the assembly by
Messiah יהושע unto all generations, for ever and
ever. Amĕn. 
Eph
4:1  I call upon you therefore, I the
prisoner of the Master, to walk worthily of the calling with which you were
called, 
Eph
4:2  with all humility and meekness, with
patience, bearing with one another in love, 
Eph
4:3  being eager to guard the unity of
the Spirit in the bond of peace – 
Eph
4:4  one body and one Spirit, as you also
were called in one expectation of your calling, 
Eph
4:5  one Master, one belief, one
immersion, 
Eph
4:6  one Elohim and Father of all, who is
above all, and through all, and in you all.
Eph
4:7  But to each one of us favour was
given according to the measure of the gift of Messiah. 
Eph
4:8  That is why it says, “When He went
up on high, He led captivity captive, and gave gifts to men.” 
Eph
4:9  But what does “He went up” mean,
except that He also first went down into the lower parts of the earth? 
Eph
4:10  He who went down is also the One
who went up far above all the heavens, to fill all. 
Eph
4:11  And He Himself gave some as
emissaries, and some as prophets, and some as evangelists, and some as
shepherds and teachers 
Eph
4:12  for the perfecting of the set-apart
ones, to the work of service to a building up of the body of the Messiah, 
Eph
4:13  until we all come to the unity of
the belief and of the knowledge of the Son of Elohim, to a perfect man, to the
measure of the stature of the completeness of Messiah, 
Eph
4:14  so that we should no longer be
children, tossed and borne about by every wind of teaching, by the trickery of
men, in cleverness, unto the craftiness of leading astray,
Eph
4:15  but, maintaining the truth in love,
we grow up in all respects into Him who is the head, Messiah, 
Eph
4:16  from whom the entire body, joined
and knit together by what every joint supplies, according to the working by
which each part does its share, causes growth of the body for the building up
of itself in love. 
Eph
4:17  So this I say, and witness in the
Master, that you should no longer walk as the gentiles walk, in the futility of
their mind,
Eph
4:18  having been darkened in their
understanding, having been estranged from the life of Elohim, because of the
ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of their heart, 
Eph
4:19  who, having become callous, have
given themselves up to indecency, to work all uncleanness with greediness. 
Eph
4:20  But you have not so learned
Messiah, 
Eph
4:21  if indeed you have heard Him and
were taught by Him, as truth is in יהושע : 
Eph
4:22  that you put off – with regard to
your former way of life – the old man, being corrupted according to the desires
of the deceit, 
Eph
4:23  and to be renewed in the spirit of
your mind, 
Eph
4:24  and that you put on the renewed man
which was created according to Elohim, in righteousness and set-apartness of
the truth.
Eph
4:25  Therefore, having put off the
false, speak truth, each one with his neighbour, for we are members of one
another. 
Eph
4:26  “Be wroth, but do not sin.” Do not
let the sun go down on your rage, 
Eph
4:27  nor give place to the devil. 
Eph
4:28  Let him who stole steal no more,
but rather let him labour, working with his hands what is good, so that he has somewhat to share with those in need. 
Eph
4:29  Let no corrupt word come out of
your mouth, but only such as is good for the use of building up, so as to
impart what is pleasant to the hearers. 
Eph
4:30  And do not grieve the Set-apart
Spirit of Elohim, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. 
Eph
4:31  Let all bitterness, and wrath, and
displeasure, and uproar, and slander be put away from you, along with all evil.

Eph
4:32  And be kind towards one another,
tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as Elohim also forgave you in Messiah. 
Eph
5:1  Become, then, imitators of Elohim as
beloved children. 
Eph
5:2  And walk in love, as Messiah also
has loved us, and gave Himself for us, a gift and an offering to Elohim for a
sweet-smelling fragrance. 
Eph
5:3  But whoring and all uncleanness, or
greed of gain, let it not even be named among you, as is proper among set-apart
ones – 
Eph
5:4  neither filthiness, nor foolish
talking, nor coarse jesting, which are not fitting, but rather thanksgiving. 
Eph
5:5  For this you know, that no one who
whores, nor unclean one, nor one greedy of gain, who is an idolater, has any
inheritance in the reign of Messiah and Elohim. 
Eph
5:6  Let no one deceive you with empty
words, for because of these the wrath of Elohim comes upon the sons of
disobedience.
Eph
5:7  Therefore do not become partakers
with them. 
Eph
5:8  For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Master. Walk as
children of light –
Eph
5:9  for the fruit of the Spirit is in
all goodness, and righteousness, and truth –
Eph
5:10  proving what is well-pleasing to
the Master. 
Eph
5:11  And have no fellowship with the
fruitless works of darkness, but rather reprove them.
Eph
5:12  For it is a shame even to speak of
what is done by them in secret. 
Eph
5:13  But all matters being reproved are manifested by the light, for whatever is
manifested is light.
Eph
5:14  That is why He says, “Wake up, you
who sleep, and arise from the dead, and Messiah shall shine on you.” 
Eph
5:15  See then that you walk exactly, not
as unwise, but as wise, 
Eph
5:16  redeeming the time, because the
days are wicked. 
Eph
5:17  So then do not be foolish, but
understand what the desire of יהוה is. 
Eph
5:18  And do not be drunk with wine, in
which is loose behaviour, but be filled with the Spirit, 
Eph
5:19  speaking to each other in psalms
and songs of praise and spiritual songs, singing and striking the strings in
your heart to the Master, 
Eph
5:20  giving thanks always for all to
Elohim the Father, in the Name of our Master יהושע
Messiah, 
Eph
5:21  subjecting yourselves to each other
in the fear of Elohim.
Eph
5:22  Wives, subject yourselves to your
own husbands, as to the Master. 
Eph
5:23  Because the husband is head of the
wife, as also the Messiah is head of the assembly, and He is Saviour of the
body. 
Eph
5:24  But as the assembly is subject to
Messiah, so also let the wives be to their own husbands in every respect. 
Eph
5:25  Husbands, love your wives, as
Messiah also did love the assembly and gave Himself for it, 
Eph
5:26  in order to set it apart and
cleanse it with the washing of water by the Word,
Eph
5:27  in order to present it to Himself a
splendid assembly, not having spot or wrinkle or any of this sort, but that it
might be set-apart and blameless. 
Eph
5:28  In this way husbands ought to love
their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. 
Eph
5:29  For no one ever hated his own
flesh, but feeds and cherishes it, as also the Master does the assembly. 
Eph
5:30  Because we are members of His body,
of His flesh and of His bones. 
Eph
5:31  “For this cause a man shall leave
his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one
flesh.” 
Eph
5:32  This secret is great, but I speak
concerning Messiah and the assembly. 
Eph
5:33  However, you too, everyone, let
each one love his own wife as himself, and let the wife see that she fears her
husband. 
Eph
6:1  Children, obey your parents in the
Master, for this is right. 
Eph
6:2  “Respect your father and mother,”
which is the first command with promise, 
Eph
6:3  in order that it might be well with
you, and you might live long on the earth.” 
Eph
6:4  And you, fathers, do not provoke
your children, but bring them up in the instruction and admonition of the
Master. 
Eph
6:5  Servants, obey your masters
according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in sincerity of heart, as to
Messiah; 
Eph
6:6  not with eye-service as
men-pleasers, but as servants of Messiah, doing the desire of Elohim from the
inner self,
Eph
6:7  rendering service with pleasure, as
to the Master, and not to men, 
Eph
6:8  knowing that whatever good anyone
does, he shall receive the same from the Master, whether he is slave or free. 
Eph
6:9  And, masters, do the same to them,
refrain from threatening, knowing that your own Master also is in the heavens,
and there is no partiality with Him. 
Eph
6:10  For the rest, my brothers, be
strong in the Master and in the mightiness of His strength. 
Eph
6:11  Put on the complete armour of
Elohim, for you to have power to stand against the schemes of the devil. 
Eph
6:12  Because we do not wrestle against
flesh and blood, but against principalities, against authorities, against the
world-rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual matters of wickedness in the heavenlies.

Eph
6:13  Because of this, take up the
complete armour of Elohim, so that you have power to withstand in the wicked
day, and having done all, to stand. 
Eph
6:14  Stand, then, having girded your
waist with truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness, 
Eph
6:15  and having fitted your feet with
the preparation of the Good News of peace; 
Eph
6:16  above all, having taken up the
shield of belief with which you shall have power to quench all the burning
arrows of the wicked one. 
Eph
6:17  Take also the helmet of
deliverance, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of Elohim,
Eph
6:18  praying at all times, with all
prayer and supplication in the Spirit, watching in all perseverance and
supplication for all the set-apart ones; 
Eph
6:19  also for me, that a word might be
given to me in the opening of my mouth, to be bold in making known the secret
of the Good News, 
Eph
6:20  for which I am an envoy in chains,
that in it I might speak boldly, as I should speak. 
Eph
6:21  Now, in order that you also might
know about me, how I am doing, Tuchikos, a beloved brother and trustworthy
servant in the Master, shall make all matters
known to you, 
Eph
6:22  whom I did send to you for this
same purpose, so that you know about us, and might encourage your hearts. 
Eph
6:23  Peace to the brothers, and love,
with belief, from Elohim the Father and the Master יהושע
Messiah. 
Eph
6:24  Favour be with all those who love
our Master יהושע Messiah, undecayingly! Amĕn.
