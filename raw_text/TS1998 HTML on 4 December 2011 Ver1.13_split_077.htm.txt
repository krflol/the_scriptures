Ḥazon/Revelation
Rev
1:1  Revelation of יהושע
Messiah, which Elohim gave Him to show His servants what has to take place with
speed. And He signified it by sending His messenger to His servant
Yoḥanan, 
Rev
1:2  who bore witness to the Word of Elohim,
and the witness of יהושע Messiah – to all he saw.

Rev
1:3  Blessed is he who reads and those
who hear the words of this prophecy, and guard what is written in it, for the
time is near. 
Rev
1:4  Yoḥanan, to the seven
assemblies that are in Asia: Favour to you and peace from Him who is and who
was and who is coming, and from the seven Spirits that are before His throne, 
Rev
1:5  and from יהושע
Messiah, the trustworthy witness, the first-born from the dead, and the ruler
of the sovereigns of the earth. To Him who loved us and washed us from our sins
in His own blood, 
Rev
1:6  and has made us sovereigns and
priests to His Elohim and Father, to Him be esteem and rule forever and ever.
Amĕn. 
Rev
1:7  See, He is coming with the clouds,
and every eye shall see Him, even they who pierced Him. And all the tribes of
the earth shall mourn because of Him. Yes, Amĕn. 
Rev
1:8  “I am the ‘Aleph’ and the ‘Taw’,
Beginning and End,” says יהוה “who is and who was and
who is to come, the Almighty.” 
Rev
1:9  I, Yoḥanan, both your brother
and co-sharer in pressure, and in the reign and endurance of יהושע
Messiah, came to be on the island that is called Patmos for the Word of Elohim
and for the witness of יהושע Messiah. 
Rev
1:10  I came to be in the Spirit on the
Day of יהוה, and I heard behind me a loud voice, as of
a trumpet, 
Rev
1:11  saying, “I am the ‘Aleph’ and the ‘Taw’,
the First and the Last,” and, “Write in a book what you see and send it to the
seven assemblies of Asia – to Ephesos, and to Smurna, and to Pergamos, and to
Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodikeia.” 
Rev
1:12  And I turned to see the voice which
spoke with me. And having turned, I saw seven golden lampstands,
Rev
1:13  and in the midst of the seven
lampstands One like the Son of Aḏam, dressed in a robe down to the feet
and girded about the chest with a golden band.
Rev
1:14  And His head and hair were white as
white wool, as snow, and His eyes as a flame of fire, 
Rev
1:15  and His feet like burnished brass,
as if refined in a furnace, and His voice as the sound of many waters.
Rev
1:16  And in His right hand He held seven
stars, and out of His mouth went a sharp two-edged sword, and His face was as
the sun shining in its strength.
Rev
1:17  And when I saw Him, I fell at His
feet as dead, and He placed His right hand on me, saying, “Do not be afraid, I
am the First and the Last,
Rev
1:18  and the living One. And I became
dead, and see, I am living forever and ever. Amĕn. And I possess the keys
of the grave and of death. 
Rev
1:19  “Write therefore what you have
seen, both what is now and what shall take place after these: 
Rev
1:20  “The secret of the seven stars
which you saw in My right hand, and the seven golden lampstands: The seven
stars are messengers of the seven assemblies, and the seven lampstands which
you saw are seven assemblies. 
Rev
2:1  “To the messenger of the assembly of
Ephesos write, ‘He who is holding the seven stars in His right hand, who is
walking in the midst of the seven golden lampstands, says this: 
Rev
2:2  “I know your works, and your labour,
and your endurance, and that you are not able to bear evil ones, and have tried
those who say they are emissaries and are not, and have found them false; 
Rev
2:3  and you have been bearing up and
have endurance, and have laboured for My Name’s sake and have not become weary.

Rev
2:4  “But I hold this against you, that
you have left your first love. 
Rev
2:5  “So remember from where you have
fallen, and repent and do the first works, or else I shall come to you speedily
and remove your lampstand from its place, unless you repent. 
Rev
2:6  “Yet this you have, that you hate
the works of the Nikolaites, which I also hate. 
Rev
2:7  “He who has an ear, let him hear
what the Spirit says to the assemblies. To him who overcomes I shall give to
eat from the tree of life, which is in the midst of the Paradise of Elohim.” ’
Rev
2:8  “And to the messenger of the
assembly in Smurna write, ‘This says the First and the Last, who became dead,
and came to life: 
Rev
2:9  “I know your works, and pressure,
and poverty – yet you are rich – and the blasphemy of those who say they are
Yehuḏim and are not, but are a congregation of Satan. 
Rev
2:10  “Do not be afraid of what you are
about to suffer. See, the devil is about to throw some of you into prison, in
order to try you, and you shall have pressure ten days. Be trustworthy until
death, and I shall give you the crown of life. 
Rev
2:11  “He who has an ear, let him hear
what the Spirit says to the assemblies. He who overcomes shall by no means be
harmed by the second death.” ’
Rev
2:12  “And to the messenger of the
assembly in Pergamos write, ‘He who has the sharp two-edged sword, says this: 
Rev
2:13  “I know your works, and where you
dwell, where the throne of Satan is. And you hold fast to My Name, and did not
deny the belief in Me, even in the days in which Antipas was My trustworthy
witness, who was killed near you, where Satan dwells. 
Rev
2:14  “But I hold a few matters against you, because you have
there those who adhere to the teaching of Bil‛am, who taught Balaq to put
a stumbling-block before the children of Yisra’ĕl, to eat food offered to idols, and to commit
whoring. 
Rev
2:15  “So you also have those who adhere
to the teaching of the Nikolaites, which teaching
I hate. 
Rev
2:16  “Repent, or else I shall come to
you speedily and fight against them with the sword of My mouth. 
Rev
2:17  “He who has an ear, let him hear
what the Spirit says to the assemblies. To him who overcomes I shall give some
of the hidden manna to eat. And I shall give him a white stone, and on the
stone a renewed Name written which no one knows except him who receives it.” ’ 
Rev
2:18  “And to the messenger of the
assembly in Thyatira write, ‘This says the Son of Elohim, who has eyes like a
flame of fire, and His feet like burnished brass:
Rev
2:19  “I know your works, and love, and
service, and belief, and your endurance. And as for your works, the last are
more than the first. 
Rev
2:20  “But I hold against you that you
allow that woman Izeḇel, who calls herself a prophetess, to teach and
lead My servants astray to commit whoring and to eat food offered to idols. 
Rev
2:21  “And I gave her time to repent of
her whoring, and she did not repent. 
Rev
2:22  “See, I am throwing her into a
sickbed, and those who commit adultery with her into great affliction, unless
they repent of their works. 
Rev
2:23  “And I shall slay her children with
death. And all the assemblies shall know that I am the One searching the
kidneys and hearts. And I shall give to each one of you according to your
works. 
Rev
2:24  “And to you I say, and to the rest
in Thyatira, as many as do not possess this teaching, and who have not known
the depths of Satan, as they call them, I am not putting on you another burden.

Rev
2:25  “But hold fast what you have until
I come. 
Rev
2:26  “And he who overcomes, and guards
My works until the end, to him I shall give authority over the nations,
Rev
2:27  and he shall shepherd them with a
rod of iron, as the potter’s vessels shall be broken to pieces, as I also have
received from My Father.
Rev
2:28  “And I shall give him the morning
star. 
Rev
2:29  “He who has an ear, let him hear
what the Spirit says to the assemblies.” ’ 
Rev
3:1  “And to the messenger of the assembly
in Sardis write, ‘He who has the seven Spirits of Elohim and the seven stars,
says this, “I know your works, that you have a name that you are alive, but you
are dead. 
Rev
3:2  “Wake up, and strengthen what
remains and is about to die, for I have not found your works complete before
Elohim. 
Rev
3:3  “Remember, then, how you have
received, and heard. And watch and repent. If, then, you do not wake up, I
shall come upon you as a thief, and you shall not know at all what hour I come
upon you. 
Rev
3:4  “Nevertheless, you have a few names
in Sardis who have not defiled their garments. And they shall walk with Me in
white, because they are worthy. 
Rev
3:5  “He who overcomes shall be dressed
in white robes, and I shall by no means blot out his name from the Book of
Life, but I shall confess his name before My Father and before His messengers. 
Rev
3:6  “He who has an ear, let him hear
what the Spirit says to the assemblies.” ’ 
Rev
3:7  “And to the messenger of the
assembly in Philadelphia write, ‘He who is set-apart, He who is true, He who
has the key of Dawiḏ, He who opens and no one shuts, and shuts and no one
opens, says this: 
Rev
3:8  “I know your works – see, I have set
before you an open door, and no one is able to shut it – that you have little
power, yet have guarded My Word, and have not denied My Name.
Rev
3:9  “See, I am giving up those of the
congregation of Satan, who say they are Yehuḏim and are not, but lie.
See, I am making them come and worship before your feet, and to know that I
have loved you. 
Rev
3:10  “Because you have guarded My Word
of endurance, I also shall guard you from the hour of trial which shall come
upon all the world, to try those who dwell on the earth. 
Rev
3:11  “See, I am coming speedily! Hold
what you have that no one take your crown. 
Rev
3:12  “He who overcomes, I shall make him
a supporting post in the Dwelling Place of My Elohim, and he shall by no means
go out. And I shall write on him the Name of My Elohim and the name of the city
of My Elohim, the renewed Yerushalayim, which comes down out of the heaven from
My Elohim, and My renewed Name.
Rev
3:13  “He who has an ear, let him hear
what the Spirit says to the assemblies.” ’ 
Rev
3:14  “And to the messenger of the
assembly in Laodikeia write, ‘The Amĕn, the Trustworthy and True Witness,
the Beginning of the creation of Elohim, says this:
Rev
3:15  “I know your works, that you are
neither cold nor hot. I would that you were cold or hot. 
Rev
3:16  “So, because you are lukewarm, and
neither cold nor hot, I am going to vomit you out of My mouth. 
Rev
3:17  “Because you say, ‘Rich I am, and I
am made rich, and need none at all,’ and do not know that you are wretched, and
pitiable, and poor, and blind, and naked. 
Rev
3:18  “I advise you to buy from Me gold
refined in the fire, so that you become rich; and white garments, so that you
become dressed, so that the shame of your nakedness might not be shown; and
anoint your eyes with ointment, so that you see.
Rev
3:19  “As many as I love, I reprove and
discipline. So be ardent and repent. 
Rev
3:20  “See, I stand at the door and
knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I shall come in to him and
dine with him, and he with Me. 
Rev
3:21  “To him who overcomes I shall give
to sit with Me on My throne, as I also overcame and sat down with My Father on
His throne. 
Rev
3:22  “He who has an ear, let him hear
what the Spirit says to the assemblies.” ’ ” 
Rev
4:1  After this I looked and saw a door
having been opened in the heaven. And the first voice which I heard was like a
trumpet speaking with me, saying, “Come up here and I shall show you what has
to take place after this.” 
Rev
4:2  And immediately I came to be in the
Spirit and saw a throne set in the heaven, and One sat on the throne. 
Rev
4:3  And He who sat there was like a
jasper and a ruby stone in appearance. And there was a rainbow around the
throne, like an emerald in appearance. 
Rev
4:4  And around the throne were
twenty-four thrones, and on the thrones I saw twenty-four elders sitting,
dressed in white robes. And they had crowns of gold on their heads. 
Rev
4:5  And out of the throne came
lightnings, and thunders, and voices. And seven lamps of fire were burning
before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of Elohim. 
Rev
4:6  And before the throne there was a
sea of glass, like crystal. And in the midst of the throne, and around the
throne, were four living creatures, covered with eyes in front and in back. 
Rev
4:7  And the first living creature was
like a lion, and the second living creature like a calf, and the third living
creature had a face like a man, and the fourth living creature was like a
flying eagle.
Rev
4:8  And the four living creatures, each
having six wings, were covered with eyes around and within. And they do not
cease, day or night, saying, “Set-apart, set-apart, set-apart, יהוה
Ĕl Shaddai, who was, and who is, and who is coming!” 
Rev
4:9  And when the living creatures give
esteem and respect and thanks to Him who sits on the throne, who lives forever
and ever, 
Rev
4:10  the twenty-four elders fall down
before Him who sits on the throne and bow before Him who lives forever and
ever, and they cast their crowns before the throne, saying, 
Rev
4:11  “You are worthy, O יהוה,
to receive esteem and respect and power, for You have created all, and because
of Your desire they are, and were created.” 
Rev
5:1  And I saw in the right hand of Him
who sat on the throne a scroll written inside and on the back, having been
sealed with seven seals. 
Rev
5:2  And I saw a strong messenger proclaiming
with a loud voice, “Who is worthy to open the scroll and to loosen its seals?” 
Rev
5:3  And no one in the heaven or on the
earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll, or to look at it. 
Rev
5:4  And I wept much, because no one was
found worthy to open and read the scroll, or to look at it. 
Rev
5:5  And one of the elders said to me, “Do
not weep. See, the Lion of the tribe of Yehuḏah, the Root of Dawiḏ,
overcame to open the scroll and to loosen its seven seals.”
Rev
5:6  And I looked and saw in the midst of
the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders a
Lamb standing, as having been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which
are the seven Spirits of Elohim sent out into all the earth. 
Rev
5:7  And He came and took the scroll out
of the right hand of Him sitting on the throne. 
Rev
5:8  And when He took the scroll, the
four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb,
each holding a harp, and golden bowls filled with incense, which are the
prayers of the set-apart ones. 
Rev
5:9  And they sang a renewed song,
saying, “You are worthy to take the scroll, and to open its seals, because You
were slain, and have redeemed us to Elohim by Your blood out of every tribe and
tongue and people and nation,
Rev
5:10  and made us sovereigns and priests
to our Elohim, and we shall reign upon the earth.”
Rev
5:11  And I looked, and I heard the voice
of many messengers around the throne, and the living creatures, and the elders.
And the number of them was myriads of myriads, and thousands of thousands, 
Rev
5:12  saying with a loud voice, “Worthy
is the Lamb having been slain to receive power and riches and wisdom, and
strength and respect and esteem and blessing!” 
Rev
5:13  And every creature which is in the
heaven and on the earth and under the earth and such as are in the sea, and all
that are in them, I heard saying, “To Him sitting on the throne, and to the
Lamb, be the blessing and the respect and the esteem and the might, forever and
ever!” 
Rev
5:14  And the four living creatures said,
“Amĕn!” And the twenty-four elders fell down and bowed before Him who
lives forever and ever. 
Rev
6:1  And I saw when the Lamb opened one
of the seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures saying, like a sound
of thunder, “Come and see.” 
Rev
6:2  And I looked and saw a white horse ,
and he who sat on it holding a bow. And a crown was given to him, and he went
out overcoming and to overcome. 
Rev
6:3  And when He opened the second seal,
I heard the second living creature saying, “Come and see.” 
Rev
6:4  And another horse, fiery red, went
out. And it was given to the one who sat on it to take peace from the earth,
and that they should slay one another. And a great sword was given to him. 
Rev
6:5  And when He opened the third seal, I
heard the third living creature say, “Come and see.” And I looked and saw a
black horse, and he who sat on it holding a pair of scales in his hand.
Rev
6:6  And I heard a voice in the midst of
the four living creatures saying, “A quart of wheat for a day’s wage, and three
quarts of barley for a day’s wage. And do not harm the oil and the wine.” 
Rev
6:7  And when He opened the fourth seal,
I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, “Come and see.” 
Rev
6:8  And I looked and saw a pale horse.
And he who sat on it had the name Death, and the grave followed with him. And
authority was given to them over a fourth of the earth, to kill with sword, and
with hunger, and with death, and by the beasts of the earth.
Rev
6:9  And when He opened the fifth seal, I
saw under the altar the beings of those having been slain for the Word of
Elohim and for the witness which they held, 
Rev
6:10  and they cried with a loud voice,
saying, “How long, O Master, set-apart and true, until You judge and avenge our
blood on those who dwell on the earth?” 
Rev
6:11  And there was given to each one a
white robe, and they were told that they should rest a little while longer,
until both the number of their fellow
servants and their brothers, who would be killed as they were, was completed. 
Rev
6:12  And I looked when He opened the
sixth seal and saw a great earthquake came to be. And the sun became black as
sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood. 
Rev
6:13  And the stars of the heaven fell to
the earth, as a fig tree drops its unripe figs, being shaken by a strong wind. 
Rev
6:14  And heaven departed like a scroll
being rolled up, and every mountain and island was moved out of its place. 
Rev
6:15  And the sovereigns of the earth,
and the great ones, and the rich ones, and the commanders, and the mighty, and
every slave and every free one, hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of
the mountains, 
Rev
6:16  and said to the mountains and
rocks, “Fall on us and hide us from the face of Him sitting on the throne and
from the wrath of the Lamb, 
Rev
6:17  because the great day of His wrath
has come, and who is able to stand?” 
Rev
7:1  And after this I saw four messengers
standing at the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth,
that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree. 
Rev
7:2  And I saw another messenger coming
up from the rising of the sun, holding the seal of the living Elohim. And he
cried with a loud voice to the four messengers to whom it was given to harm the
earth and the sea, 
Rev
7:3  saying, “Do not harm the earth, nor
the sea, nor the trees until we have sealed the servants of our Elohim upon
their foreheads.”
Rev
7:4  And I heard the number of those who
were sealed, one hundred and forty-four thousand, sealed out of all the tribes
of the children of Yisra’ĕl: 
Rev
7:5  of the tribe of Yehuḏah twelve
thousand were sealed, of the tribe of Re’uḇĕn twelve thousand were
sealed, of the tribe of Gaḏ twelve thousand were sealed, 
Rev
7:6  of the tribe of Ashĕr twelve
thousand were sealed, of the tribe of Naphtali twelve thousand were sealed, of
the tribe of Menashsheh twelve thousand were sealed, 
Rev
7:7  of the tribe of Shim‛on twelve
thousand were sealed, of the tribe of Lĕwi twelve thousand were sealed, of
the tribe of Yissasḵar twelve thousand were sealed, 
Rev
7:8  of the tribe of Zeḇulun twelve
thousand were sealed, of the tribe of Yosĕph twelve thousand were sealed,
of the tribe of Binyamin twelve thousand were sealed. 
Rev
7:9  After this I looked and saw a great
crowd which no one was able to count, out of all nations and tribes and peoples
and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, dressed in white
robes, and palm branches in their hands, 
Rev
7:10  and crying out with a loud voice,
saying, “Deliverance belongs to our Elohim who sits on the throne, and to the
Lamb!” 
Rev
7:11  And all the messengers stood around
the throne and the elders and the four living creatures, and fell on their
faces before the throne and worshipped Elohim, 
Rev
7:12  saying, “Amĕn! The blessing,
and the esteem, and the wisdom, and the thanksgiving, and the respect, and the
power, and the might, to our Elohim forever and ever. Amĕn.” 
Rev
7:13  And one of the elders responded,
saying to me, “Who are these dressed in white robes, and where did they come
from?” 
Rev
7:14  And I said to him, “Master, you
know.” And he said to me, “These are those coming out of the great distress,
having washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. 
Rev
7:15  “Because of this they are before
the throne of Elohim, and serve Him day and night in His Dwelling Place. And He
who sits on the throne shall spread His
Tent over them. 
Rev
7:16  “They shall hunger no more, neither
thirst any more, neither shall the sun strike them, nor any heat,
Rev
7:17  because the Lamb who is in the
midst of the throne shall shepherd them and lead them to fountains of waters of
life. And Elohim shall wipe away every tear from their eyes.”
Rev
8:1  And when He opened the seventh seal,
there came to be silence in the heaven for about half an hour. 
Rev
8:2  And I saw the seven messengers who
stand before Elohim, and to them were given seven trumpets. 
Rev
8:3  And another messenger came and stood
at the altar, holding a golden censer, and much incense was given to him, that
he should offer it with the prayers of all the set-apart ones upon the golden
altar which was before the throne. 
Rev
8:4  And the smoke of the incense, with
the prayers of the set-apart ones, went up before Elohim from the hand of the
messenger. 
Rev
8:5  And the messenger took the censer,
and filled it with fire from the altar, and threw it to the earth. And there
were noises, and thunders, and lightnings, and an earthquake. 
Rev
8:6  And the seven messengers who held
the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound. 
Rev
8:7  And the first messenger sounded, and
there came to be hail and fire mixed with blood, and they were thrown to the
earth. And a third of the trees were burned up, and all green grass was burned
up. 
Rev
8:8  And the second messenger sounded,
and what looked like a great mountain
burning with fire was thrown into the sea, and a third of the sea became blood,

Rev
8:9  and a third of the living creatures
in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed. 
Rev
8:10  And the third messenger sounded,
and a great star fell from the heaven, burning like a torch, and it fell on a
third of the rivers and on the fountains of water, 
Rev
8:11  and the name of the star is called
Wormwood. And a third of the waters became wormwood, and many men died from the
waters, because they were made bitter. 
Rev
8:12  And the fourth messenger sounded,
and a third of the sun was struck, and a third of the moon, and a third of the
stars, so that a third of them were darkened. And a third of the day did not
shine, and likewise the night.
Rev
8:13  And I looked, and I heard an eagle
flying in mid-heaven, crying with a loud voice, “Woe, woe, woe to those dwelling
upon the earth, because of the remaining blasts of the trumpet of the three
messengers who are about to sound!” 
Rev
9:1  And the fifth messenger sounded, and
I saw a star from the heaven which had fallen to the earth. And the key to the
pit of the deep was given to it. 
Rev
9:2  And he opened the pit of the deep,
and smoke went up out of the pit like the smoke of a great furnace. And the sun
was darkened, also the air, because of the smoke of the pit. 
Rev
9:3  And out of the smoke locusts came
upon the earth, and authority was given to them as the scorpions of the earth
possess authority. 
Rev
9:4  And it was said to them that they
shall not harm the grass of the earth, or any green matter, or any tree, but only those men who do not have the seal of
Elohim upon their foreheads. 
Rev
9:5  And it was given to them that they
should not kill them, but to torture them for five months. And their torture
was like the torture of a scorpion when it stings a man. 
Rev
9:6  And in those days men shall seek
death and shall not find it. And they shall long to die, but death shall flee
from them. 
Rev
9:7  And the locusts looked like horses
prepared for battle, and on their heads were crowns like gold, and their faces
were like the faces of men. 
Rev
9:8  And they had hair like women’s hair,
and their teeth were like lions’ teeth. 
Rev
9:9  And they had breastplates like
breastplates of iron, and the sound of their wings was like the sound of
chariots of many horses running into battle. 
Rev
9:10  And they have tails like scorpions,
and stings. And in their tails is their authority to harm men five months. 
Rev
9:11  And they have over them a
sovereign, the messenger of the pit of the deep, whose name in Heḇrew is
Abaddon, but in Greek he has the name Apolluon. 
Rev
9:12  The first woe is past. See, two
woes are still coming after this. 
Rev
9:13  And the sixth messenger sounded,
and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before
Elohim, 
Rev
9:14  saying to the sixth messenger who
had the trumpet, “Release the four messengers, those having been bound at the
great river Euphrates.” 
Rev
9:15  And the four messengers, those
having been prepared for the hour and day and month and year, were released to
kill a third of mankind. 
Rev
9:16  And the number of the armies of the
horsemen was two hundred million, and I heard the number of them. 
Rev
9:17  And this is how I saw the horses in
the vision and those who sat on them, having breastplates of fiery red, and
hyacinth blue, and sulphur yellow. And the heads of the horses were like the
heads of lions, and out of their mouths came fire, and smoke, and sulphur. 
Rev
9:18  A third of mankind was killed by
these three plagues, by the fire and
the smoke and the sulphur which came out of their mouths. 
Rev
9:19  For the authority of the horses is
in their mouth and in their tails, for their tails are like serpents, having
heads. And with them they do harm. 
Rev
9:20  And the rest of mankind, who were
not killed by these plagues, did not repent of the works of their hands, that
they should not worship the demons, and idols of gold, and of silver, and of
brass, and of stone, and of wood, which are neither able to see, nor to hear,
nor to walk.
Rev
9:21  And they did not repent of their
murders, nor of their drug sorceries, nor of their whoring, nor of their
thefts. 
Rev
10:1  And I saw another strong messenger
coming down from the heaven, robed in a cloud, and a rainbow on his head, and
his face was like the sun, and his feet like columns of fire, 
Rev
10:2  and having in his hand a little
book opened. And he placed his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the
land, 
Rev
10:3  and cried with a loud voice, as
when a lion roars. And when he cried out, seven thunders spoke their sounds. 
Rev
10:4  And when the seven thunders spoke
their sounds, I was about to write, but I heard a voice from the heaven saying
to me, “Seal up what the seven thunders spoke, and do not write them.” 
Rev
10:5  And the messenger whom I saw
standing on the sea and on the land lifted up his right hand to the heaven,
Rev
10:6  and swore by Him who lives forever
and ever, who created the heaven and what is in it, the earth and what is in
it, and the sea and what is in it, that there shall be no further delay, 
Rev
10:7  but in the days of the sounding of
the seventh messenger, when he is about to sound, the secret of Elohim shall
also be ended, as He declared to His servants the prophets. 
Rev
10:8  And the voice which I heard out of
the heaven spoke to me again and said, “Go, take the little book which is
opened in the hand of the messenger standing on the sea and on the earth.” 
Rev
10:9  And I went to the messenger and
said to him, “Give me the little book.” And he said to me, “Take and eat it,
and it shall make your stomach bitter, but it shall be as sweet as honey in
your mouth.”
Rev
10:10  And I took the little book out of
the messenger’s hand and ate it, and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth, but
when I had eaten it, my stomach was made bitter. 
Rev
10:11  And he said to me, “You have to
prophesy again concerning many peoples and nations and tongues and sovereigns.”

Rev
11:1  And a reed like a measuring rod was
given to me, and the messenger stood, saying, “Rise and measure the Dwelling
Place of Elohim, and the altar, and those worshipping in it. 
Rev
11:2  “But cast out the court which is
outside the Dwelling Place, and do not measure it, for it has been given to the
gentiles, and they shall trample the set-apart city under foot for forty-two
months. 
Rev
11:3  “And I shall give unto my two
witnesses, and they shall prophesy one thousand two hundred and sixty days,
clad in sackcloth.” 
Rev
11:4  These are the two olive trees and
the two lampstands that are standing before the Elohim of the earth. 
Rev
11:5  And if anyone wishes to harm them,
fire comes out from their mouth and consumes their enemies. And if anyone
wishes to harm them, he has to be killed in that way. 
Rev
11:6  These possess authority to shut the
heaven, so that no rain falls in the days of their prophecy. And they possess
authority over waters to turn them to blood, and to smite the earth with all
plagues, as often as they wish. 
Rev
11:7  And when they have ended their
witness, the beast coming up out of the pit of the deep shall fight against
them, and overcome them, and kill them, 
Rev
11:8  and their dead bodies lie in the street of the great city
which spiritually is called Seḏom and Mitsrayim, where also our Master
was impaled, 
Rev
11:9  and some of the peoples and tribes
and tongues and nations see their dead bodies for three and a half days, and
not allow their dead bodies to be placed into tombs, 
Rev
11:10  and those dwelling on the earth
rejoice over them and exult. And they shall send gifts to each other, because
these two prophets tortured those dwelling on the earth. 
Rev
11:11  And after the three and a half
days a spirit of life from Elohim entered into them, and they stood upon their
feet, and great fear fell on those who saw them. 
Rev
11:12  And they heard a loud voice from
the heaven saying to them, “Come up here.” And they went up into the heaven in
a cloud, and their enemies saw them. 
Rev
11:13  And in that hour there came to be
a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell. And in the earthquake seven
thousand men were killed, and the rest became afraid and gave esteem to the
Elohim of the heaven. 
Rev
11:14  The second woe is past, and see,
the third woe is coming speedily. 
Rev
11:15  And the seventh messenger sounded,
and there came to be loud voices in the heaven, saying, “The reign of this
world has become the reign of our
Master, and of His Messiah, and He shall reign forever and ever!”
Rev
11:16  And the twenty-four elders sitting
before Elohim on their thrones fell on their faces and worshipped Elohim, 
Rev
11:17  saying, “We give You thanks, O יהוה
Ĕl Shaddai, the One who is and who was and who is coming, because You have
taken Your great power and reigned. 
Rev
11:18  “And the nations were enraged, and
Your wrath has come, and the time of the dead to be judged, and to give the
reward to Your servants the prophets and to the set-apart ones, and to those
who fear Your Name, small and great, and to destroy those who destroy the
earth.” 
Rev
11:19  And the Dwelling Place of Elohim
was opened in the heaven, and the ark of His covenant was seen in His Dwelling
Place. And there came to be lightnings, and voices, and thunders, and an
earthquake, and great hail. 
Rev
12:1  And a great sign was seen in the
heaven: a woman clad with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head
a crown of twelve stars. 
Rev
12:2  And being pregnant, she cried out
in labour and in pain to give birth.
Rev
12:3  And another sign was seen in the
heaven: and see, a great, fiery red dragon having seven heads and ten horns,
and seven crowns on his heads. 
Rev
12:4  And his tail draws a third of the
stars of the heaven and throws them to the earth. And the dragon stood before
the woman who was about to give birth, to devour her child as soon as it was
born.
Rev
12:5  And she bore a male child who was
to shepherd all nations with a rod of iron. And her child was caught away to
Elohim and to His throne.
Rev
12:6  And the woman fled into the
wilderness, where she has a place prepared by Elohim, to be nourished there one
thousand two hundred and sixty days. 
Rev
12:7  And there came to be fighting in
the heaven: Miḵa’ĕl and his messengers fought against the dragon.
And the dragon and his messengers fought, 
Rev
12:8  but they were not strong enough,
nor was a place found for them in the heaven any longer. 
Rev
12:9  And the great dragon was thrown
out, that serpent of old, called the Devil and Satan, who leads all the world
astray. He was thrown to the earth, and his messengers were thrown out with
him. 
Rev
12:10  And I heard a loud voice saying in
the heaven, “Now have come the deliverance and the power and the reign of our
Elohim, and the authority of His Messiah, for the accuser of our brothers, who
accused them before our Elohim day and night, has been thrown down.
Rev
12:11  “And they overcame him because of
the Blood of the Lamb, and because of the Word of their witness, and they did
not love their lives to the death. 
Rev
12:12  “Because of this rejoice, O
heavens, and you who dwell in them! Woe to the earth and the sea, because the
devil has come down to you, having great wrath, knowing that he has little
time.” 
Rev
12:13  And when the dragon saw that he
had been thrown to the earth, he persecuted the woman who gave birth to the
male child. 
Rev
12:14  And the woman was given two wings
of a great eagle, to fly into the wilderness to her place, where she is
nourished for a time and times and half a time, from the presence of the
serpent. 
Rev
12:15  And out of his mouth the serpent
spewed water like a river after the woman, to cause her to be swept away by the
river. 
Rev
12:16  And the earth helped the woman,
and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed up the river which the dragon had
spewed out of his mouth. 
Rev
12:17  And the dragon was enraged with
the woman, and he went to fight with the remnant of her seed, those guarding
the commands of Elohim and possessing the witness of יהושע
Messiah. 
Rev
13:1  And I stood on the sand of the sea.
And I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns,
and on his horns ten crowns, and on his heads names of blasphemy. 
Rev
13:2  And the beast I saw was like a
leopard, and his feet were like the feet of a bear, and his mouth like the
mouth of a lion. And the dragon gave him his power, and his throne, and great
authority. 
Rev
13:3  And I saw one of his heads, as
having been slain to death, and his deadly wound was healed. And all the earth
marvelled after the beast. 
Rev
13:4  And they worshipped the dragon who
gave authority to the beast. And they worshipped the beast, saying, “Who is
like the beast? Who is able to fight with him?” 
Rev
13:5  And he was given a mouth speaking
great matters and blasphemies, and he
was given authority to do so forty-two months. 
Rev
13:6  And he opened his mouth in
blasphemies against Elohim, to blaspheme His Name, and His Tent, and those
dwelling in the heaven. 
Rev
13:7  And it was given to him to fight
with the set-apart ones and to overcome them. And authority was given to him
over every tribe and tongue and nation. 
Rev
13:8  And all those dwelling on the
earth, whose names have not been written in the Book of Life of the slain Lamb,
from the foundation of the world shall worship him. 
Rev
13:9  If anyone has an ear, let him hear.

Rev
13:10  He who brings into captivity shall
go into captivity, he who kills with the sword has to be killed with the sword.
Here is the endurance and the belief of the set-apart ones. 
Rev
13:11  And I saw another beast coming up
out of the earth, and he had two horns like a lamb and spoke like a dragon. 
Rev
13:12  And he exercises all the authority
of the first beast in his presence, and causes the earth and those who dwell in
it to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed. 
Rev
13:13  And he does great signs, so that
he even makes fire come down from the heaven on the earth before men. 
Rev
13:14  And he leads astray those dwelling
on the earth because of those signs which he was given to do before the beast,
saying to those dwelling on the earth to make an image to the beast who was
wounded by the sword, yet lived. 
Rev
13:15  And there was given to him to give
spirit to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak
and cause to be killed as many as would not worship the image of the beast. 
Rev
13:16  And he causes all, both small and
great, and rich and poor, and free and slave, to be given a mark upon their
right hand or upon their foreheads, 
Rev
13:17  and that no one should be able to
buy or sell except he that has the mark or the name of the beast, or the number
of his name. 
Rev
13:18  Here is the wisdom! He who has
understanding, let him calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number
of a man, and his number is 666.
Rev
14:1  And I looked and saw a Lamb
standing on Mount Tsiyon, and with Him one hundred and forty-four thousand,
having His Father’s Name written upon their foreheads.
Rev
14:2  And I heard a voice out of the
heaven, like the voice of many waters, and like the voice of loud thunder, and
I heard the sound of harpists playing their harps. 
Rev
14:3  And they sang a renewed song before
the throne, and before the four living creatures, and the elders. And no one
was able to learn that song except the hundred and forty-four thousand who were
redeemed from the earth. 
Rev
14:4  They are those who were not defiled
with women, for they are maidens. They are those following the Lamb wherever He
leads them on. They were redeemed
from among men, being first-fruits to Elohim and to the Lamb. 
Rev
14:5  And in their mouth was found no
falsehood, for they are blameless before the throne of Elohim. 
Rev
14:6  And I saw another messenger flying
in mid-heaven, holding the everlasting Good News to announce to those dwelling
on the earth, even to every nation and tribe and tongue and people, 
Rev
14:7  saying with a loud voice, “Fear
Elohim and give esteem to Him, because the hour of His judgment has come. And
worship Him who made the heaven and the earth, and sea, and fountains of water.”

Rev
14:8  And another messenger followed,
saying, “Baḇel is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she has
made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her whoring.” 
Rev
14:9  And a third messenger followed
them, saying with a loud voice, “If anyone worships the beast and his image,
and receives his mark upon his forehead or upon his hand, 
Rev
14:10  he also shall drink of the wine of
the wrath of Elohim, which is poured out undiluted into the cup of His wrath.
And he shall be tortured with fire and sulphur before the set-apart messengers
and before the Lamb. 
Rev
14:11  “And the smoke of their torture
goes up forever and ever. And they have no rest day or night, those worshipping
the beast and his image, also if anyone receives the mark of his name.” 
Rev
14:12  Here is the endurance of the
set-apart ones, here are those guarding the commands of Elohim and the belief
of יהושע.
Rev
14:13  And I heard a voice out of the
heaven saying to me, “Write, ‘Blessed are the dead who die in the Master from
now on.’ ” “Yes,” says the Spirit, “in order that they rest from their labours,
and their works follow with them.” 
Rev
14:14  And I looked and saw a white
cloud, and sitting on the cloud was One like the Son of Aḏam, having on
His head a golden crown, and in His hand a sharp sickle. 
Rev
14:15  And another messenger came out of
the Dwelling Place, crying with a loud voice to the One sitting on the cloud, “Send
Your sickle and reap, because the hour has come for You to reap, because the
harvest of the earth is ripe.” 
Rev
14:16  And the One sitting on the cloud
thrust in His sickle on the earth, and the earth was reaped. 
Rev
14:17  And another messenger came out of
the Dwelling Place which is in the heaven, and he too held a sharp sickle. 
Rev
14:18  And another messenger came out
from the altar, having authority over the fire, and he cried with a loud cry to
him having the sharp sickle, saying, “Send your sharp sickle and gather the
clusters of the vine of the earth, because her grapes are ripe.” 
Rev
14:19  And the messenger thrust his
sickle into the earth and gathered the vine of the earth, and threw it into the
great winepress of the wrath of Elohim. 
Rev
14:20  And the winepress was trodden
outside the city, and blood came out of the winepress, up to the bridles of the
horses, for about three hundred kilometres. 
Rev
15:1  And I saw another sign in the
heaven, great and marvellous: seven messengers having the seven last plagues,
for the wrath of Elohim was ended in them.
Rev
15:2  And I saw like a sea of glass mixed
with fire, and those overcoming the beast and his image and his mark and the
number of his name, standing on the sea of glass, holding harps of Elohim. 
Rev
15:3  And they sing the song of Mosheh
the servant of Elohim, and the song of the Lamb, saying, “Great and marvellous
are Your works, יהוה Ĕl Shaddai! Righteous and
true are Your ways, O Sovereign of the set-apart ones! 
Rev
15:4  “Who shall not fear You, O יהוה,
and esteem Your Name? Because You alone are kind. Because all nations shall
come and worship before You, for Your righteousnesses have been made manifest.”
Rev
15:5  And after this I looked and saw the
Dwelling Place of the Tent of Witness in the heaven was opened. 
Rev
15:6  And out of the Dwelling Place came
the seven messengers having the seven plagues, dressed in clean bright linen,
and having their chests girded with golden bands. 
Rev
15:7  And one of the four living
creatures gave to the seven messengers seven golden bowls filled with the wrath
of Elohim who lives forever and ever. 
Rev
15:8  And the Dwelling Place was filled
with smoke from the esteem of Elohim and from His power, and no one was able to
enter the Dwelling Place until the seven plagues of the seven messengers were
ended. 
Rev
16:1  And I heard a loud voice from the Dwelling
Place saying to the seven messengers, “Go and pour out the bowls of the wrath
of Elohim on the earth.” 
Rev
16:2  And the first went and poured out
his bowl upon the earth, and an evil and wicked sore came upon the men, those
having the mark of the beast and those worshipping his image. 
Rev
16:3  And the second messenger poured out
his bowl on the sea, and it became blood, as of a dead one, and every living
creature in the sea died. 
Rev
16:4  And the third messenger poured out
his bowl on the rivers and fountains of water, and they became blood. 
Rev
16:5  And I heard the messenger of the
waters saying, “You are righteous, O יהוה, the One who
is and who was and who shall be, because You have judged these. 
Rev
16:6  “Because they have shed the blood
of set-apart ones and prophets, and You have given them blood to drink. For
they deserve it.” 
Rev
16:7  And I heard another out of the
altar saying, “Yes, יהוה Ĕl Shaddai, true and
righteous are Your judgments.” 
Rev
16:8  And the fourth messenger poured out
his bowl on the sun, and it was given to him to burn men with fire. 
Rev
16:9  And men were burned with great
heat, and they blasphemed the Name of Elohim who possesses authority over these
plagues. And they did not repent, to give Him esteem. 
Rev
16:10  And the fifth messenger poured out
his bowl on the throne of the beast, and his reign became darkened. And they
gnawed their tongues from pain. 
Rev
16:11  And they blasphemed the Elohim of
the heaven for their pains and their sores, and did not repent of their works. 
Rev
16:12  And the sixth messenger poured out
his bowl on the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up, in order to
prepare the way of the sovereigns from the east. 
Rev
16:13  And I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the
beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits, as
frogs, 
Rev
16:14  for they are spirits of demons,
doing signs, which go out to the sovereigns of the entire world, to gather them
to the battle of that great day of יהוה the Almighty. 
Rev
16:15  “See, I am coming as a thief.
Blessed is he who is staying awake and guarding his garments, lest he walk
naked and they see his shame.” 
Rev
16:16  And they gathered them together to
the place called in Heḇrew, Har Meḡiddo. 
Rev
16:17  And the seventh messenger poured
out his bowl into the air, and a loud voice came out of the Dwelling Place of
the heaven, from the throne, saying, “It is done!” 
Rev
16:18  And there came to be noises and
thunders and lightnings. And there came to be a great earthquake, such a mighty
and great earthquake as had not came to be since men were on the earth. 
Rev
16:19  And the great city became divided
into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. And great Baḇel was
remembered before Elohim, to give her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of
His wrath. 
Rev
16:20  And every island fled away, and
the mountains were not found. 
Rev
16:21  And great hail from the heaven
fell upon men, every hailstone about the weight of a talent. And men blasphemed
Elohim for the plague of the hail, because that plague was exceedingly great. 
Rev
17:1  And one of the seven messengers who
had the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying to me, “Come, I shall show
you the judgment of the great whore sitting on many waters,
Rev
17:2  with whom the sovereigns of the
earth committed whoring, and the inhabitants of the earth were made drunk with
the wine of her whoring.”
Rev
17:3  And he carried me away in the
Spirit into the wilderness. And I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast
covered with names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns. 
Rev
17:4  And the woman was dressed in purple
and scarlet, and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls, holding in
her hand a golden cup filled with abominations and the filthiness of her
whoring,
Rev
17:5  and upon her forehead a name
written, a secret: BAḆEL THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF THE WHORES AND OF THE
ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH. 
Rev
17:6  And I saw the woman, drunk with the
blood of the set-apart ones, and with the blood of the witnesses of יהושע.
And having seen her, I marvelled – greatly marvelled! 
Rev
17:7  And the messenger said to me, “Why
did you marvel? Let me explain to you the secret of the woman and of the beast
she rides, which has the seven heads and the ten horns. 
Rev
17:8  “The beast that you saw was, and is
not, and is about to come up out of the pit of the deep and goes to
destruction. And those dwelling on the earth, whose names are not written in
the Book of Life from the foundation of the world, shall marvel when they see
the beast that was, and is not, and yet is. 
Rev
17:9  “Here is the mind having wisdom:
The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sits. 
Rev
17:10  “And there are seven sovereigns:
five have fallen, and one is, and the other has not yet come. And when he
comes, he has to remain a little while. 
Rev
17:11  “And the beast that was, and is
not, is himself also the eighth, and is of the seven, and goes to destruction. 
Rev
17:12  “And the ten horns which you saw
are ten sovereigns who have not yet received a reign, but receive authority as
sovereigns with the beast for one hour. 
Rev
17:13  “They have one mind, and they
shall give their power and authority to the beast. 
Rev
17:14  “They shall fight with the Lamb,
and the Lamb shall overcome them, for He is Master of masters and Sovereign of
sovereigns. And those with Him are called, and chosen, and trustworthy.” 
Rev
17:15  And he said to me, “The waters
which you saw, where the whore sits, are peoples, and crowds, and nations, and
tongues. 
Rev
17:16  “And the ten horns which you saw
on the beast, these shall hate the whore, and lay her waste and naked, and eat
her flesh and burn her with fire. 
Rev
17:17  “For Elohim did give it into their
hearts to do His mind, to be of one mind, and to give their reign to the beast,
until the words of Elohim shall be accomplished. 
Rev
17:18  “And the woman whom you saw is
that great city having sovereignty over the sovereigns of the earth.” 
Rev
18:1  And after this I saw another
messenger coming down from the heaven, having great authority, and the earth
was lightened from his esteem. 
Rev
18:2  And he cried with a mighty voice,
saying, “Baḇel the great is fallen, is fallen, and has become a dwelling
place of demons, a haunt for every unclean spirit, and a haunt for every
unclean and hated bird, 
Rev
18:3  because all the nations have drunk
of the wine of the wrath of her whoring, and the sovereigns of the earth have
committed whoring with her, and the merchants of the earth have become rich
through the power of her riotous living.” 
Rev
18:4  And I heard another voice from the
heaven saying, “Come out of her, my people, lest you share in her sins, and
lest you receive of her plagues.
Rev
18:5  “Because her sins have piled up to
reach the heaven, and Elohim has remembered her unrighteousnesses. 
Rev
18:6  “Render to her as she indeed did
render, and repay her double according to her works. In the cup which she has
mixed, mix for her double. 
Rev
18:7  “As much as she esteemed herself
and lived riotously, so much torture and grief give to her, because in her
heart she says, ‘I sit as sovereigness, and I am not a widow, and I do not see
mourning at all.’ 
Rev
18:8  “Because of this her plagues shall
come in one day: death and mourning and scarcity of food. And she shall be
burned up with fire, because יהוה Elohim who judges her
is mighty. 
Rev
18:9  “And the sovereigns of the earth
who committed whoring and lived riotously with her shall weep and mourn over
her, when they see the smoke of her burning, 
Rev
18:10  standing at a distance for fear of
her torture, saying, ‘Woe! Woe, the great city Baḇel, the mighty city,
because your judgment has come in one hour!’ 
Rev
18:11  “And the merchants of the earth
weep and mourn over her, because no one buys their merchandise any more – 
Rev
18:12  merchandise of gold and silver,
and precious stone and pearls, and fine linen and purple, and silk and scarlet,
and all citron wood, and every object of ivory, and every object of most
precious wood and bronze and iron and marble, 
Rev
18:13  and cinnamon and incense, and
fragrant oil and frankincense, and wine and oil, and fine flour and wheat, and
cattle and sheep, and horses and carriages, and bodies and lives of men. 
Rev
18:14  “And the fruit that your being
longed for has gone from you. And all your riches and splendour are lost to
you, and you shall find them no more, not at all. 
Rev
18:15  “The merchants of these, those who
became rich by her, shall stand at a distance for fear of her torture, weeping
and mourning, 
Rev
18:16  and saying, ‘Woe! Woe, the great
city that was dressed in fine linen and purple and scarlet, and adorned with
gold and precious stones and pearls! 
Rev
18:17  ‘For in one hour such great riches
was laid waste.’ And every shipmaster, and every passenger, and sailors, and as
many as work the sea for their living,
stood at a distance, 
Rev
18:18  and cried out when they saw the
smoke of her burning, saying, ‘What is like this great city?’ 
Rev
18:19  “And they threw dust on their
heads and cried out, weeping and mourning, and saying, ‘Woe! Woe, the great
city, in which all who had ships on the sea became rich by her wealth! For in
one hour she was laid waste.’ 
Rev
18:20  “Rejoice over her, O heaven, and
you set-apart emissaries and prophets, for Elohim has completely avenged you on
her!” 
Rev
18:21  And one mighty messenger picked up
a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea, saying, “With such a
rush the great city Baḇel shall be thrown down, and shall not be found
any more at all. 
Rev
18:22  “And the sound of harpists, and
musicians, and flutists, and trumpeters shall not be heard in you any more at
all. And no craftsman of any trade shall be found in you any more at all. And
the sound of a millstone shall not be heard in you any more at all. 
Rev
18:23  “And the light of a lamp shall not
shine in you any more at all. And the voice of bridegroom and bride shall not
be heard in you any more at all. For your merchants were the great ones of the
earth, for by your drug sorcery all the nations were led astray. 
Rev
18:24  “And in her was found the blood of
prophets and set-apart ones, and of all who were slain on the earth.” 
Rev
19:1  And after this I heard a loud voice
of a great crowd in the heaven, saying, “Halleluyah! Deliverance and esteem and
respect and power to יהוה our Elohim! 
Rev
19:2  “Because true and righteous are His
judgments, because He has judged the great whore who corrupted the earth with
her whoring. And He has avenged on her the blood of His servants shed by her.”
Rev
19:3  And a second time they said, “Halleluyah!
And her smoke rises up forever and ever!” 
Rev
19:4  And the twenty-four elders and the
four living creatures fell down and worshipped Elohim who sat on the throne,
saying, “Amĕn! Halleluyah!” 
Rev
19:5  And a voice came from the throne,
saying, “Praise our Elohim, all you His servants and those who fear Him, both
small and great!”
Rev
19:6  And I heard as the voice of a great
crowd, as the sound of many waters and as the sound of mighty thunders, saying,
“Halleluyah, for יהוה Ĕl Shaddai reigns! 
Rev
19:7  “Let us be glad and rejoice and
give Him praise, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife prepared
herself.” 
Rev
19:8  And to her it was given to be
dressed in fine linen, clean and bright, for the fine linen is the
righteousnesses of the set-apart ones. 
Rev
19:9  And he said to me, “Write, ‘Blessed
are those who have been called to the marriage supper of the Lamb!’ ” And he
said to me, “These are the true words of Elohim.” 
Rev
19:10  And I fell at his feet to worship
him, but he said to me, “See, do not do
it! I am your fellow servant, and of your brothers who possess the witness of יהושע.
Worship Elohim! For the witness of יהושע is the
spirit of prophecy.” 
Rev
19:11  And I saw the heaven opened, and
there was a white horse. And He who sat on him was called Trustworthy and True,
and in righteousness He judges and fights.
Rev
19:12  And His eyes were as a flame of
fire, and on His head were many crowns, having a Name that had been written,
which no one had perceived except Himself –
Rev
19:13  and having been dressed in a robe
dipped in blood – and His Name is called: The Word of יהוה.
Rev
19:14  And the armies in the heaven,
dressed in fine linen, white and clean, followed Him on white horses. 
Rev
19:15  And out of His mouth goes a sharp
sword, that with it He should smite the nations. And He shall shepherd them
with a rod of iron. And He treads the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Ĕl
Shaddai. 
Rev
19:16  And on His robe and on His thigh
He has a name written: SOVEREIGN OF SOVEREIGNS AND MASTER OF MASTERS.
Rev
19:17  And I saw one messenger standing
in the sun, and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly in
mid-heaven, “Come and gather together for the supper of the great Elohim, 
Rev
19:18  to eat the flesh of sovereigns,
and the flesh of commanders, and the flesh of strong ones, and the flesh of
horses and of those who sit on them, and the flesh of all people, free and
slave, both small and great.” 
Rev
19:19  And I saw the beast, and the
sovereigns of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to fight Him who
sat on the horse and His army. 
Rev
19:20  And the beast was seized, and with
him the false prophet who worked signs in his presence, by which he led astray
those who received the mark of the beast and those who worshipped his image.
The two were thrown alive into the lake of fire burning with sulphur. 
Rev
19:21  And the rest were killed with the
sword which came from the mouth of Him who sat on the horse, and all the birds
were filled with their flesh. 
Rev
20:1  And I saw a messenger coming down
from the heaven, having the key to the pit of the deep and a great chain in his
hand. 
Rev
20:2  And he seized the dragon, the
serpent of old, who is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years,

Rev
20:3  and he threw him into the pit of
the deep, and shut him up, and set a seal on him, so that he should lead the
nations no more astray until the thousand years were ended. And after that he
has to be released for a little while. 
Rev
20:4  And I saw thrones – and they sat on
them, and judgment was given to them – and the lives of those who had been
beheaded because of the witness they bore to יהושע
and because of the Word of Elohim, and who did not worship the beast, nor his
image, and did not receive his mark upon their foreheads or upon their hands.
And they lived and reigned with Messiah for a thousand years 
Rev
20:5  (and the rest of the dead did not
come to life until the thousand years were ended) – this is the first
resurrection. 
Rev
20:6  Blessed and set-apart is the one
having part in the first resurrection. The second death possesses no authority
over these, but they shall be priests of Elohim and of Messiah, and shall reign
with Him a thousand years. 
Rev
20:7  And when the thousand years have
ended, Satan shall be released from his prison, 
Rev
20:8  and he shall go out to lead the
nations astray which are in the four corners of the earth, Goḡ and Maḡoḡ,
to gather them together for battle, whose number is as the sand of the sea. 
Rev
20:9  And they came up over the breadth
of the earth and surrounded the camp of the set-apart ones and the beloved
city. And fire came down from Elohim out of the heaven and consumed them. 
Rev
20:10  And the devil, who led them
astray, was thrown into the lake of fire and sulphur where the beast and the
false prophet are. And they shall be tortured day and night forever and ever. 
Rev
20:11  And I saw a great white throne and
Him who was sitting on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away,
and no place was found for them. 
Rev
20:12  And I saw the dead, small and
great, standing before the throne, and books were opened. And another book was
opened, which is the Book of Life.
And the dead were judged from what was written in the books, according to their
works. 
Rev
20:13  And the sea gave up the dead who
were in it, and death and the grave gave up the dead who were in them. And they
were judged, each one according to his works. 
Rev
20:14  And the death and the grave were
thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death.
Rev
20:15  And if anyone was not found
written in the Book of Life, he was thrown into the lake of fire. 
Rev
21:1  And I saw a renewed heaven and a
renewed earth, for the former heaven and the former earth had passed away, and
the sea is no more. 
Rev
21:2  And I, Yoḥanan, saw the
set-apart city, renewed Yerushalayim, coming down out of the heaven from
Elohim, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. 
Rev
21:3  And I heard a loud voice from the
heaven saying, “See, the Booth of Elohim is with men, and He shall dwell with
them, and they shall be His people, and Elohim Himself shall be with them and
be their Elohim.
Rev
21:4  “And Elohim shall wipe away every
tear from their eyes, and there shall be no more death, nor mourning, nor
crying. And there shall be no more pain, for the former matters have passed away.” 
Rev
21:5  And He who was sitting on the
throne said, “See, I make all matters
new.” And He said to me, “Write, for these words are true and trustworthy.” 
Rev
21:6  And He said to me, “It is done! I
am the ‘Aleph’ and the ‘Taw’, the Beginning and the End. To the one who thirsts
I shall give of the fountain of the water of life without payment. 
Rev
21:7  “The one who overcomes shall
inherit all this, and I shall be his Elohim and he shall be My son. 
Rev
21:8  “But as for the cowardly, and
untrustworthy, and abominable, and murderers, and those who whore, and drug
sorcerers, and idolaters, and all the false, their part is in the lake which
burns with fire and sulphur, which is the second death.” 
Rev
21:9  And one of the seven messengers who
held the seven bowls filled with the seven last plagues came to me and spoke
with me, saying, “Come, I shall show you the bride, the Lamb’s wife.” 
Rev
21:10  And he carried me away in the
Spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me the great city, the
set-apart Yerushalayim, descending out of the heaven from Elohim, 
Rev
21:11  having the esteem of Elohim, and
her light was like a most precious stone, like a jasper stone, clear as
crystal, 
Rev
21:12  and having a great and high wall,
having twelve gates, and at the gates twelve messengers, and names written on
them, which are those of the twelve
tribes of the children of Yisra’ĕl:
Rev
21:13  three gates on the east, three
gates on the north, three gates on the south, and three gates on the west. 
Rev
21:14  And the wall of the city had
twelve foundations, and on them were the names of the twelve emissaries of the
Lamb. 
Rev
21:15  And he who spoke with me had a
golden measuring rod, to measure the city, and its gates, and its wall. 
Rev
21:16  And the city lies four-cornered,
and its length is as great as its breadth. And he measured the city with the
rod: two thousand two hundred kilometres – the length, and the breadth, and
height of it are equal. 
Rev
21:17  And he measured its wall:
sixty-five metres, according to the measure of a man, that is, of a messenger. 
Rev
21:18  And the structure of its wall was
jasper. And the city was clean gold, like clear glass. 
Rev
21:19  And the foundations of the wall of
the city were adorned with all kinds of precious stones: the first foundation
jasper, the second sapphire, the third agate, the fourth emerald, 
Rev
21:20  the fifth sardonyx, the sixth
ruby, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth
chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, and the twelfth amethyst. 
Rev
21:21  And the twelve gates were twelve
pearls – each one of the gates was a single pearl. And the street of the city
was clean gold, like transparent glass. 
Rev
21:22  And I saw no Dwelling Place in it,
for יהוה Ĕl Shaddai is its Dwelling Place, and the
Lamb. 
Rev
21:23  And the city had no need of the
sun, nor of the moon, to shine in it, for the esteem of Elohim lightened it,
and the Lamb is its lamp. 
Rev
21:24  And the gentiles, of those who are
saved, shall walk in its light, and the sovereigns of the earth bring their
esteem into it.
Rev
21:25  And its gates shall not be shut at
all by day, for night shall not be there. 
Rev
21:26  And they shall bring the esteem
and the appreciation of the gentiles into it. 
Rev
21:27  And there shall by no means enter
into it whatever is unclean, neither anyone doing abomination and falsehood,
but only those who are written in the Lamb’s Book of Life.
Rev
22:1  And he showed me a river of water
of life, clear as crystal, coming from the throne of Elohim and of the Lamb. 
Rev
22:2  In the middle of its street, and on
either side of the river, was the tree of life, which bore twelve fruits, each
tree yielding its fruit every month. And the leaves of the tree were for the
healing of the nations. 
Rev
22:3  And no longer shall there be any
curse, and the throne of Elohim and of the Lamb shall be in it, and His
servants shall serve Him. 
Rev
22:4  And they shall see His face, and
His Name shall be upon their foreheads.

Rev
22:5  And night shall be no more, and
they shall have no need of a lamp or the light of the sun, because יהוה
Elohim shall give them light. And they shall reign forever and ever. 
Rev
22:6  And he said to me, “These words are
trustworthy and true. And יהוה Elohim of the set-apart
prophets has sent His messenger to show His servants what has to take place
with speed. 
Rev
22:7  “See, I am coming speedily! Blessed
is he who guards the words of the prophecy of this book.” 
Rev
22:8  And I, Yoḥanan, saw and heard
these matters. And when I heard and
saw, I fell down to worship before the feet of the messenger who showed me
these matters. 
Rev
22:9  And he said to me, “See, do not!
For I am your fellow servant, and of your brothers the prophets, and of those
who are guarding the words of this book. Worship Elohim.” 
Rev
22:10  And he said to me, “Do not seal
the words of the prophecy of this book, because the time is near. 
Rev
22:11  “He who does wrong, let him do
more wrong; he who is filthy, let him be more filthy; he who is righteous, let
him be more righteous; he who is set-apart, let him be more set-apart. 
Rev
22:12  “And see, I am coming speedily,
and My reward is with Me, to give to each according to his work.
Rev
22:13  “I am the ‘Aleph’ and the ‘Taw’,
the Beginning and the End, the First and the Last. 
Rev
22:14  “Blessed are those doing His
commands, so that the authority shall be theirs unto the tree of life, and to
enter through the gates into the city.
Rev
22:15  “But outside are the dogs and
those who enchant with drugs, and those who whore, and the murderers, and the
idolaters, and all who love and do falsehood.
Rev
22:16  “I, יהושע,
have sent My messenger to witness to you these matters in the assemblies. I am the Root and the Offspring of Dawiḏ,
the Bright and Morning Star.”
Rev
22:17  And the Spirit and the bride say, “Come!”
And he who hears, let him say, “Come!” And he who thirsts, come! And he who
desires it, take the water of life without paying! 
Rev
22:18  For I witness to everyone hearing
the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds to them, Elohim shall
add to him the plagues that are written in this book, 
Rev
22:19  and if anyone takes away from the
words of the book of this prophecy, Elohim shall take away his part from the
Book of Life, and out of the set-apart city, which are written in this Book. 
Rev
22:20  He that bears witness of these matters says, “Yes, I am coming
speedily.” Amĕn. Yes, come, Master יהושע ! 
Rev
22:21  The favour of our Master יהושע
Messiah be with the set-apart ones. Amĕn.
