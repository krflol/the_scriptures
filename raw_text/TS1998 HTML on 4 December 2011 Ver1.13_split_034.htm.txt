Ĕḵah/Lamentations
Lam
1:1  How alone she sits, The city once
great with people! Like a widow she has become, One great among the nations! A
princess among provinces has become a slave!
Lam
1:2  She weeps bitterly at night, And her
tears are upon her cheeks. Among all her lovers there is no comforter for her.
All her friends have betrayed her, They have become her enemies.
Lam
1:3  Yehuḏah has gone into exile,
Because of affliction and because of harsh labour. She has dwelt among
gentiles, She has found no rest. All her pursuers have overtaken her Between
narrow places.
Lam
1:4  The ways to Tsiyon mourn For no one
comes to the appointed times. All her gates are deserted, Her priests sigh, her
maidens are afflicted, And she has bitterness.
Lam
1:5  Her adversaries have become chief,
Her enemies have become at ease. For יהוה has afflicted
her Because of her many transgressions. Her children have gone into captivity
before the enemy.
Lam
1:6  And all the splendour has departed
From the daughter of Tsiyon. Her rulers have become like buck, They have found
no pasture, And they go powerless before the pursuer.
Lam
1:7  In the days of her affliction and
wandering, Yerushalayim remembered all her precious matters She had in the days of old. When her people fell into the
hand of the enemy, With no one to help her, The adversaries saw her, They
mocked at her Sabbaths.
Lam
1:8  Yerushalayim has sinned greatly,
Therefore she has become defiled. All who esteemed her despised her Because
they have seen her nakedness. She herself has sighed and turned away.
Lam
1:9  Her uncleanness is in her skirts.
She did not keep in mind her latter end, And has gone down appallingly, There
was no one to comfort her. “See, O יהוה, my affliction,
For the enemy has made himself great!”
Lam
1:10  The adversary has spread his hand
Over all her precious matters;
Indeed, she has seen: The gentiles have entered her set-apart place, Those whom
You commanded not to enter Your assembly.
Lam
1:11  All her people are sighing, seeking
bread. They have given their precious matters
For food, to bring back life. “See, O יהוה, and look,
For I have become despised.”
Lam
1:12  “Is it naught to you, All you who
pass by? Look and see if there is any pain like my pain, Which has been brought
on me, Which יהוה has inflicted on me In the day of His
burning displeasure.
Lam
1:13  “From above He has sent fire into
my bones, And it overpowered them; He has spread a net for my feet and turned
me back; He has laid me waste and faint all the day.
Lam
1:14  “The yoke of my transgressions Has
been bound by His hand, Woven together and thrust upon my neck. He has made my
strength stumble, יהוה has given me into hands Which I
am unable to withstand.
Lam
1:15  “ יהוה has
trodden down all my strong men in my midst, He has called an appointed time
Against me to crush my young men. יהוה has trodden down
as in a winepress The maiden daughter of Yehuḏah.
Lam
1:16  “This is why I weep. My eye, my eye
is running down with water, Because the comforter, Who could bring back my
life, Has been far from me. My children are stunned, For the enemy has
prevailed.”
Lam
1:17  Tsiyon spreads out her hands, There
is no comforter for her. יהוה has commanded concerning
Ya‛aqoḇ, His neighbours are his adversaries. Yerushalayim has
become an uncleanness among them.
Lam
1:18  יהוה is
righteous, for I rebelled against His mouth. Hear now, all peoples, and see my
pain. My maidens and my young men have gone into captivity.
Lam
1:19  I called for my lovers, but they
deceived me. My priests and my elders breathed their last in the city, While
they sought food to bring back their life.
Lam
1:20  “See, O יהוה,
that I am in distress. My inward parts are boiling up, My heart is overturned
within me, For I have been very rebellious. From without the sword has
bereaved, At home it is like death.
Lam
1:21  “They have heard that I sighed,
With no one to comfort me. All my enemies have heard of my calamity, They have
rejoiced that You have done it. You shall bring on the day that You have
announced, So let them become like me.
Lam
1:22  “Let all their evil come before
You, And do to them as You have done to me For all my transgressions. For my
sighs are many, and my heart is faint.”
Lam
2:1  How יהוה in
His displeasure Has covered the daughter of Tsiyon with a cloud! He has cast
down from the heavens to the earth The comeliness of Yisra’ĕl, And has not
remembered His footstool in the day of His displeasure.
Lam
2:2  יהוה has
swallowed up, without compassion, All the pastures of Ya‛aqoḇ. In
His wrath He has thrown down The strongholds of the daughter of Yehuḏah.
He has brought them down to the ground. He has profaned the reign and its
rulers.
Lam
2:3  In the heat of displeasure He has
cut off every horn of Yisra’ĕl. He has withdrawn His right hand from
before the enemy. And He burns against Ya‛aqoḇ Like a flaming fire,
consuming all around.
Lam
2:4  He has bent His bow like an enemy.
He has set His right hand like an adversary. And He slays all who delighted the
eye. In the tent of the daughter of Tsiyon, He has poured out His wrath like
fire.
Lam
2:5  יהוה has
been like an enemy. He has swallowed up Yisra’ĕl, He has swallowed up all
her palaces, He has destroyed her strongholds. And He increases mourning and
lamentation In the daughter of Yehuḏah.
Lam
2:6  He has demolished His booth like a
garden, He has destroyed His place of meeting. יהוה has
made the appointed times and Sabbaths To be forgotten in Tsiyon, And despises
sovereign and priest In His raging displeasure.
Lam
2:7  יהוה has
cast off His altar, He has rejected His set-apart place, He has delivered the
walls of her palaces Into the hand of the enemy. They have made a noise in the
House of יהוה As on the day of an appointed time.
Lam
2:8  יהוה has
planned to destroy The wall of the daughter of Tsiyon. He has stretched out a
line. He has not turned back His hand from destroying. And He has made the rampart
and wall to lament; Together they have languished.
Lam
2:9  Her gates have sunk into the ground.
He has destroyed and broken her bars. Her sovereign and her rulers are among
the gentiles. The Torah is no more, And her prophets have found no vision from יהוה.
Lam
2:10  The elders of the daughter of
Tsiyon Sit on the ground, are silent. They have thrown dust on their heads,
They have girded themselves with sackcloth. The maidens of Yerushalayim Have
let their heads hang to the ground.
Lam
2:11  My eyes are spent with tears, My
inward parts ferment, My bile has been poured on the ground Because of the
destruction of the daughter of my people, As children and the infants languish
In the streets of the city.
Lam
2:12  They say to their mothers, “Where
is grain and wine?” As they languish like the wounded In the streets of the
city, As their life is poured out in their mothers’ bosom.
Lam
2:13  How shall I admonish you, To what
shall I compare you, O daughter of Yerushalayim? To what shall I liken you to
comfort you, O maiden daughter of Tsiyon? For your breach is as great as the
sea. Who shall heal you?
Lam
2:14  Your prophets have seen Falsehood
and folly for you, And have not shown you your crookedness, To turn back your
captivity. But their visions for you Are false and misleading messages.
Lam
2:15  All who pass by have clapped their
hands at you. They have whistled, And they shake their heads At the daughter of
Yerushalayim, “Is this the city that is called ‘The perfection of loveliness,
The joy of all the earth’?”
Lam
2:16  All your enemies have opened Their
mouth against you; They have whistled and they gnash their teeth. They say, “We
have swallowed her up! This is certainly the day we waited for; We have found
it, we have seen it.”
Lam
2:17  יהוה has done
what He planned, He has filled His word Which He commanded in days of old. He
has torn down, without compassion, And He has let your enemy rejoice over you.
He has exalted the horn of your adversaries.
Lam
2:18  Their heart cried out to יהוה,
“O wall of the daughter of Tsiyon, Let tears run down like a river day and
night. Give yourself no numbness, Let your eyes have no rest.
Lam
2:19  “Arise, cry out in the night, At
the beginning of the watches, Pour out your heart like water Before the face of
יהוה. Lift your hands toward Him For the life of your
young children, Who languish from hunger At the head of every street.
Lam
2:20  “See, O יהוה,
and look attentively To whom have You done thus. Should the women eat their
offspring, Infants of a hand breadth? Should the priest and prophet be slain In
the set-apart place of יהוה ?
Lam
2:21  “Young and old lie on the ground in
the streets. My maidens and my young men have fallen by the sword. You have
slain them in the day of Your displeasure, You have slaughtered without
compassion.
Lam
2:22  “Would You proclaim, as in a day of
appointed time, The fears that surround me? And no one escaped or survived In
the day of the displeasure of יהוה. Those whom I have
nursed and brought up My enemy has destroyed.”
Lam
3:1  I am the man who has seen affliction
By the rod of His wrath.
Lam
3:2  He has led me and made me walk In
darkness and not light.
Lam
3:3  Indeed, He has turned back, He has
turned His hand against me all the day.
Lam
3:4  He has worn out my flesh and my skin,
He has broken my bones.
Lam
3:5  He has piled up against me, And
surrounded me with bitterness and hardship.
Lam
3:6  He has made me dwell in dark places
Like the dead of old.
Lam
3:7  He has hedged me in and I do not go
out, He has made my chain heavy.
Lam
3:8  Also, when I cry and shout, He shuts
out my prayer.
Lam
3:9  He has blocked my ways with hewn
stone, He has made my paths crooked.
Lam
3:10  He is to me like a bear lying in
wait, A lion in hiding.
Lam
3:11  He has turned aside my ways And
torn me in pieces, He has laid me waste.
Lam
3:12  He has bent His bow And set me up
as a target for the arrow.
Lam
3:13  He made the arrows of His quiver
pierce my kidneys. 
Lam
3:14  I have been a mockery to all my
people, Their mocking song all the
day.
Lam
3:15  He has filled me with bitterness,
He drenched me with wormwood.
Lam
3:16  And He has broken my teeth with
gravel, He has covered me with ashes.
Lam
3:17  And You have removed my being far
from peace, I have forgotten goodness.
Lam
3:18  And I said, “My strength and my
expectancy Have perished from יהוה.”
Lam
3:19  Remember my affliction and my
anguish, The wormwood and the gall.
Lam
3:20  Your being indeed remembers And
bows down upon me.
Lam
3:21  This I recall to my mind, therefore
I wait:
Lam
3:22  The kindnesses of יהוה
! For we have not been consumed, For His compassions have not ended.
Lam
3:23  They are new every morning, Great
is Your trustworthiness.
Lam
3:24  “ יהוה is
my Portion,” says my being, “Therefore I wait for Him!”
Lam
3:25  יהוה is
good to those waiting for Him, To the being who seeks Him.
Lam
3:26  It is good – both to wait and to be
silent, For the deliverance of יהוה.
Lam
3:27  It is good for a man to bear a yoke
in his youth. 
Lam
3:28  Let him sit alone and be silent,
Because He has laid it on him.
Lam
3:29  Let him put his mouth in the dust,
There might yet be expectancy.
Lam
3:30  Let him give his cheek To the one
who smites him – He is filled with reproach.
Lam
3:31  For יהוה
does not cast off forever. 
Lam
3:32  For though He afflicted, Yet He
shall show compassion According to the greatness of His kindnesses.
Lam
3:33  For He has not afflicted from His
heart, Nor does He grieve the children of men.
Lam
3:34  To crush under His feet All the
prisoners of the earth,
Lam
3:35  To turn aside the right-ruling of
man Before the face of the Most High,
Lam
3:36  Or wrong a man in his cause – This יהוה
does not approve.
Lam
3:37  Who was it that spoke, And it came
to be! Has יהוה not commanded it?
Lam
3:38  Do not the evils and the good Come
out of the mouth of the Most High?
Lam
3:39  What? Should mankind complain, A
living man, because of his sins?
Lam
3:40  Let us search and examine our ways,
And turn back to יהוה.
Lam
3:41  Let us lift our hearts and hands To
Ĕl in the heavens and say:
Lam
3:42  We, we have transgressed and
rebelled. You, You have not forgiven.
Lam
3:43  You have wrapped Yourself With
displeasure and pursued us. You have slain, You have not shown compassion.
Lam
3:44  You have wrapped Yourself With a
cloud, so that prayer does not pass through.
Lam
3:45  You make us as scum and refuse In
the midst of the peoples.
Lam
3:46  All our enemies have opened their
mouth against us. 
Lam
3:47  Fear and a snare have come upon us,
Shame and ruin.
Lam
3:48  Streams of water run down my eye
For the ruin of the daughter of my people.
Lam
3:49  My eye flows out and does not
cease, Without stopping,
Lam
3:50  Until יהוה
looks down and sees from the heavens. 
Lam
3:51  My eye pains my being Because of
all the daughters of my city.
Lam
3:52  My enemies hunted me down Like a
bird, without cause.
Lam
3:53  They have cut off my life in the
pit, And they threw stones at me.
Lam
3:54  Waters flowed over my head; I said,
“I am cut off!”
Lam
3:55  I called on Your Name, O יהוה,
from the lowest pit.
Lam
3:56  You have heard my voice, Do not
hide Your ear from my groaning, From my outcry!
Lam
3:57  You drew near on the day I called
on You; You said, “Do not fear!”
Lam
3:58  O יהוה, You
did plead the case for my being; You have redeemed my life.
Lam
3:59  O יהוה, You
have seen my oppression; Judge my case.
Lam
3:60  You have seen all their vengeance,
All their plans against me.
Lam
3:61  You have heard their reproach, O יהוה,
all their plans against me,
Lam
3:62  The lips of those rising against
me, And their scheming against me all the day.
Lam
3:63  Look at their sitting down and
their rising up; I am their song.
Lam
3:64  Repay them, O יהוה,
According to the work of their hands.
Lam
3:65  Give them a veiled heart, Your
curse upon them!
Lam
3:66  Pursue and destroy them in
displeasure, From under the heavens of יהוה.
Lam
4:1  How dim the gold has become, The
fine gold changed! The stones of the set-apart place Are scattered at the head
of every street.
Lam
4:2  The precious sons of Tsiyon Who were
weighed against fine gold, How they have been reckoned as clay pots, The work
of the hands of the potter!
Lam
4:3  Even jackals have presented their
breasts, They have nursed their young. The daughter of my people has become as
cruel, As ostriches in the wilderness.
Lam
4:4  The tongue of the infant has clung
To the roof of its mouth for thirst; Children asked for bread, No one breaks it
for them.
Lam
4:5  Those who ate delicacies Have been
laid waste in the streets; Those who were brought up in scarlet Have embraced
dunghills.
Lam
4:6  And the crookedness of the daughter
of my people Is greater than the punishment of the sin of Seḏom, Which
was overthrown in a moment, And no hands were wrung over her!
Lam
4:7  Her Nazirites were brighter than snow
And whiter than milk; More ruddy in body than rubies, Their cut like sapphire.
Lam
4:8  Their appearance has become blacker
than soot; They have become unrecognised in the streets; Their skin has
shrivelled on their bones, It has become dry, it has become as wood.
Lam
4:9  Better off were those pierced by the
sword Than those pierced by hunger; For these pine away, Pierced through for
lack of the fruits of the field.
Lam
4:10  The hands of the compassionate
women Have boiled their own children; They became food for them In the
destruction of the daughter of my people.
Lam
4:11  יהוה has
completed His wrath, He has poured out His burning displeasure. And He kindled
a fire in Tsiyon, And it consumed her foundations.
Lam
4:12  The sovereigns of the earth did not
believe, Nor any of the inhabitants of the world, That an adversary and enemy
Would enter the gates of Yerushalayim.
Lam
4:13  It was because of the sins of her
prophets, The crookednesses of her priests, Who shed in her midst the blood of
the righteous.
Lam
4:14  They staggered, blind, in the
streets; They have defiled themselves with blood, So that no one was able to
touch their garments.
Lam
4:15  They shouted at them, “Away! Unclean!
Away! Away! Touch not!” When they fled and staggered, They said, among the
gentiles, “They shall stay no longer.”
Lam
4:16  The face of יהוה
scattered them. He no longer regards them. They showed no respect for the
priests Nor favour to the elders.
Lam
4:17  While we exist, our eyes are
consumed, Watching vainly for our help. In our watch-tower we watched for a
nation That could not save.
Lam
4:18  They have hunted our steps From
going in our streets. Our end was near, Our days were completed, For our end
had come.
Lam
4:19  Our pursuers were swifter Than the
eagles of the heavens. They came hotly after us on the mountains And lay in
wait for us in the wilderness.
Lam
4:20  The breath of our nostrils, the
anointed of יהוה, Was caught in their pits, In whose
shadow we had thought To live among the gentiles.
Lam
4:21  Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of
Eḏom, You who dwell in the land of Uz! The cup is to pass over to you
too, So that you become drunk and make yourself naked.
Lam
4:22  Your crookedness has been
completed, O daughter of Tsiyon. He no longer prolongs your exile. He shall
punish your crookedness, O daughter of Eḏom, He shall uncover your sins!
Lam
5:1  Remember, O יהוה,
what has come upon us. Look, and see our reproach!
Lam
5:2  Our inheritance has been turned over
to strangers, And our houses to foreigners.
Lam
5:3  We have become orphans, fatherless,
Our mothers are like widows.
Lam
5:4  We had to pay for our drinking
water, And our wood comes at a price.
Lam
5:5  We have been pursued close onto our
neck, We have laboured and had no rest.
Lam
5:6  To Mitsrayim we have given a hand;
To Ashshur, to be satisfied with bread.
Lam
5:7  Our fathers sinned, they are no
more. We have borne their crookednesses.
Lam
5:8  Servants have ruled over us; There is
no one to deliver from their hand.
Lam
5:9  With our lives we bring in our
bread, Because of the sword of the wilderness.
Lam
5:10  Our skin has become as hot as an
oven, Because of the burning heat of scarcity of food.
Lam
5:11  They have humbled the women in
Tsiyon, The maidens in the cities of Yehuḏah.
Lam
5:12  Rulers were hung up by their hands,
And elders were not respected.
Lam
5:13  They have taken young men to grind,
And youths stumbled under loads of
wood.
Lam
5:14  Elders have ceased from the gate,
Young men from their song.
Lam
5:15  The joy of our heart has ceased,
Our dancing has turned into mourning.
Lam
5:16  The crown has fallen from our head.
Woe to us, for we have sinned!
Lam
5:17  Because of this our heart has been
sick, Because of these our eyes have become dim,
Lam
5:18  Because of Mount Tsiyon which is
laid waste; Foxes have gone roaming in it.
Lam
5:19  You, O יהוה,
remain forever, Your throne from generation to generation.
Lam
5:20  Why do You forget us forever,
Forsake us for length of days?
Lam
5:21  Turn us back to You, O יהוה,
And let us turn back, Renew our days as of old.
Lam
5:22  You have been wroth with us,
exceedingly!
