Luqas/Luke
Luk
1:1  Since many have indeed taken in hand
to set in order an account of the matters completely confirmed among us, 
Luk
1:2  as those who from the beginning were
eyewitnesses and servants of the word delivered them to us, 
Luk
1:3  it seemed good to me as well, having
followed up all these matters exactly from the beginning, to write to you an
orderly account, most excellent Theophilos, 
Luk
1:4  that you might know the certainty of
the words which you were taught. 
Luk
1:5  There was in the days of Herodes,
the sovereign of Yehuḏah, a certain priest named Zeḵaryah, of the
division of Aḇiyah. And his wife was of the daughters of Aharon, and her
name was Elisheḇa. 
Luk
1:6  And they were both righteous before
Elohim, blamelessly walking in all the commands and righteousnesses of יהוה.

Luk
1:7  And they had no child, because
Elisheḇa was barren, and both were advanced in years. 
Luk
1:8  And it came to be, that while he was
serving as priest before Elohim in the order of his division, 
Luk
1:9  according to the institute of the
priesthood, he was chosen by lot to burn incense when he went into the Dwelling
Place of יהוה. 
Luk
1:10  And the entire crowd of people was
praying outside at the hour of incense. 
Luk
1:11  And a messenger of יהוה
appeared to him, standing on the right side of the altar of incense. 
Luk
1:12  And when Zeḵaryah saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon
him. 
Luk
1:13  But the messenger said to him, “Do
not be afraid, Zeḵaryah, for your prayer is heard. And your wife Elisheḇa
shall bear you a son, and you shall call his name Yoḥanan. 
Luk
1:14  “And you shall have joy and
gladness, and many shall rejoice at his birth. 
Luk
1:15  “For he shall be great before יהוה,
and shall drink no wine and strong drink at all. And he shall be filled with
the Set-apart Spirit, even from his mother’s womb. 
Luk
1:16  “And he shall turn many of the
children of Yisra’ĕl to יהוה their Elohim. 
Luk
1:17  “And he shall go before Him in the
spirit and power of Ĕliyahu, ‘to turn the hearts of the fathers to the
children,’ and the disobedient to the insight of the righteous, to make ready a
people prepared for יהוה.” 
Luk
1:18  And Zeḵaryah said to the
messenger, “By what shall I know this? For I am old, and my wife advanced in
years.” 
Luk
1:19  And the messenger answering, said
to him, “I am Gaḇri’ĕl, who stands in the presence of Elohim, and
was sent to speak to you and announce to you this good news. 
Luk
1:20  “But see, you shall be silent and
unable to speak until the day this takes place, because you did not believe my
words which shall be filled in their appointed time.” 
Luk
1:21  And the people waited for Zeḵaryah,
and marvelled at his delay in the Dwelling Place. 
Luk
1:22  And when he came out, he was unable
to speak to them. And they recognised that he had seen a vision in the Dwelling
Place, for he was beckoning to them and remained dumb. 
Luk
1:23  And it came to be, as soon as the
days of his service were completed, he went away to his house. 
Luk
1:24  And after those days his wife
Elisheḇa conceived. And she hid herself five months, saying, 
Luk
1:25  “ יהוה has
done this for me, in the days when He looked upon me, to take away my reproach
among men.” 
Luk
1:26  And in the sixth month the
messenger Gaḇri’ĕl was sent by Elohim to a city of Galil named
Natsareth, 
Luk
1:27  to a maiden engaged to a man whose
name was Yosĕph, of the house of Dawiḏ. And the maiden’s name was
Miryam. 
Luk
1:28  And the messenger, coming to her,
said, “Greetings, favoured one, the Master is with you. Blessed are you among
women!” 
Luk
1:29  But she was greatly disturbed at
his word, and wondered what kind of greeting this was. 
Luk
1:30  And the messenger said to her, “Do
not be afraid, Miryam, for you have found favour with Elohim. 
Luk
1:31  “And see, you shall conceive in
your womb, and shall give birth to a Son, and call His Name יהושע.
Luk
1:32  “He shall be great, and shall be
called the Son of the Most High. And יהוה Elohim shall
give Him the throne of His father Dawiḏ. 
Luk
1:33  “And He shall reign over the house
of Ya‛aqoḇ forever, and there shall be no end to His reign.”
Luk
1:34  And Miryam said to the messenger, “How
shall this be, since I do not know a man?” 
Luk
1:35  And the messenger answering, said
to her, “The Set-apart Spirit shall come upon you, and the power of the Most
High shall overshadow you. And for that reason the Set-apart One born of you
shall be called: Son of Elohim. 
Luk
1:36  “And see, Elisheḇa your
relative, she has also conceived a son in her old age. And this is now the
sixth month to her who was called barren, 
Luk
1:37  because with Elohim no matter shall
be impossible.” 
Luk
1:38  And Miryam said, “See the female
servant of יהוה ! Let it be to me according to your
word.” And the messenger went away from her. 
Luk
1:39  And Miryam arose in those days and
went into the hill country with haste, to a city of Yehuḏah, 
Luk
1:40  and entered into the house of Zeḵaryah
and greeted Elisheḇa. 
Luk
1:41  And it came to be, when Elisheḇa
heard the greeting of Miryam, that the baby leaped in her womb. And Elisheḇa
was filled with the Set-apart Spirit, 
Luk
1:42  and called out with a loud voice
and said, “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb! 
Luk
1:43  “And who am I, that the mother of
my Master should come to me? 
Luk
1:44  “For look, when the sound of your
greeting came to my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy. 
Luk
1:45  “Blessed is she who believed, for
that which יהוה has said to her shall be accomplished!”

Luk
1:46  And Miryam said, “My being makes יהוה
great, 
Luk
1:47  and my spirit has rejoiced in
Elohim my Saviour. 
Luk
1:48  “Because He looked on the
humiliation of His female servant. For look, from now on all generations shall
call me blessed. 
Luk
1:49  “For He who is mighty has done
wonders for me, and set-apart is His Name. 
Luk
1:50  “And His compassion is from
generation to generation, to those who fear Him. 
Luk
1:51  “He did mightily with His arm, He
scattered the proud in the thought of their hearts. 
Luk
1:52  “He brought down rulers from their
thrones, and exalted the lowly. 
Luk
1:53  “He has filled the hungry with good
items, and the rich He has sent away
empty. 
Luk
1:54  “He sustained Yisra’ĕl, His servant,
in remembrance of His compassion, 
Luk
1:55  as He spoke to our fathers, to Aḇraham
and to his seed, forever.” 
Luk
1:56  And Miryam stayed with her about
three months, and returned to her home. 
Luk
1:57  And the time was filled for Elisheḇa
to give birth, and she bore a son. 
Luk
1:58  And her neighbours and relatives
heard how יהוה had shown great compassion to her, and
they rejoiced with her. 
Luk
1:59  And it came to be, on the eighth
day, that they came to circumcise the child. And they were calling him by the
name of his father, Zeḵaryah. 
Luk
1:60  And his mother answering, said, “Not
so, but he shall be called Yoḥanan.” 
Luk
1:61  And they said to her, “There is no
one among your relatives who is called by this name.” 
Luk
1:62  Then they motioned to his father,
what he would like him to be called. 
Luk
1:63  And having asked for a writing
tablet, he wrote, saying, “Yoḥanan is his name.” And they all marvelled. 
Luk
1:64  And at once his mouth was opened
and his tongue loosed, and he was speaking, praising Elohim. 
Luk
1:65  And fear came on all those dwelling
around them, and all these matters were spoken of in all the hill country of
Yehuḏah. 
Luk
1:66  And all who heard them kept them in
their hearts, saying, “What then shall this child be?” And the hand of יהוה
was with him. 
Luk
1:67  And Zeḵaryah, his father, was
filled with the Set-apart Spirit, and prophesied, saying, 
Luk
1:68  “Blessed be יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, for He did look upon and worked redemption for His
people, 
Luk
1:69  and has raised up a horn of
deliverance for us in the house of His servant Dawiḏ, 
Luk
1:70  as He spoke by the mouth of His
set-apart prophets, from of old – 
Luk
1:71  deliverance from our enemies and
from the hand of all those hating us, 
Luk
1:72  to show compassion toward our
fathers and to remember His set-apart covenant, 
Luk
1:73  an oath which He swore to our
father Aḇraham: 
Luk
1:74  to give to us, being delivered from
the hand of our enemies, to serve Him without fear, 
Luk
1:75  in set-apartness and righteousness
before Him all the days of our life. 
Luk
1:76  “And you, child, shall be called
prophet of the Most High, for you shall go before the face of יהוה
to prepare His ways, 
Luk
1:77  to give knowledge of deliverance to
His people, by the forgiveness of their sins, 
Luk
1:78  through the tender compassion of
our Elohim, with which the daybreak from on high has looked upon us, 
Luk
1:79  to give light to those who sit in
darkness and the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.” 
Luk
1:80  And the child grew and became
strong in spirit, and was in the deserts until the day of showing Himself
openly to Yisra’ĕl. 
Luk
2:1  And it came to be in those days that
a decree went out from Caesar Augustus for all the world to be registered. 
Luk
2:2  This took place as a first
registration while Quirinius was governing Syria. 
Luk
2:3  And all were going to be registered,
each one to his own city. 
Luk
2:4  And Yosĕph also went up from
Galil, out of the city of Natsareth to Yehuḏah, to the city of Dawiḏ,
which is called Bĕyth Leḥem, because he was of the house and lineage
of Dawiḏ, 
Luk
2:5  to be registered with Miryam, who
was engaged to him – being pregnant. 
Luk
2:6  And it came to be, that while they
were there, the days were filled for her to give birth. 
Luk
2:7  And she gave birth to her first-born
Son, and wrapped Him up, and laid Him down in a feeding trough, because there
was no room for them in a lodging place. 
Luk
2:8  And in the same country there were
shepherds living out in the fields, keeping watch over their flock by night. 
Luk
2:9  And look, a messenger of יהוה
stood before them, and the esteem of יהוה shone around
them, and they were greatly afraid. 
Luk
2:10  And the messenger said to them, “Do
not be afraid, for look, I bring you good news of great joy which shall be to
all people. 
Luk
2:11  “Because there was born to you
today in the city of Dawiḏ a Saviour, who is Messiah, the Master. 
Luk
2:12  “And this is the sign to you: You
shall find a baby wrapped up, lying in a feeding trough.” 
Luk
2:13  And suddenly there was with the
messenger a crowd of the heavenly host praising Elohim and saying, 
Luk
2:14  “Esteem to Elohim in the highest,
and on earth peace among men with whom He is pleased!” 
Luk
2:15  And it came to be, when the
messengers had gone away from them into the heaven, that the shepherds said to
each other, “Indeed, let us go to Bĕyth Leḥem and see this matter
that has taken place, which the Master has made known to us.” 
Luk
2:16  And they came in haste and found
Miryam and Yosĕph, and the baby lying in a feeding trough. 
Luk
2:17  And having seen, they made known
the matter which was spoken to them concerning the child. 
Luk
2:18  And all those who heard marvelled
at what the shepherds said to them. 
Luk
2:19  But Miryam kept all these matters,
considering them in her heart. 
Luk
2:20  And the shepherds returned,
boasting and praising Elohim for all they had heard and seen, as it was spoken
to them. 
Luk
2:21  And when eight days were completed
for Him to be circumcised, His Name was called יהושע,
the Name given by the messenger before He was conceived in the womb. 
Luk
2:22  And when the days of her cleansing
according to the Torah of Mosheh were completed, they brought Him to
Yerushalayim to present Him to יהוה – 
Luk
2:23  as it has been written in the Torah
of יהוה, “Every male who opens the womb shall be called
set-apart to יהוה ” – 
Luk
2:24  and to give an offering according
to what is said in the Torah of יהוה, “A pair of
turtledoves or two young pigeons.” 
Luk
2:25  And see, there was a man in
Yerushalayim whose name was Shim‛on, and this man was righteous and
dedicated, looking for the comforting of Yisra’ĕl. And the Set-apart
Spirit was upon him. 
Luk
2:26  And it had been revealed to him by
the Set-apart Spirit that he would not see death before he sees the Messiah of יהוה.

Luk
2:27  And he came in the Spirit into the
Set-apart Place. And as the parents brought in the Child יהושע,
to do for Him according to the usual practice of the Torah, 
Luk
2:28  then he took Him up in his arms and
blessed Elohim and said, 
Luk
2:29  “Now let Your servant go in peace,
O Master, according to Your word, 
Luk
2:30  for my eyes have seen Your
deliverance, 
Luk
2:31  which You have prepared before the
face of all the peoples, 
Luk
2:32  a light for the unveiling of the
gentiles, and the esteem of Your people Yisra’ĕl.” 
Luk
2:33  And Yosĕph and His mother were
marvelling at what was said about Him. 
Luk
2:34  And Shim‛on blessed them, and
said to Miryam His mother, “See, this One is set for a fall and rising of many
in Yisra’ĕl, and for a sign spoken against – 
Luk
2:35  and a sword shall pierce through
your own being also – so as to reveal the thoughts of many hearts.” 
Luk
2:36  And there was Ḥannah, a
prophetess, a daughter of Penu’ĕl, of the tribe of Ashĕr. She was
advanced in years, and had lived with a husband seven years from her
maidenhood, 
Luk
2:37  and she was a widow of about
eighty-four years, who did not leave the Set-apart Place, but served Elohim
with fastings and prayers night and day. 
Luk
2:38  And she, coming in at that moment,
gave thanks to יהוה, and spoke of Him to all who were
waiting for redemption in Yerushalayim. 
Luk
2:39  And when they had accomplished all matters according to the Torah of יהוה,
they returned to Galil, to their city Natsareth. 
Luk
2:40  And the Child grew and became
strong in spirit, being filled with wisdom. And the favour of Elohim was upon
Him. 
Luk
2:41  And His parents went to
Yerushalayim every year at the Festival of the Passover. 
Luk
2:42  And when He was twelve years old,
they went up to Yerushalayim according to the practice of the festival. 
Luk
2:43  When they had accomplished the
days, as they returned, the Child יהושע stayed
behind in Yerushalayim. And His parents did not know it, 
Luk
2:44  but thinking He was in the company,
they went a day’s journey, and were seeking Him among the relatives and
friends. 
Luk
2:45  And not having found Him, they
returned to Yerushalayim, seeking Him. 
Luk
2:46  And it came to be, after three
days, that they found Him in the Set-apart Place, sitting in the midst of the
teachers, both listening to them and asking them questions. 
Luk
2:47  And all who heard Him were
astonished at His understanding and answers. 
Luk
2:48  And having seen Him, they were
amazed. And His mother said to Him, “Son, why have You done this to us? See,
Your father and I have been anxiously seeking You.” 
Luk
2:49  And He said to them, “Why were you
seeking Me? Did you not know that I had to be in the matters of My Father?” 
Luk
2:50  But they did not understand the
word which He spoke to them. 
Luk
2:51  And He went down with them and came
to Natsareth, and was subject to them, but His mother kept all these matters in
her heart. 
Luk
2:52  And יהושע
increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with Elohim and men. 
Luk
3:1  And in the fifteenth year of the
reign of Tiberius Caesar, when Pontius Pilate was governor of Yehuḏah,
and Herodes district ruler of Galil, and his brother Philip district ruler of
Yetur and the country of Trachonitis, and Lusanias district ruler of Aḇilene,

Luk
3:2  Ḥanan and Qayapha being high
priests, the word of Elohim came to Yoḥanan the son of Zeḵaryah in
the wilderness. 
Luk
3:3  And he went into all the
neighbourhood of the Yardĕn, proclaiming an immersion of repentance for
the forgiveness of sins, 
Luk
3:4  as it has been written in the book
of the words of Yeshayahu the prophet, saying, “A voice of one crying in the
wilderness, ‘Prepare the way of יהוה, make His paths
straight.
Luk
3:5  ‘Every valley shall be filled and
every mountain and hill shall be made low, and the crooked shall become
straight, and the rough become smooth ways, 
Luk
3:6  and all flesh shall see the
deliverance of Elohim.’ ” 
Luk
3:7  He said therefore to the crowds that
came out to be immersed by him, “Brood of adders, who warned you to flee from
the wrath to come? 
Luk
3:8  “Therefore bear fruit worthy of
repentance, and do not begin to say to yourselves, ‘We have Aḇraham as
our father.’ For I say to you that Elohim is able to raise up children to Aḇraham
from these stones. 
Luk
3:9  “And even now the axe is laid to the
root of the trees. Therefore every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut
down and thrown into the fire.” 
Luk
3:10  And the crowds asked him, saying, “What,
then, shall we do?” 
Luk
3:11  And answering He said to them, “Let
him who has two undergarments share with him who has none, and let him who has
food do likewise.” 
Luk
3:12  And tax collectors also came to be
immersed, and said to him, “Teacher, what shall we do?” 
Luk
3:13  And he said to them, “Collect no
more than what is appointed for you.” 
Luk
3:14  And soldiers also asked him,
saying, “And what shall we do?” And he said to them, “Do not intimidate anyone
or accuse falsely, and be satisfied with your pay.” 
Luk
3:15  But as the people were in
expectation, and all were reasoning in their hearts about Yoḥanan,
whether he was the Messiah or not, 
Luk
3:16  Yoḥanan answered, saying to
them all, “I indeed immerse you in water, but One mightier than I is coming,
whose sandal straps I am not worthy to loosen. He shall immerse you in the
Set-apart Spirit and fire. 
Luk
3:17  “His winnowing fork is in His hand,
and He shall thoroughly cleanse His threshing-floor, and gather the wheat into
His storehouse, but the chaff He shall burn with unquenchable fire.” 
Luk
3:18  And urging with many other words, he brought the Good News to the
people. 
Luk
3:19  And Herodes the district ruler,
being reproved by him concerning Herodias his brother Philip’s wife, and for
all the wicked deeds which Herodes did, 
Luk
3:20  added this also to them all – he
locked up Yoḥanan in prison. 
Luk
3:21  And it came to be, when all the
people were immersed, יהושע also being immersed,
and praying, the heaven was opened, 
Luk
3:22  and the Set-apart Spirit descended
in bodily form like a dove upon Him, and a voice came from heaven saying, “You
are My Son, the Beloved, in You I did delight.” 
Luk
3:23  And when יהושע
Himself began, He was about thirty years of age, being, as reckoned by law, son
of Yosĕph, of Ĕli, 
Luk
3:24  of Mattithyahu, of Lĕwi, of
Meleḵi, of Yanah, of Yosĕph, 
Luk
3:25  of Mattithyahu, of Amots, of
Naḥum, of Ḥesli, of Noḡah, 
Luk
3:26  of Ma‛ath, of Mattithyahu, of
Shim‛i, of Yosĕph, of Yehuḏah, 
Luk
3:27  of Yoḥanan, of Rephayah, of
Zerubbaḇel, of She’alti’ĕl, of Neri, 
Luk
3:28  of Meleḵi, of Addi, of Qosam,
of Elmoḏam, of Ĕr, 
Luk
3:29  of Yehoshua, of Eli‛ezer, of
Yorim, of Mattithyahu, of Lĕwi, 
Luk
3:30  of Shim‛on, of Yehuḏah,
of Yosĕph, of Yonam, of Elyaqim, 
Luk
3:31  of Melea, of Menna, of Mattattah,
of Nathan, of Dawiḏ, 
Luk
3:32  of Yishai, of Oḇĕḏ,
of Bo‛az, of Salmon, of Naḥshon, 
Luk
3:33  of Amminaḏaḇ, of Ram,
of Ḥetsron, of Perets, of Yehuḏah, 
Luk
3:34  of Ya‛aqoḇ, of
Yitsḥaq, of Aḇraham, of Teraḥ, of Naḥor, 
Luk
3:35  of Seruḡ, of Re‛u, of
Peleḡ, of Ĕḇer, of Shĕlaḥ, 
Luk
3:36  of Qĕynan, of Arpaḵshaḏ,
of Shĕm, of Noaḥ, of Lemeḵ, 
Luk
3:37  of Methushelaḥ, of Ḥanoḵ,
of Yereḏ, of Mahalalĕl, of Qĕynan, 
Luk
3:38  of Enosh, of Shĕth, of Aḏam,
of Elohim. 
Luk
4:1  And יהושע,
being filled with the Set-apart Spirit, returned from the Yardĕn and was
led by the Spirit into the wilderness, 
Luk
4:2  being tried for forty days by the
devil. And in those days He did not eat at all, and afterward, when they had
ended, He was hungry. 
Luk
4:3  And the devil said to Him, “If You
are the Son of Elohim, command this stone to become bread.” 
Luk
4:4  But יהושע
answered him, saying, “It has been written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone,
but by every word of Elohim.’ ”
Luk
4:5  And the devil, taking Him up on a
high mountain, showed Him all the reigns of the world in a moment of time. 
Luk
4:6  And the devil said to Him, “All this
authority I shall give You, and their esteem, for it has been delivered to me,
and I give it to whomever I wish.
Luk
4:7  “If, then, You worship before me,
all shall be Yours.” 
Luk
4:8  And יהושע
answering him, said, “Get behind Me, Satan! For it has been written, ‘You shall
worship יהוה your Elohim, and Him only you shall serve.’
” 
Luk
4:9  And he brought Him to Yerushalayim,
set Him on the edge of the Set-apart Place, and said to Him, “If You are the
Son of Elohim, throw Yourself down from here, 
Luk
4:10  for it has been written, ‘He shall
command His messengers concerning You, to guard over You,’ 
Luk
4:11  and, ‘In their hands they shall
bear You up, lest You dash Your foot against a stone.’ ” 
Luk
4:12  And יהושע
answering, said to him, “It has been said, ‘You shall not try יהוה
your Elohim.’ ” 
Luk
4:13  And when the devil had ended every
trial, he went away from Him until a convenient time. 
Luk
4:14  And יהושע
returned in the power of the Spirit to Galil, and news of Him went out through
all the surrounding country. 
Luk
4:15  And He was teaching in their
congregations, being praised by all. 
Luk
4:16  And He came to Natsareth, where He
had been brought up. And according to His practice, He went into the
congregation on the Sabbath day, and stood up to read. 
Luk
4:17  And the scroll of the prophet
Yeshayahu was handed to Him. And having unrolled the scroll, He found the place
where it was written: 
Luk
4:18  “The Spirit of יהוה
is upon Me, because He has anointed Me to bring the Good News to the poor. He
has sent Me to heal the broken-hearted, to proclaim release to the captives and
recovery of sight to the blind, to send away crushed ones with a release,
Luk
4:19  to proclaim the acceptable year of יהוה.”
Luk
4:20  And having rolled up the scroll, He
gave it back to the attendant and sat down. And the eyes of all in the
congregation were fixed upon Him. 
Luk
4:21  And He began to say to them, “Today
this Scripture has been filled in your hearing.” 
Luk
4:22  And all were bearing witness to
Him, and marvelled at the pleasant words that came out of His mouth. And they
said, “Is this not the son of Yosĕph?” 
Luk
4:23  And He said to them, “No doubt, you
shall say this proverb to Me, ‘Physician, heal yourself! Whatever we have heard
being done in Kephar Naḥum, do also here in Your country.’ ” 
Luk
4:24  And He said, “Truly, I say to you,
no prophet is accepted in his own country. 
Luk
4:25  “But truly I say to you, many
widows were in Yisra’ĕl in the days of Ĕliyahu, when the heaven was
shut up for three years and six months, and there was a great scarcity of food
in all the land, 
Luk
4:26  and Ĕliyahu was sent to none
of them, but to Tsarephath of Tsiḏon, to a woman, a widow. 
Luk
4:27  “And many lepers were in Yisra’ĕl
in the time of Elisha the prophet, and none of them was cleansed except Na‛aman
the Aramean.” 
Luk
4:28  And all those in the congregation,
when they heard this, were filled with wrath. 
Luk
4:29  And rising up they drove Him out of
the city, and brought Him to the brow of the hill on which their city was
built, in order to throw Him down. 
Luk
4:30  But He, passing through the midst
of them, went away. 
Luk
4:31  And He came down to Kephar
Naḥum, a city of Galil, and was teaching them on the Sabbaths. 
Luk
4:32  And they were astonished at His
teaching, for His word was with authority. 
Luk
4:33  And in the congregation was a man
having a spirit of an unclean demon. And he cried out with a loud voice, 
Luk
4:34  saying, “Ha! What have we to do
with You, יהושע of Natsareth? Did You come to
destroy us? I know You, who You are, the Set-apart One of Elohim!” 
Luk
4:35  And יהושע
rebuked him, saying, “Be silenced, and come out of him!” And when the demon had
thrown him in their midst, it came out of him without hurting him. 
Luk
4:36  And astonishment came on all, and
they spoke to each other, saying, “What is this word, that with authority and
power He commands the unclean spirits, and they come out?” 
Luk
4:37  And the report about Him went out
into every place of the neighbourhood. 
Luk
4:38  And rising up from the congregation
He went into the house of Shim‛on. But the mother-in-law of Shim‛on
was sick with a severe inflammation, and they asked Him concerning her. 
Luk
4:39  And standing over her He rebuked
the inflammation, and it left her, and instantly rising up she served them. 
Luk
4:40  And when the sun was setting, all
who had any who were sick with various diseases brought them to Him. And He
laid His hands on each one of them and healed them. 
Luk
4:41  And also demons were coming out of
many, crying out and saying, “You are the Messiah, the Son of Elohim!” And
rebuking them, He did not allow them to speak, for they knew that He was the
Messiah. 
Luk
4:42  And when day came, He went out and
proceeded to a lonely place, but the crowds were seeking Him and came to Him,
and tried to keep Him from leaving them. 
Luk
4:43  And He said to them, “To the other
cities I also have to bring the Good News: the reign of Elohim, because for
this I have been sent.” 
Luk
4:44  And He was proclaiming in the
congregations of Galil. 
Luk
5:1  And it came to be, while the crowd
was pressing upon Him to hear the word of Elohim, that He stood by the Lake of
Gennĕsar, 
Luk
5:2  and He saw two boats standing by the
lake, but the fishermen had gone from them and were washing their nets. 
Luk
5:3  And entering into one of the boats,
which belonged to Shim‛on, He asked him to pull away a little from the
land. And He sat down and was teaching the crowds from the boat. 
Luk
5:4  And when He ceased speaking, He said
to Shim‛on, “Pull out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch.” 
Luk
5:5  And Shim‛on answering, said to
Him, “Master, we have toiled all night and caught none, but at Your word I
shall let down the net.” 
Luk
5:6  And when they did so, they caught a
great number of fish, and their net was breaking, 
Luk
5:7  and they motioned to their partners
in the other boat to come and help them. And they came and filled both the
boats, so that they were sinking. 
Luk
5:8  And when Shim‛on Kĕpha
saw it, he fell down at the knees of יהושע,
saying, “Depart from me, for I am a man, a sinner, O Master!” 
Luk
5:9  For astonishment had seized him and
all those with him, at the catch of fish which they took, 
Luk
5:10  so too were Ya‛aqoḇ and
Yoḥanan, the sons of Zaḇdai, who were partners with Shim‛on.
Then יהושע said to Shim‛on, “Do not fear,
from now on you shall catch men.” 
Luk
5:11  And having brought the boats to
land, they left all and followed Him. 
Luk
5:12  And it came to be when He was in a
certain city, that see, a man covered with leprosy saw יהושע.
And he fell on his face and begged Him, saying, “Master, if You desire, You are
able to cleanse me.” 
Luk
5:13  And He stretched out His hand and
touched him, saying, “I desire it. Be cleansed.” And immediately the leprosy
left him. 
Luk
5:14  And He ordered him to say it to no
one, “But go and show yourself to the priest, and make an offering for your
cleansing, as a witness to them, as Mosheh commanded.” 
Luk
5:15  And the news about Him was
spreading even more. And large crowds were coming together to hear, and to be
healed by Him of their sicknesses. 
Luk
5:16  But He was often withdrawing Himself to lonely places and praying. 
Luk
5:17  And on a certain day it came to be,
as He was teaching, that there were Pharisees and teachers of the Torah sitting
by, who had come out of every village of Galil, Yehuḏah, and
Yerushalayim. And the power of יהוה was there to heal them. 
Luk
5:18  And see, men brought on a bed a man
who was paralysed. And they were seeking to bring him in and lay him before
Him. 
Luk
5:19  But having found no way to bring
him in because of the crowd, they went up on the house-top and let him down
with his bed through the tiles into the midst before יהושע.

Luk
5:20  And having seen their belief, He
said to him, “Man, your sins are forgiven you.” 
Luk
5:21  And the scribes and the Pharisees
began to reason, saying, “Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who is able to
forgive sins except Elohim alone?” 
Luk
5:22  And יהושע,
knowing their thoughts, answering, said to them, “Why are you reasoning in your
hearts? 
Luk
5:23  “Which is easier, to say, ‘Your
sins are forgiven you,’ or to say, ‘Rise up and walk’? 
Luk
5:24  “But in order for you to know that
the Son of Aḏam possesses authority on earth to forgive sins...” He said
to the man who was paralysed, “I say to you, rise, take up your bed, and go to
your house.” 
Luk
5:25  And at once, having risen up before
them, he took up what he had been lying on, and went away to his house,
praising Elohim. 
Luk
5:26  And astonishment seized them all,
and they praised Elohim and were filled with fear, saying, “We have seen
extra-ordinary feats today!” 
Luk
5:27  And after this He went out and saw
a tax collector named Lĕwi, sitting at the tax office, and said to him, “Follow
Me.” 
Luk
5:28  And he, having left all, rose up
and followed Him. 
Luk
5:29  And Lĕwi made a great feast
for Him in his house. And there were a great number of tax collectors and
others who sat down with them. 
Luk
5:30  And the Pharisees and their scribes
grumbled against His taught ones, saying, “Why do You eat and drink with tax
collectors and sinners?” 
Luk
5:31  And יהושע
answering, said to them, “Those who are well do not need a physician, but those
who are sick. 
Luk
5:32  “I have not come to call the
righteous, but sinners, to repentance.” 
Luk
5:33  And they said to Him, “Why do the
taught ones of Yoḥanan fast often and make prayers, and likewise those of
the Pharisees, but Yours eat and drink?” 
Luk
5:34  And He said to them, “Are you able
to make the friends of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them? 
Luk
5:35  “But days shall come when the
bridegroom is taken away from them, then they shall fast in those days.” 
Luk
5:36  And He also spoke a parable to
them, “No one puts a piece from a fresh garment on an old one, otherwise the
fresh one makes a tear, and also the piece that was taken out of the fresh one
does not match the old. 
Luk
5:37  “And no one puts new wine into old
wineskins, otherwise the new wine shall burst the wineskins and run out, and
the wineskins shall be ruined. 
Luk
5:38  “But new wine is put into fresh
wineskins, and both are preserved. 
Luk
5:39  “And no one, having drunk old wine,
immediately desires new wine, for he
says, ‘The old is better.’ ” 
Luk
6:1  And it came to be on a Sabbath that
He went through grainfields, and His taught ones were plucking the heads of
grain and were eating, rubbing them in the hands. 
Luk
6:2  And some of the Pharisees said to
them, “Why are you doing what is not right to do on the Sabbath?” 
Luk
6:3  And יהושע
answering them, said, “Have you not read what Dawiḏ did when he was
hungry, he and those who were with him, 
Luk
6:4  how he went into the House of
Elohim, took and ate the showbread, and also gave some to those with him, which
is not right for any but the priests to eat?” 
Luk
6:5  And He said to them, “The Son of Aḏam
is Master of the Sabbath.”
Luk
6:6  And it also came to be on another
Sabbath, that He entered into the congregation and taught, and there was a man
whose right hand was withered. 
Luk
6:7  And the scribes and Pharisees were
watching Him closely, whether He would heal on the Sabbath, for them to find an
accusation against Him. 
Luk
6:8  And He knew their thoughts, and said
to the man who had the withered hand, “Rise and stand in the midst.” And he
rose up and stood. 
Luk
6:9  Then יהושע
said to them, “I ask you, is it right to do good on the Sabbath, or to do evil,
to save life or to destroy it?” 
Luk
6:10  And looking around at them all, He
said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” And he did so, and his hand was
restored sound as the other. 
Luk
6:11  But they were filled with folly,
and were speaking with one another what they should do to יהושע.

Luk
6:12  And in those days it came to be
that He went out to the mountain to pray, and was spending the night in prayer
to Elohim. 
Luk
6:13  And when it became day, He called
near His taught ones and chose from them twelve, whom He also named emissaries:

Luk
6:14  Shim‛on whom He also named Kĕpha,
and his brother Andri, Ya‛aqoḇ and Yoḥanan, Philip and
Bartholomi, 
Luk
6:15  Mattithyahu and T’oma, Ya‛aqoḇ
the son of Alphai and Shim‛on,
the one called the Ardent One, 
Luk
6:16  Yehuḏah the son of Ya‛aqoḇ and Yehuḏah
from Qerioth who also became the betrayer. 
Luk
6:17  And coming down with them He stood
on a level place with a crowd of His taught ones and a great number of people
from all Yehuḏah and Yerushalayim, and from the coast country of Tsor and
Tsiḏon, who came to hear Him, and to be healed of their diseases,  
Luk
6:18  and those who were troubled with
unclean spirits – and they were healed. 
Luk
6:19  And all the crowd were seeking to
touch Him, for power went out from Him, and healing them all. 
Luk
6:20  And He, lifting up His eyes toward
His taught ones, said, “Blessed are the poor, because yours is the reign of
Elohim.
Luk
6:21  “Blessed are you who hunger now,
because you shall be satisfied. Blessed are you who weep now, because you shall
laugh. 
Luk
6:22  “Blessed are you when men shall
hate you, and when they shall cut you off, and shall reproach you, and cast out
your name as wicked, for the sake of the Son of Aḏam. 
Luk
6:23  “Rejoice in that day and leap for
joy, for look, your reward is great in the heaven, for that is how their
fathers treated the prophets. 
Luk
6:24  “But woe to you who are rich,
because you are receiving your comfort. 
Luk
6:25  “Woe to you who have been filled,
because you shall hunger. Woe to you who are laughing now, because you shall
mourn and weep. 
Luk
6:26  “Woe to you when all men speak well
of you, for thus their fathers did to the false prophets. 
Luk
6:27  “But I say to you who are hearing:
Love your enemies, do good to those hating you. 
Luk
6:28  “Bless those cursing you, and pray
for those insulting you. 
Luk
6:29  “And to him who hits you on the one
cheek, offer the other also. And from him who takes away your outer garment, do
not withhold the inner garment either. 
Luk
6:30  “And give to everyone who asks of you.
And from him who takes away what is yours do not ask it back. 
Luk
6:31  “And as you wish men should do to
you, you also do to them in the same way. 
Luk
6:32  “And if you love those loving you,
what favour have you? For sinners, too, love those loving them. 
Luk
6:33  “And if you do good to those doing
good to you, what favour have you? For even sinners do the same. 
Luk
6:34  “And if you lend to those from whom you expect to receive
back, what favour have you? For even sinners lend to sinners to receive as much
back. 
Luk
6:35  “Rather, love your enemies, and do
good, and lend, expecting none in return. And your reward shall be great, and
you shall be sons of the Most High. Because He is kind to the thankless and
wicked ones.
Luk
6:36  “Therefore be compassionate, as
your Father also is compassionate. 
Luk
6:37  “And do not judge, and you shall
not be judged at all. Condemn not, and you shall not be condemned at all.
Forgive, and you shall be forgiven. 
Luk
6:38  “Give, and it shall be given to
you. A good measure, pressed down and shaken together and running over shall be
put into your lap. For with the same measure with which you measure, it shall
be measured back to you.” 
Luk
6:39  And He spoke a parable to them, “Is
a blind able to lead a blind? Shall they not both fall into a pit? 
Luk
6:40  “A taught one is not above his
teacher, but everyone perfected shall be like his teacher. 
Luk
6:41  “And why do you see the splinter in
your brother’s eye, but are not aware of the plank in your own eye? 
Luk
6:42  “Or how are you able to say to your
brother, ‘Brother, let me take out the splinter that is in your eye,’ not
seeing the plank in your own eye? Hypocrite, first take the plank out of your
own eye, and then you shall see clearly to take out the splinter that is in
your brother’s eye. 
Luk
6:43  “For a good tree does not yield
rotten fruit, nor does a rotten tree yield good fruit. 
Luk
6:44  “For each tree is known by its own
fruit. For they do not gather figs from thorns, nor do they gather grapes from a
bramble bush. 
Luk
6:45  “The good man brings forth what is
good out of the good treasure of his heart, and the wicked man brings forth
what is wicked out of the wicked treasure of his heart. For out of the overflow
of the heart his mouth speaks. 
Luk
6:46  “But why do you call Me ‘Master,
Master,’ and do not do what I say?
Luk
6:47  “Everyone who is coming to Me, and
is hearing My words and is doing them, I shall show you whom he is like: 
Luk
6:48  “He is like a man building a house,
who dug deep and laid a foundation on the rock. And when a flood came, the
stream burst against that house, but was unable to shake it, for it was founded
on the rock. 
Luk
6:49  “But the one hearing and not doing,
is like a man who built a house on the earth without a foundation, against
which the stream burst, and immediately it fell. And the ruin of that house was
great.” 
Luk
7:1  And when He completed all His words
in the hearing of the people, He went into Kephar Naḥum. 
Luk
7:2  And a certain captain’s servant, who
was valuable to him, was sick and about to die. 
Luk
7:3  And hearing about יהושע,
he sent elders of the Yehuḏim to Him, asking Him to come and heal his
servant. 
Luk
7:4  And when they came to יהושע,
they begged Him earnestly, saying, “He is worthy for You to grant this to him, 
Luk
7:5  for he loves our nation, and has
built the congregation for us.” 
Luk
7:6  So יהושע
went with them. However, He was not far from the house when the captain sent
friends to Him, saying to Him, “Master, do not trouble Yourself, for I am not
worthy that You should come under my roof. 
Luk
7:7  “For this reason I did not even
think myself worthy to come to You. But say a word, and my servant shall be
healed. 
Luk
7:8  “For I too am a man appointed under
authority, having soldiers under me. And I say to one, ‘Go,’ and he goes, and
to another, ‘Come,’ and he comes, and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”

Luk
7:9  And when יהושע
heard this, He marvelled at him, and turned around and said to the crowd that
followed Him, “I say to you, not even in Yisra’ĕl have I found such great
belief!” 
Luk
7:10  And those who were sent, returning
to the house, found the servant who had been sick in good health. 
Luk
7:11  And it came to be the next day,
that He went into a city called Na‛im. And many of His taught ones went
with Him, and a large crowd. 
Luk
7:12  And see, as He came near the gate
of the city a dead man was being carried out, the only son of his mother, and
she was a widow. And a large crowd from the city was with her. 
Luk
7:13  And when the Master saw her, He had
compassion on her and said to her, “Do not weep.” 
Luk
7:14  And coming near He touched the
bier, and those bearing it stood still. And He said, “Young man, I say to you,
arise.” 
Luk
7:15  And he who was dead sat up and
began to speak, and He gave him to his mother. 
Luk
7:16  And fear seized all, and they
praised Elohim, saying, “A great prophet has been raised up among us,” and, “Elohim
has visited His people.” 
Luk
7:17  And this news about Him went out in
all Yehuḏah and all the neighbourhood. 
Luk
7:18  And the taught ones of
Yoḥanan reported to him about all this. 
Luk
7:19  And Yoḥanan, calling two of
his taught ones near, sent to יהושע, saying, “Are
You the Coming One, or should we look for another?” 
Luk
7:20  And coming to Him, the men said, “Yoḥanan
the Immerser has sent us to You, saying, ‘Are You the Coming One, or should we
look for another?’ ” 
Luk
7:21  And in the same hour He healed many
of diseases, and afflictions, and wicked spirits. And He gave sight to many
blind ones. 
Luk
7:22  And יהושע
answering, said to them, “Go, report to Yoḥanan what you have seen and
heard: blind receive sight, lame do walk, lepers are cleansed, deaf do hear,
dead are raised, the Good News is brought to the poor. 
Luk
7:23  “And blessed is he who shall not
stumble in Me.” 
Luk
7:24  And when the messengers of
Yoḥanan had left, He began to speak to the crowds concerning
Yoḥanan, “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken
by the wind? 
Luk
7:25  “But what did you go out to see? A
man dressed in soft garments? Look, those who are splendidly dressed and living
in luxury are in the houses of sovereigns. 
Luk
7:26  “But what did you go out to see? A
prophet? Yea, I say to you, and more than a prophet. 
Luk
7:27  “This is he concerning whom it has
been written, ‘See, I send My messenger before Your face, who shall prepare
Your way before You.’ 
Luk
7:28  “For I say to you, among those born
of women there is not a greater prophet than Yoḥanan the Immerser, but he
who is least in the reign of Elohim is greater than he.” 
Luk
7:29  And all the people, even the tax
collectors, when they heard, declared Elohim righteous, having been immersed
with the immersion of Yoḥanan. 
Luk
7:30  But the Pharisees and those learned
in the Torah rejected the counsel of Elohim for themselves, not having been
immersed by him. 
Luk
7:31  And the Master said, “To what then
shall I compare the men of this generation, and what are they like? 
Luk
7:32  “They are like children sitting in
the market-place and calling to each other, saying, ‘We played the flute for
you and you did not dance, we lamented for you and you did not weep.’ 
Luk
7:33  “For Yoḥanan the Immerser
came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, ‘He has a demon.’ 
Luk
7:34  “The Son of Aḏam has come
eating and drinking, and you say, ‘Look, a man, a glutton and a winedrinker, a
friend of tax collectors and sinners!’ 
Luk
7:35  “And wisdom is declared right by
all her children.” 
Luk
7:36  And one of the Pharisees asked Him
to eat with him. And He went into the Pharisee’s house, and sat down to eat. 
Luk
7:37  And see, a woman in the city who
was a sinner, when she knew that יהושע sat at the
table in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster flask of perfume. 
Luk
7:38  And standing behind, at His feet,
weeping, she began to wet His feet with her tears, and wiping them with the
hair of her head, and was kissing His feet and anointing them with the perfume.

Luk
7:39  And when the Pharisee who had
invited Him saw this, he spoke to himself, saying, “This One, if He were a
prophet, would know who and what kind of woman this is who is touching Him, for
she is a sinner.” 
Luk
7:40  And יהושע
answering, said to him, “Shim‛on, I have somewhat to say to you.” And he
said, “Teacher, say it.” 
Luk
7:41  “A certain creditor had two
debtors. The one owed five hundred pieces of silver, and the other fifty. 
Luk
7:42  “And when they were unable to
repay, he forgave them both. Which of them, then, shall love him more?” 
Luk
7:43  And Shim‛on answering, said, “I
suppose the one whom he forgave more.” And He said to him, “You have rightly
judged.” 
Luk
7:44  And turning to the woman He said to
Shim‛on, “Do you see this woman? I came into your house – you gave Me no
water for My feet, but she has wetted My feet with her tears and wiped them
with the hair of her head. 
Luk
7:45  “You gave Me no kiss, but she has
not ceased to kiss My feet since the time I came in. 
Luk
7:46  “You did not anoint My head with
oil, but she anointed My feet with perfume. 
Luk
7:47  “Therefore I say to you, her many
sins have been forgiven, because she loved much. But to whom little is
forgiven, he loves little.” 
Luk
7:48  And He said to her, “Your sins have
been forgiven.” 
Luk
7:49  And those who were sitting at the
table with Him began to say among themselves, “Who is this who even forgives
sins?” 
Luk
7:50  And He said to the woman, “Your
belief has saved you. Go in peace.” 
Luk
8:1  And it came to be, afterward, that
He went through every city and village, proclaiming and bringing the Good News
of the reign of Elohim, and the twelve were with Him, 
Luk
8:2  and certain women who were healed of
wicked spirits and sicknesses: Miryam, called ‘from Maḡdala,’ out of whom
had come seven demons, 
Luk
8:3  and Yoḥanah the wife of Kuza,
manager of Herodes, and Shoshannah, and many others who provided for Him from
their resources. 
Luk
8:4  And when a large crowd had gathered,
and those who were coming to Him from every city, He spoke by a parable: 
Luk
8:5  “A sower went out to sow his seed.
And as he sowed, some indeed fell by the wayside. And it was trodden down, and
the birds of the heaven devoured it. 
Luk
8:6  “And other fell on rock, and when it
grew up, it withered because it had no moisture. 
Luk
8:7  “And other fell among thorns, and
the thorns grew up with it and choked it. 
Luk
8:8  “And other fell on the good soil,
and grew up, and yielded a crop a hundredfold.” Having said this He cried, “He
who has ears to hear, let him hear!” 
Luk
8:9  And His taught ones were asking Him,
saying, “What does this parable mean?” 
Luk
8:10  And He said, “To you it has been
given to know the secrets of the reign of Elohim, but to the rest in parables,
that ‘Seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not understand.’ 
Luk
8:11  “And this is the parable: The seed
is the word of Elohim.
Luk
8:12  “And those by the wayside are the
ones who hear, then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts,
lest having believed, they should be saved. 
Luk
8:13  “And those on the rock are those
who, when they hear, receive the word with joy. And these have no root, who
believe for a while and in time of trial fall away. 
Luk
8:14  “And that which fell among thorns
are those who, when they have heard, go out and are choked with worries, and
riches, and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit to perfection. 
Luk
8:15  “And that on the good soil are
those who, having heard the word with a noble and good heart, retain it, and
bear fruit with endurance. 
Luk
8:16  “And no one having lit a lamp,
covers it with a vessel or puts it under a bed, but he puts it on a lampstand,
so that those coming in see the light. 
Luk
8:17  “For whatever is hidden shall be
revealed, and whatever is secret shall be known and come to light. 
Luk
8:18  “Therefore take heed how you hear.
For whoever possesses, to him more
shall be given; and whoever does not possess, even what he thinks he possesses
shall be taken from him.” 
Luk
8:19  And His mother and brothers came to
Him, and were unable to get to Him because of the crowd. 
Luk
8:20  And it was reported to Him, saying,
“Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside, wishing to see You.” 
Luk
8:21  And He answering, said to them, “My
mother and My brothers are those who are hearing the Word of Elohim and doing
it.”
Luk
8:22  And on a certain day it came to be,
that He entered into a boat with His taught ones, and He said to them, “Let us
go over to the other side of the lake.” And they set out. 
Luk
8:23  And as they were sailing He fell
asleep. And a windstorm came down on the lake, and they were filling up, and
were in danger. 
Luk
8:24  And they came to Him and woke Him
up, saying, “Master, Master, we are perishing!” And He awoke and rebuked the
wind and the raging of the water. And they ceased, and there came a calm. 
Luk
8:25  And He said to them, “Where is your
belief?” And they were afraid, and marvelled, saying to one another, “Who then
is this, that He even commands the winds and water, and they obey Him?” 
Luk
8:26  And they sailed to the country of
the Gaḏarenes, which is opposite Galil. 
Luk
8:27  And as He went out onto the land,
He was met by a certain man, from the city, who had demons for a long time. And
he wore no garments, and he was not living in a house but in the tombs. 
Luk
8:28  And when he saw יהושע,
he cried out, fell down before Him, and with a loud voice said, “What have I to
do with You, יהושע, Son of the Most High Elohim?
I beg You, do not torture me!” 
Luk
8:29  For He had commanded the unclean
spirit to come out of the man. For it had seized him many times, and he was
bound with chains and shackles, being guarded. And breaking the bonds, he was
driven by the demon into the lonely places. 
Luk
8:30  And יהושע
asked him, saying, “What is your name?” And he said, “Legion,” because many
demons had entered into him. 
Luk
8:31  And they were begging Him that He
would not command them to go out into the bottomless pit. 
Luk
8:32  And a herd of many pigs was feeding
there on the mountain. And they begged Him to allow them to go into them. And
He allowed them. 
Luk
8:33  And the demons, having gone out of
the man, entered into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep place into
the lake and drowned. 
Luk
8:34  And when those feeding them saw
what had taken place, they fled and reported it in the city and in the country.

Luk
8:35  So they came out to see what had
taken place, and came to יהושע, and found the man
from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at the feet of יהושע,
dressed, and in his right mind. And they were afraid. 
Luk
8:36  And those who had seen it reported
to them how he who had been possessed by demons was healed. 
Luk
8:37  And all the crowd of the neighbourhood
of the Gaḏarenes asked Him to leave them, for they were seized with great
fear. And He entered into the boat and returned. 
Luk
8:38  And the man from whom the demons
had gone out was begging Him to be with Him. But יהושע
sent him away, saying, 
Luk
8:39  “Go back to your house, and relate
what Elohim has done for you.” And he went away proclaiming through all the
city what יהושע did for him. 
Luk
8:40  And it came to be, when יהושע
returned, that the crowd gladly received Him, for they were all looking for
Him. 
Luk
8:41  And see, there came a man whose
name was Ya’ir, and he was a ruler of the congregation. And falling down at the
feet of יהושע he was calling upon Him to come to
his house, 
Luk
8:42  because he had an only daughter
about twelve years of age, and she was dying. And as He went, the crowds
thronged upon Him. 
Luk
8:43  And a woman, having a flow of blood
for twelve years, who, having spent all her livelihood on physicians, was
unable to be healed by any, 
Luk
8:44  came from behind and touched the
tzitzit of His garment. And immediately her flow of blood stopped. 
Luk
8:45  And יהושע
said, “Who touched Me?” And when all denied it, Kĕpha and those with him
said, “Master, the crowds throng You and press upon You, and You say, ‘Who
touched Me?’ ” 
Luk
8:46  But יהושע
said, “Somebody did touch Me, for I knew power went out from Me.” 
Luk
8:47  And the woman, seeing that she was
not hidden, came trembling, and falling down before Him she declared to Him in
the presence of all the people why she had touched Him and how she was healed
immediately. 
Luk
8:48  And He said to her, “Take courage,
daughter, your belief has healed you. Go in peace.” 
Luk
8:49  While He was still speaking,
someone came from the ruler of the congregation’s house, saying to him, “Your daughter is dead. Do not trouble the
Teacher any further.” 
Luk
8:50  And יהושע,
having heard, answered him, saying, “Do not be afraid, only believe, and she
shall be healed.” 
Luk
8:51  And coming into the house, He
allowed no one to go in except Kĕpha, and Ya‛aqoḇ, and
Yoḥanan, and the girl’s father and mother. 
Luk
8:52  And they were all weeping and
mourning for her, and He said, “Do not weep, she is not dead, but sleeps.” 
Luk
8:53  And they were laughing at Him,
knowing that she was dead. 
Luk
8:54  But taking her by the hand He
called, saying, “Child, arise.” 
Luk
8:55  And her spirit returned, and she
rose up immediately. And He directed that she be given food to eat. 
Luk
8:56  And her parents were astonished,
but He ordered them to say to no one what had taken place. 
Luk
9:1  And having called His twelve taught
ones together, He gave them power and authority over all demons, and to heal
diseases. 
Luk
9:2  And He sent them to proclaim the
reign of Elohim and to heal the sick. 
Luk
9:3  And He said to them, “Take no matter at all for the journey, neither
staffs nor bag nor bread nor money – neither have two undergarments. 
Luk
9:4  “And whatever house you enter, stay
there, and go out from there. 
Luk
9:5  “And as for those who do not receive
you, when you go out of that city, shake off the dust from your feet as a
witness against them.” 
Luk
9:6  And going out they went through the
villages, bringing the Good News and healing everywhere. 
Luk
9:7  And Herodes the district ruler heard
of all that was done by Him, and was perplexed, because it was said by some
that Yoḥanan had been raised from the dead, 
Luk
9:8  and by some that Ĕliyahu had
appeared, and by others that one of the old prophets has risen up. 
Luk
9:9  And Herodes said, “Yoḥanan I
have beheaded, but who is this of whom I hear such reports?” And he was seeking to see Him. 
Luk
9:10  And the emissaries, when they had
returned, related to Him all that they had done. And He took them and they
withdrew by themselves to a city called Bĕyth Tsaiḏa. 
Luk
9:11  And when the crowds knew it, they
followed Him. And having received them, He was speaking to them about the reign
of Elohim, and healed those who had need of healing. 
Luk
9:12  And as the day began to decline,
the twelve came and said to Him, “Send the crowd away, that going into the
surrounding villages and country, they might lodge and get food, because here
we are in a lonely place.” 
Luk
9:13  But He said to them, “You give them
to eat.” And they said, “We have no more than five loaves and two fishes,
unless we go and buy food for all these people.” 
Luk
9:14  For there were about five thousand
men. And He said to His taught ones, “Make them sit down in groups of fifty.” 
Luk
9:15  And they did so, and made them all
sit down. 
Luk
9:16  And taking the five loaves and the
two fishes, having looked up to the heaven, He blessed and broke them, and gave
them to the taught ones to set before the crowd. 
Luk
9:17  So they all ate and were satisfied,
and twelve baskets of the broken pieces were picked up by them. 
Luk
9:18  And it came to be, as He was alone
praying, the taught ones were with Him, and He asked them, saying, “Who do the
crowds say that I am?” 
Luk
9:19  And they answering, said, “Yoḥanan
the Immerser, but others Ĕliyahu, and others say that one of the old
prophets has risen up.” 
Luk
9:20  And He said to them, “And you, who
do you say I am?” And Kĕpha answering, said, “The Messiah of Elohim.” 
Luk
9:21  And strictly warning them, He
commanded them to say this to no one, 
Luk
9:22  saying, “The Son of Aḏam has
to suffer much, and to be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes,
and to be killed, and to be raised the third day.” 
Luk
9:23  And He said to them all, “If anyone
wishes to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his stake daily, and
follow Me. 
Luk
9:24  “For whoever wishes to save his
life shall lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake shall save it. 
Luk
9:25  “For what is a man profited if he gains
all the world, and is himself destroyed or lost? 
Luk
9:26  “For whoever is ashamed of Me and
My words, of him the Son of Aḏam shall be ashamed when He comes in His
esteem, and in His Father’s, and of the set-apart messengers. 
Luk
9:27  “But truly I say to you, there are
some standing here who shall not taste death at all till they see the reign of
Elohim:” 
Luk
9:28  And it came to be, about eight days
after these words, taking with Him Kĕpha and Yoḥanan and Ya‛aqoḇ,
He went up to the mountain to pray. 
Luk
9:29  And it came to be, as He prayed,
the appearance of His face changed, and His garment dazzling white. 
Luk
9:30  And see, two men were talking with
Him, who were Mosheh and Ĕliyahu,
Luk
9:31  who having appeared in esteem,
spoke of His death which He was about to complete at Yerushalayim. 
Luk
9:32  But Kĕpha and those with him
were heavy with sleep. And having awakened, they saw His esteem and the two men
standing with Him. 
Luk
9:33  And it came to be, as they were
parting from Him, Kĕpha said to יהושע, “Master,
it is good for us to be here. And let us make three booths: one for You, and
one for Mosheh, and one for Ĕliyahu,” not knowing what he said. 
Luk
9:34  And as he was saying this, a cloud
came and overshadowed them. And they were afraid as they entered the cloud. 
Luk
9:35  And a voice came out of the cloud,
saying, “This is My Son, the Beloved. Hear Him!” 
Luk
9:36  And when the voice had spoken, יהושע
was found alone. And they were silent, and reported to no one in those days any
of what they had seen. 
Luk
9:37  And it came to be on the next day,
when they came down from the mountain, that a large crowd met Him. 
Luk
9:38  And see, a man from the crowd cried
out, saying, “Teacher, I beg You, look at my son, for he is my only child. 
Luk
9:39  “And see, a spirit seizes him, and
he suddenly cries out, and it convulses him, with foaming, and scarcely leaves
him, bruising him. 
Luk
9:40  “And I begged Your taught ones to
cast it out, but they were unable.” 
Luk
9:41  And יהושע
answering, said, “O generation, unbelieving and perverse, how long shall I be
with you and put up with you? Bring your son here.” 
Luk
9:42  And as he was still coming, the
demon threw him down in convulsions. And יהושע rebuked
the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and gave him back to his father. 
Luk
9:43  And they were all amazed at the
greatness of Elohim. And while all were marvelling at all that יהושע
did, He said to His taught ones, 
Luk
9:44  “Lay up in your ears these words,
for the Son of Aḏam is about to be delivered into the hands of men.” 
Luk
9:45  But they did not understand this
saying, and it was veiled from them so that they did not perceive it. And they
were afraid to ask Him about this saying. 
Luk
9:46  And a reasoning arose among them,
who might be the greater of them. 
Luk
9:47  And יהושע,
having seen the reasoning of their heart, took a little child and placed him by
His side, 
Luk
9:48  and said to them, “Whoever receives
this little child in My Name receives Me. And whoever receives Me receives Him
who sent Me. For he who is least among you all, he shall be great.” 
Luk
9:49  And Yoḥanan answering, said, “Master,
we saw someone casting out demons in Your Name, and we forbade him because he
does not follow with us.” 
Luk
9:50  But יהושע
said to him, “Do not forbid him, for he who is not against us is for us.” 
Luk
9:51  And it came to be, when the days of
His taking up were being completed, even He set His face to go to Yerushalayim,

Luk
9:52  and He sent messengers ahead of
Him. And they went and entered into a village of the Shomeronites, to prepare
for Him. 
Luk
9:53  And they did not receive Him,
because His face was set for the journey to Yerushalayim. 
Luk
9:54  And His taught ones, Ya‛aqoḇ
and Yoḥanan, seeing it said, “Master, do You wish us to command fire to
come down from the heaven and destroy them, as also Ĕliyahu did?” 
Luk
9:55  But having turned, He rebuked them
and said, “You do not know of what spirit you are, 
Luk
9:56  for the Son of Aḏam did not
come to destroy men’s lives but to save them.” And they went on to another
village. 
Luk
9:57  And it came to be, as they
journeyed on the way, that someone said to Him, “Master, I shall follow You
wherever You go.” 
Luk
9:58  And יהושע
said to him, “The foxes have holes and the birds of the heaven nests, but the
Son of Aḏam has nowhere to lay His head.” 
Luk
9:59  And He said to another, “Follow Me,”
but he said, “Master, let me first go and bury my father.” 
Luk
9:60  And יהושע
said to him, “Let the dead bury their own dead, but you go and announce the
reign of Elohim.” 
Luk
9:61  And another also said, “Master, I
shall follow You, but let me first say good-bye to those in my house.” 
Luk
9:62  But יהושע
said to him, “No one, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is
fit for the reign of Elohim.”
Luk
10:1  And after this the Master appointed
seventy others, and sent them two by two ahead of Him into every city and place
where He Himself was about to go. 
Luk
10:2  Then He said to them, “The harvest
indeed is great, but the workers are few, therefore pray the Master of the
harvest to send out workers into His harvest. 
Luk
10:3  “Go! See, I send you out as lambs
into the midst of wolves. 
Luk
10:4  “Do not take a purse, nor a bag,
nor sandals. And greet no one along the way. 
Luk
10:5  “And whatever house you enter,
first say, ‘Peace to this house.’ 
Luk
10:6  “And if indeed a son of peace is
there, your peace shall rest on it; and if not, it shall return to you. 
Luk
10:7  “And stay in the same house, eating
and drinking whatever with them, for the labourer is worthy of his wages. Do
not move from house to house. 
Luk
10:8  “And into whatever city you enter,
and they receive you, eat whatever is placed before you, 
Luk
10:9  and heal the sick there, and say to
them, ‘The reign of Elohim has come near to you.’ 
Luk
10:10  “And into whatever city you enter,
and they do not receive you, go out into its streets and say, 
Luk
10:11  ‘Even the dust of your city which
clings to us, we wipe off against you, but know this, that the reign of Elohim
has come near to you.’ 
Luk
10:12  “And I say to you that it shall be
more bearable for Seḏom in that Day, than for that city. 
Luk
10:13  “Woe to you, Korazin! Woe to you,
Bĕyth Tsaiḏa! For if the miracles which were done in you had been
done in Tsor and Tsiḏon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in
sackcloth and ashes. 
Luk
10:14  “But it shall be more bearable for
Tsor and Tsiḏon at the judgment than for you. 
Luk
10:15  “And you, Kephar Naḥum, who
are exalted to the heaven, shall be brought down to the grave. 
Luk
10:16  “He who hears you hears Me, he who
rejects you rejects Me, and he who rejects Me rejects Him who sent Me.” 
Luk
10:17  And the seventy returned with joy,
saying, “Master, even the demons are subject to us in Your Name.” 
Luk
10:18  And He said to them, “I saw Satan
falling out of the heaven as lightning. 
Luk
10:19  “See, I give you the authority to
trample on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and
none at all shall hurt you. 
Luk
10:20  “But do not rejoice in this, that
the spirits are subject to you, but rather rejoice because your names have been
written in the heavens.” 
Luk
10:21  In that hour יהושע
exulted in the Spirit and said, “I praise You, Father, Master of the heaven and
of the earth, that You have hidden these matters
from clever and learned ones, and did reveal them to babes. Yea, Father,
because thus it was well-pleasing in Your sight. 
Luk
10:22  “All has been delivered to Me by
My Father, and no one knows who the Son is, except the Father, and who the
Father is, except the Son, and he to whom the Son wishes to reveal Him.” 
Luk
10:23  And turning to His taught ones He
said, separately, “Blessed are the eyes that see what you see, 
Luk
10:24  for I say to you that many
prophets and sovereigns have wished to see what you see, and have not seen it,
and to hear what you hear, and have not heard it.” 
Luk
10:25  And see, a certain one learned in
the Torah stood up, trying Him, and saying, “Teacher, what shall I do to
inherit everlasting life?” 
Luk
10:26  And He said to him, “What has been
written in the Torah? How do you read it?” 
Luk
10:27  And he answering, said, “ ‘You
shall love יהוה your Elohim with all your heart, and
with all your being, and with all your strength, and with all your mind,’ and ‘your
neighbour as yourself.’ ” 
Luk
10:28  And He said to him, “You have
answered rightly. Do this and you shall live.”
Luk
10:29  But he, wishing to declare himself
righteous, said to יהושע, “And who is my
neighbour?” 
Luk
10:30  And replying, יהושע
said, “A certain man was going down from Yerushalayim to Yeriḥo, and fell
among robbers, who, both stripping and beating him, went away, leaving him half
dead. 
Luk
10:31  “And by a coincidence a certain
priest was going down that way. And when he saw him, he passed by on the other
side. 
Luk
10:32  “And likewise a Lĕwite also,
when he came to the place, and seeing, passed by on the other side. 
Luk
10:33  “But a certain Shomeronite,
journeying, came upon him. And when he saw him, he had compassion on him, 
Luk
10:34  and he went to him and bandaged
his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. And having placed him on his own beast, he
brought him to an inn, and looked after him. 
Luk
10:35  “And going out on the next day, he
took out two pieces of silver, gave them to the innkeeper, and said to him, ‘Look
after him, and whatever more you spend I shall repay you when I return.’ 
Luk
10:36  “Who, then, of these three, do you
think, was neighbour to him who fell among the robbers?”
Luk
10:37  And he said, “He who showed
compassion on him.” Then יהושע said to him, “Go
and do likewise.” 
Luk
10:38  And it came to be as they went
that He entered into a certain village. And a certain woman named Martha
received Him into her house. 
Luk
10:39  And she had a sister called
Miryam, who also sat at the feet of יהושע and
heard His word. 
Luk
10:40  But Martha was distracted with
much serving, and coming up she said, “Master, are You not concerned that my
sister has left me to serve alone? Speak to her then, to help me.” 
Luk
10:41  And יהושע
answering, said to her, “Martha, Martha, you are worried and troubled about
many matters, 
Luk
10:42  but one only is necessary, and
Miryam has chosen the good portion, which shall not be taken away from her.” 
Luk
11:1  And it came to be while He was
praying in a certain place, as He ceased, one of His taught ones said to Him, “Master,
teach us to pray, as Yoḥanan also taught his taught ones.” 
Luk
11:2  And He said to them, “When you
pray, say: Our Father in the heavens, let Your Name be set-apart, let Your
reign come, let Your desire be done on earth as it is in heaven. 
Luk
11:3  “Give us day by day our daily
bread. 
Luk
11:4  “And forgive us our sins, for we
also forgive everyone who is indebted to us. And do not lead us into trial, but
rescue us from the wicked one.” 
Luk
11:5  And He said to them, “Which of you
shall have a friend, and go to him at midnight and say to him, ‘Friend, lend me
three loaves, 
Luk
11:6  since a friend of mine has come to
me on his journey, and I do not have food
to set before him,’ 
Luk
11:7  then the one inside answering,
says, ‘Do not trouble me, the door is already locked, and my children with me
are in bed. I am unable to get up and give to you’? 
Luk
11:8  “I say to you, if he does not get
up and give to him because he is his friend, he shall get up and give him as
many as he needs because of his persistence. 
Luk
11:9  “And I say to you: ask and it shall
be given to you, seek and you shall find, knock and it shall be opened to you. 
Luk
11:10  “For everyone asking receives, and
he who is seeking finds, and to him who is knocking it shall be opened. 
Luk
11:11  “And what father among you whose
son asks for bread shall give him a stone, or if he asks for a fish shall give
him a snake instead of a fish, 
Luk
11:12  or if he asks for an egg shall
give him a scorpion? 
Luk
11:13  “If you then, being wicked, know
how to give good gifts to your children, how much more shall your Father from
heaven give the Set-apart Spirit to those asking Him!” 
Luk
11:14  And He was casting out a demon,
and it was dumb. And it came to be, when the demon had gone out, that the dumb
spoke. And the crowds marvelled. 
Luk
11:15  But some of them said, “He casts
out demons by Be‛elzebul, the ruler of the demons,” 
Luk
11:16  and others, trying Him, were seeking from Him a sign from
heaven. 
Luk
11:17  And He, knowing their thoughts,
said to them, “Every reign divided against itself is laid waste, and a house divided against a house falls. 
Luk
11:18  “So if Satan also is divided
against himself, how shall his reign stand? Because you say I cast out demons
by Be‛elzebul. 
Luk
11:19  “Now if I cast out demons by Be‛elzebul,
by whom do your sons cast them out? Because of this they shall be your judges. 
Luk
11:20  “But if I cast out demons by the
finger of Elohim, then the reign of Elohim has come upon you. 
Luk
11:21  “When a strong man, having been
well armed, watches over his own court, his possessions are in peace. 
Luk
11:22  “But when a stronger than he comes
upon him and overcomes him, he takes from him all his armour in which he
trusted, and divides his booty. 
Luk
11:23  “He who is not with Me is against
Me, and he who does not gather with Me scatters. 
Luk
11:24  “When the unclean spirit goes out
of a man, he goes through dry places, seeking rest. And finding none, he says, ‘I
shall return to my house from which I came.’ 
Luk
11:25  “And when he comes, he finds it
swept and decorated, 
Luk
11:26  then he goes and takes with him
seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter and dwell there.
And the last state of that man
becomes worse than the first.” 
Luk
11:27  And it came to be, as He was
saying this, a certain woman from the crowd raised her voice and said to Him, “Blessed
is the womb that bore You, and the breasts which You sucked!” 
Luk
11:28  But He said, “Blessed rather are
those hearing the Word of Elohim and watching over it!”
Luk
11:29  And while the crowds were
thronging, He began to say, “This generation is wicked. It seeks a sign, and no
sign shall be given to it except the sign of Yonah the prophet. 
Luk
11:30  “For as Yonah became a sign to the
Ninewites, so also the Son of Aḏam shall be to this generation. 
Luk
11:31  “The sovereigness of the South
shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation and shall condemn
them, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Shelomoh,
and look, a greater than Shelomoh is here. 
Luk
11:32  “The men of Ninewĕh shall
rise up in the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for they repented
at the preaching of Yonah, and look, a greater than Yonah is here. 
Luk
11:33  “And no one, when he has lit a
lamp, puts it in a hidden place or under a basket, but on a lampstand, that
those who come in shall see the light. 
Luk
11:34  “The lamp of the body is the eye.
Therefore, when your eye is good, all your body also is enlightened. But when
your eye is evil, your body also is darkened.
Luk
11:35  “See to it therefore that the
light which is in you is not darkness. 
Luk
11:36  “If then all your body is
enlightened, having no part dark, all shall be enlightened, as when the bright
shining of a lamp gives you light.” 
Luk
11:37  And as He spoke, a certain
Pharisee asked Him to dine with him, so He went in and sat down to eat. 
Luk
11:38  And when the Pharisee saw it, he
marvelled that He did not first wash before dinner. 
Luk
11:39  And the Master said to him, “Now
you Pharisees make the outside of the cup and dish clean, but your inward part
is filled with greed and wickedness. 
Luk
11:40  “Mindless ones! Did not He who
made the outside make the inside also? 
Luk
11:41  “But give in kindness of that
which is within, and see, all are clean to you. 
Luk
11:42  “But woe to you Pharisees, because
you tithe the mint and the rue and every plant, and pass by the right-ruling
and the love of Elohim. These you should have done, without leaving the others
undone. 
Luk
11:43  “Woe to you Pharisees, because you
love the best seats in the congregations and the greetings in the
market-places. 
Luk
11:44  “Woe to you, scribes and
Pharisees, hypocrites, because you are like the unseen tombs, and the men
walking over them do not know.” 
Luk
11:45  And one of those learned in the
Torah, answering, said to Him, “Teacher, when You say this You insult us too.” 
Luk
11:46  And He said, “Woe to you also, you
learned in the Torah, because you load men with burdens hard to bear, and you
yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers.
Luk
11:47  “Woe to you, because you build the
tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.
Luk
11:48  “So you bear witness that you
approve of the works of your fathers, because they indeed killed them, and you
build their tombs. 
Luk
11:49  “And because of this the wisdom of
Elohim said, ‘I shall send them prophets and emissaries, and some of them they
shall kill and persecute,’ 
Luk
11:50  so that the blood of all the
prophets which was shed from the foundation of the world shall be required of
this generation, 
Luk
11:51  from the blood of Heḇel to
the blood of Zeḵaryah who perished between the altar and the Dwelling
Place. Yea, I say to you, it shall be required of this generation. 
Luk
11:52  “Woe to you learned in the Torah,
because you took away the key of knowledge. You did not enter in yourselves,
and those who were entering in you hindered.” 
Luk
11:53  And as He was saying this to them,
the scribes and the Pharisees began to oppose Him fiercely, and to draw Him out
on many subjects, 
Luk
11:54  watching Him, and seeking to catch
Him in whatever He says, so as to accuse Him. 
Luk
12:1  Meanwhile, when an innumerable
crowd of people had gathered together, so that they trampled one another, He
began to say to His taught ones, first, “Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees,
which is hypocrisy. 
Luk
12:2  “And whatever is concealed shall be
revealed, and whatever is hidden shall be known. 
Luk
12:3  “So, whatever you have said in the
dark shall be heard in the light, and what you have spoken in the ear in inner
rooms shall be proclaimed on the house-tops. 
Luk
12:4  “But I say to you, My friends, do
not be afraid of those who kill the body, and after that are unable to do any
more. 
Luk
12:5  “But I shall show you whom you
should fear: Fear the One who, after killing, possesses authority to cast into
Gehenna. Yea, I say to you, fear Him! 
Luk
12:6  “Are not five sparrows sold for two
copper coins? And not one of them is forgotten before Elohim. 
Luk
12:7  “But even the hairs of your head
have all been numbered. Do not fear, you are worth more than many sparrows. 
Luk
12:8  “And I say to you, everyone who
confesses Me before men, the Son of Aḏam shall also confess him before
the messengers of Elohim. 
Luk
12:9  “But he that has denied Me before men
shall be denied before the messengers of Elohim.
