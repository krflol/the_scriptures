Yeshayahu/Isaiah
Isaiah
1:1  The vision of Yeshayahu son of
Amots, which he saw concerning Yehuḏah and Yerushalayim in the days of
Uzziyahu, Yotham, Aḥaz, Ḥizqiyahu – sovereigns of Yehuḏah. 
Isaiah
1:2  Hear, O heavens, and listen, O
earth! For יהוה has spoken, “I have reared and brought
up children, but they have transgressed against Me. 
Isaiah
1:3  An ox knows its owner and a donkey
its master’s crib – Yisra’ĕl does not know, My people have not understood.”

Isaiah
1:4  Alas, sinning nation, a people
loaded with crookedness, a seed of evil-doers, sons acting corruptly! They have
forsaken יהוה, they have provoked the Set-apart One of
Yisra’ĕl, they went backward. 
Isaiah
1:5  Why should you be beaten any more?
You continue in apostasy! All the head is sick, and all the heart faints. 
Isaiah
1:6  From the sole of the foot, to the
head, there is no soundness in it – wounds and bruises and open sores; they
have not been closed or bound up, or soothed with ointment. 
Isaiah
1:7  Your land is laid waste, your cities
are burned with fire, strangers devour your land in your presence. And it is laid
waste, as overthrown by strangers. 
Isaiah
1:8  And the daughter of Tsiyon is left
as a booth in a vineyard, as a hut in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged
city. 
Isaiah
1:9  Unless יהוה
of hosts had left to us a small remnant, we would have become like Seḏom,
we would have been made like Amorah. 
Isaiah
1:10  Hear the word of יהוה,
you rulers of Seḏom; give ear to the Torah of our Elohim, you people of
Amorah! 
Isaiah
1:11  “Of what use to Me are your many
slaughterings?” declares יהוה. “I have had enough of
burnt offerings of rams and the fat of fed beasts. I do not delight in the
blood of bulls, or of lambs or goats. 
Isaiah
1:12  “When you come to appear before Me,
who has required this from your hand, to trample My courtyards? 
Isaiah
1:13  “Stop bringing futile offerings,
incense, it is an abomination to Me. New Moons, Sabbaths, the calling of
meetings – I am unable to bear unrighteousness and assembly. 
Isaiah
1:14  “My being hates your New Moons and
your appointed times, they are a trouble to Me, I am weary of bearing them. 
Isaiah
1:15  “And when you spread out your
hands, I hide My eyes from you; even though you make many prayers, I do not
hear. Your hands have become filled with blood. 
Isaiah
1:16  “Wash yourselves, make yourselves
clean; put away the evil of your doings from before My eyes. Stop doing evil! 
Isaiah
1:17  “Learn to do good! Seek
right-ruling, reprove the oppressor, defend the fatherless, plead for the
widow. 
Isaiah
1:18  “Come now, and let us reason
together,” says יהוה. “Though your sins are like
scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red like crimson, they
shall be as wool. 
Isaiah
1:19  “If you submit and obey, you shall
eat the good of the land; 
Isaiah
1:20  but if you refuse and rebel, you
shall be devoured by the sword,” for the mouth of יהוה
has spoken.
Isaiah
1:21  How the steadfast city has become a
whore! I have filled it with right-ruling; righteousness lodged in it, but now
murderers. 
Isaiah
1:22  Your silver has become dross, your
wine is mixed with water. 
Isaiah
1:23  Your rulers are stubborn, and
companions of thieves. Everyone loves bribes, and runs after rewards. They do
not defend the fatherless, nor does the cause of the widow reach them. 
Isaiah
1:24  Therefore the Master declares, יהוה
of hosts, the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, “Ah, I shall be eased of My adversaries,
and I shall be avenged of My enemies. 
Isaiah
1:25  “And I shall turn My hand against
you, and shall refine your dross as with lye, and shall remove all your alloy. 
Isaiah
1:26  “And I shall give back your judges
as at the first, and your counsellors as at the beginning. After this you shall
be called the city of righteousness, a steadfast city.” 
Isaiah
1:27  Tsiyon shall be redeemed with
right-ruling, and her returning ones with righteousness. 
Isaiah
1:28  And the destruction of
transgressors and of sinners is together, and those who forsake יהוה
shall be consumed. 
Isaiah
1:29  For they shall be ashamed of the
terebinth trees which you have desired. And you shall be embarrassed because of
the gardens which you have chosen. 
Isaiah
1:30  For you shall be as a terebinth
whose leaf fades, and as a garden that has no water. 
Isaiah
1:31  The strong shall be for tow, and
his work for a spark. And both shall burn together, with no one to extinguish. 
Isaiah
2:1  The word that Yeshayahu the son of
Amots saw concerning Yehuḏah and Yerushalayim: 
Isaiah
2:2  And it shall be in the latter days
that the mountain of the House of יהוה is established
on the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills. And all
nations shall flow to it. 
Isaiah
2:3  And many peoples shall come and say,
“Come, and let us go up to the mountain of יהוה, to the
House of the Elohim of Ya‛aqoḇ, and let Him teach us His ways, and
let us walk in His paths, for out of Tsiyon comes forth the Torah, and the Word
of יהוה from Yerushalayim.”
Isaiah
2:4  And He shall judge between the
nations, and shall reprove many peoples. And they shall beat their swords into
ploughshares, and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation shall not lift up
sword against nation, neither teach battle any more. 
Isaiah
2:5  O house of Ya‛aqoḇ, come
and let us walk in the light of יהוה. 
Isaiah
2:6  For You have forsaken Your people,
the house of Ya‛aqoḇ, because they have been filled from the East,
and practise magic like the Philistines, and they are pleased with the children
of foreigners. 
Isaiah
2:7  And their land is filled with silver
and gold, and there is no end to their treasures. And their land is filled with
horses, and there is no end to their chariots. 
Isaiah
2:8  And their land is filled with idols;
they bow themselves to the work of their own hands, to what their own fingers
have made. 
Isaiah
2:9  And the lowly bows down, and the
high is humbled; therefore You do not forgive them. 
Isaiah
2:10  Enter into the rock, and hide in
the dust, because of the fear of יהוה and the splendour
of His excellency. 
Isaiah
2:11  The lofty looks of man shall be
humbled, the pride of men shall be bowed down, and יהוה
alone shall be exalted in that day. 
Isaiah
2:12  For יהוה of
hosts has a day against all that is proud and lofty, against all that is lifted
up, so that it is brought low; 
Isaiah
2:13  and against all the cedars of Leḇanon
that are high and lifted up, and against all the oaks of Bashan; 
Isaiah
2:14  and against all the high mountains,
and against all the hills that are lifted up; 
Isaiah
2:15  and against every lofty tower, and
against every strong wall; 
Isaiah
2:16  and against all the ships of
Tarshish, and against all the desirable craft. 
Isaiah
2:17  And the loftiness of man shall be
bowed down, and the pride of men shall be brought low. And יהוה
alone shall be exalted in that day, 
Isaiah
2:18  and the idols completely pass away.

Isaiah
2:19  And they shall go into the holes of
the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, from dread of יהוה
and the splendour of His excellency, when He arises to shake the earth
mightily. 
Isaiah
2:20  In that day man shall throw away
his idols of silver and his idols of gold, which they made, each for himself to
worship, to the moles and bats, 
Isaiah
2:21  to go into the clefts of the rocks,
and into the crags of the rugged rocks, because of the fear of יהוה
and the splendour of His excellency, when He arises to shake the earth
mightily. 
Isaiah
2:22  Cease from man, whose breath is in
his nostrils, for in what is he to be reckoned upon? 
Isaiah
3:1  For look, the Master, יהוה
of hosts, is turning aside from Yerushalayim and from Yehuḏah the stock
and the store, all the supply of bread and all the supply of water; 
Isaiah
3:2  the mighty man and the man of
battle, the judge and the prophet, and the diviner and the elder; 
Isaiah
3:3  the commander of fifty and the
highly respected man, and the counsellor and the skilled craftsman, and the clever
enchanter. 
Isaiah
3:4  “And I shall make youths their
heads, and children shall rule over them. 
Isaiah
3:5  And the people shall exert pressure,
man on man, man on his neighbour; the young rise up against the older, and the
lightly esteemed against the highly esteemed.” 
Isaiah
3:6  When a man takes hold of his brother
in the house of his father, by the garment, and
say, “Come, be a chief over us, and let this ruin be under your hand,” 
Isaiah
3:7  he shall swear in that day, saying, “I
am not a healer, for in my house is neither bread nor garment; do not make me a
chief of the people.” 
Isaiah
3:8  For Yerushalayim has stumbled, and
Yehuḏah has fallen, because their tongue and their doings are against יהוה,
to provoke the eyes of His esteem. 
Isaiah
3:9  The look on their faces witnesses
against them, and they declare their sin as Seḏom; they do not hide it.
Woe to their being! For they have brought evil upon themselves. 
Isaiah
3:10  “Say to the righteous it is well,
for they eat the fruit of their doings. 
Isaiah
3:11  “Woe to the wrong – evil! For the
reward of his hand is done to him. 
Isaiah
3:12  “My people! Youths exert pressure
on them, and women rule over them. O My people! Your leaders lead you astray, and swallow the way of your
paths.”
Isaiah
3:13  יהוה shall
stand up to plead, and is standing to judge the peoples. 
Isaiah
3:14  יהוה enters
into judgment with the elders of His people and its heads, “It is you who have
eaten up the vineyard, the plunder of the poor is in your houses. 
Isaiah
3:15  “What do you mean by crushing My
people and grinding the faces of the poor?” declares the Master, יהוה
of hosts. 
Isaiah
3:16  And יהוה
says, “Because the daughters of Tsiyon are haughty, and walk with outstretched
necks and seductive eyes, walking and mincing as they go, making a jingling
with their feet, 
Isaiah
3:17  therefore יהוה
shall smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Tsiyon, and יהוה
expose their nakedness.” 
Isaiah
3:18  In that day יהוה
takes away the finery of the anklets, and the headbands, and the crescents, 
Isaiah
3:19  the pendants, the bracelets and the
veils, 
Isaiah
3:20  the headdresses, and the leg
ornaments, and the sashes, and the perfume bottles, and the amulets, 
Isaiah
3:21  the rings, and the nose jewels, 
Isaiah
3:22  the costly robes, and the cloaks,
and the shawls, and the purses, 
Isaiah
3:23  the mirrors, and the fine linen,
and the turbans, and the large veils. 
Isaiah
3:24  And it shall be: Instead of a sweet
fragrance, a smell of decay; and instead of a belt, a rope; and instead of
well-set hair, baldness; and instead of a festal robe, a girding of sackcloth;
and branding instead of loveliness. 
Isaiah
3:25  Your men shall fall by the sword,
and your strength in battle. 
Isaiah
3:26  And her gates shall lament and
mourn, and she, deserted, shall sit on the ground. 
Isaiah
4:1  And in that day seven women shall
take hold of one man, saying, “We shall eat our own food and wear our own
clothes; only let us be called by your name, to take away our reproach.” 
Isaiah
4:2  In that day the Branch of יהוה
shall be splendid and esteemed. And the fruit of the earth shall be excellent
and comely for the escaped ones of Yisra’ĕl.
Isaiah
4:3  And it shall be that he who is left
in Tsiyon and he who remains in Yerushalayim is called set-apart, everyone who
is written among the living in Yerushalayim. 
Isaiah
4:4  When יהוה
has washed away the filth of the daughters of Tsiyon, and rinsed away the blood
of Yerushalayim from her midst, by the spirit of judgment and by the spirit of
burning, 
Isaiah
4:5  then יהוה
shall create above every dwelling place of Mount Tsiyon, and above her
assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day and the shining of a flaming fire by
night, for over all the esteem shall be a covering, 
Isaiah
4:6  and a booth for shade in the daytime
from the heat, for a place of refuge, and for a shelter from storm and rain. 
Isaiah
5:1  Please let me sing to the One I
love, a song for my loved One regarding His vineyard: my loved One has a
vineyard on a fertile hill. 
Isaiah
5:2  And He dug it up and cleared it of
stones, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a watchtower in its
midst, and also made a winepress in it. And He waited for the yielding of
grapes, but it yielded rotten ones. 
Isaiah
5:3  “And now, O inhabitant of
Yerushalayim and man of Yehuḏah, please judge between Me and My vineyard.

Isaiah
5:4  “What more could have been done to
My vineyard that I have not done in it? Why, when I waited for the yielding of
grapes, did it yield rotten ones? 
Isaiah
5:5  “And now, please let Me inform you
what I am doing to My vineyard: To take away its hedge and it shall be burned;
to break down its wall and it shall be trampled down; 
Isaiah
5:6  and I lay it waste; it is not pruned
or dug and thornbushes and weeds shall come up; and I command the clouds not to
rain on it.” 
Isaiah
5:7  For the vineyard of יהוה
of hosts is the house of Yisra’ĕl, and the man of Yehuḏah is His
pleasant plant. He looked for right-ruling, but see, oppression; for
righteousness, but see, weeping. 
Isaiah
5:8  Woe to those who join house to
house, who add field to field, until there is no room, and you are made to
dwell alone in the midst of the land! 
Isaiah
5:9  In my hearing יהוה
of hosts said, “Truly, many houses
shall be a waste – big and fine ones, without inhabitant. 
Isaiah
5:10  “For ten acres of vineyard yield
one bath, and a ḥomer of seed yields one ĕphah.” 
Isaiah
5:11  Woe to those who rise early in the
morning pursuing strong drink, who stay up late at night – wine inflames them! 
Isaiah
5:12  And the lyre and the harp, the
tambourine and flute, and wine are in their feasts; but they do not regard the
deeds of יהוה, nor see the work of His hands. 
Isaiah
5:13  Therefore my people have gone into
exile, because they have no knowledge. And their esteemed men are starved, and
their crowd dried up with thirst. 
Isaiah
5:14  Therefore the grave has made itself
wide and opened its mouth beyond measure. Their splendour and their crowd and
their uproar, and he who is exulting within her, shall go down into it. 
Isaiah
5:15  And man is bowed down, and mortal
man humbled, and the eyes of the proud are humbled. 
Isaiah
5:16  But יהוה of
hosts is exalted in judgment, and the set-apart Ĕl is set-apart in
righteousness. 
Isaiah
5:17  And the lambs shall feed in their
pasture, and strangers shall eat in the waste places of the fat ones. 
Isaiah
5:18  Woe to those who draw crookedness
with cords of falsehood, and sin as with wagon ropes, 
Isaiah
5:19  who are saying, “Let Him hurry! Let
Him hasten His work, so that we see it! And let the counsel of the Set-apart
One of Yisra’ĕl draw near and come, so that we know.” 
Isaiah
5:20  Woe to those who call evil good,
and good evil; who put darkness for light, and light for darkness; who put
bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter! 
Isaiah
5:21  Woe to those who are wise in their
own eyes, and clever in their own sight!
Isaiah
5:22  Woe to the mighty to drink wine,
and brave men to mix strong drink, 
Isaiah
5:23  who declare right the wrong for a
bribe, and the righteousness of the righteous they turn aside from him! 
Isaiah
5:24  Therefore, as a tongue of fire
devours the stubble, and the flame consumes the chaff, their root is as rottenness,
and their blossom goes up like dust – because they have rejected the Torah of יהוה
of hosts, and despised the Word of the Set-apart One of Yisra’ĕl.
Isaiah
5:25  Therefore the displeasure of יהוה
has burned against His people, and He stretches out His hand against them and
smites them, and the mountains tremble. And their carcass is as filth in the
middle of the streets. With all this His displeasure has not turned back, and
His hand is still stretched out!
Isaiah
5:26  And He shall lift up a banner to
the nations from afar, and shall whistle to them from the end of the earth. And
see, they come with speed, swiftly! 
Isaiah
5:27  Not one of them is weary or
stumbling, not one slumbers or sleeps. Not a belt shall be loosened on their
loins, nor the thong of their sandals be broken. 
Isaiah
5:28  Their arrows are sharp, and all
their bows bent; their horses’ hooves shall seem like flint, and their wheels
like a whirlwind. 
Isaiah
5:29  Their roar is like that of a lion,
they roar like young lions. And they growl and seize prey, and slip away, with
no one to rescue. 
Isaiah
5:30  And in that day they shall growl
over it as with the growling of the sea. And one shall look at the earth, and
see, darkness and distress! And light shall be darkened by the clouds. 
Isaiah
6:1  In the year that Sovereign Uzziyahu
died, I saw יהוה sitting on a throne, high and lifted
up, and the train of His robe filled the Hĕḵal. 
Isaiah
6:2  Above it stood seraphim. Each one
had six wings: with two he covered his face, with two he covered his feet, and
with two he flew. 
Isaiah
6:3  And one cried to another and said, “Set-apart,
set-apart, set-apart is יהוה of hosts; all the earth is
filled with His esteem!” 
Isaiah
6:4  And the posts of the door were
shaken by the voice of him who cried out, and the house was filled with smoke.
Isaiah
6:5  And I said, “Woe to me, for I am
undone! Because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a
people of unclean lips – for my eyes have seen the Sovereign, יהוה
of hosts.” 
Isaiah
6:6  And one of the seraphim flew to me,
having in his hand a live coal which he had taken with the tongs from the
altar. 
Isaiah
6:7  And he touched my mouth with it, and
said, “See, this has touched your lips; your crookedness is taken away, and
your sin is covered.” 
Isaiah
6:8  And I heard the voice of יהוה,
saying, “Whom do I send, and who would go for Us?” And I said, “Here am I! Send
me.” 
Isaiah
6:9  And He said, “Go, and you shall say
to this people, ‘Hearing, you hear, but do not understand; and seeing, you see,
but do not know.’ 
Isaiah
6:10  “Make the heart of this people fat,
and their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and
hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and shall turn and be
healed.” 
Isaiah
6:11  Then I said, “ יהוה,
until when?” And He answered, “Until the cities are laid waste and without
inhabitant, and the houses are without a man, and the land is laid waste, a
ruin, 
Isaiah
6:12  and יהוה
has removed men far away, and the forsaken places be many in the midst of the
land. 
Isaiah
6:13  “But still, there is a tenth part
in it, and it shall again be for a burning, like a terebinth tree and like an
oak, whose stump remains when it is cut down. The set-apart seed is its stump!”

Isaiah
7:1  And it came to be in the days of
Aḥaz son of Yotham, son of Uzziyahu, sovereign of Yehuḏah, that
Retsin sovereign of Aram and Peqaḥ son of Remalyahu, sovereign of Yisra’ĕl,
went up to Yerushalayim to fight against it, but could not prevail against it. 
Isaiah
7:2  And it was reported to the house of
Dawiḏ, saying, “Aram has set up camp in Ephrayim.” And his heart and the
heart of his people were moved as the trees of the forest are moved with the
wind. 
Isaiah
7:3  And יהוה
said to Yeshayahu, “Go out now to meet Aḥaz, you and She’ar-Yashuḇ
your son, at the end of the channel of the upper pool, on the highway of the
Launderer’s Field, 
Isaiah
7:4  and say to him, ‘Take heed, and be
calm; do not fear or be faint-hearted for these two stubs of smoking
firebrands, for the fierce displeasure of Retsin and Aram, and the son of
Remalyahu. 
Isaiah
7:5  ‘Because Aram, Ephrayim, and the son
of Remalyahu have plotted evil against you, saying, 
Isaiah
7:6  “Let us go up against Yehuḏah
and tear it apart, and break it open for ourselves, and set a sovereign over
them, the son of Taḇe’ĕl.” 
Isaiah
7:7  ‘Thus said the Master יהוה,
“It is not going to stand, nor shall it take place. 
Isaiah
7:8  “For the head of Aram is Damascus,
and the head of Damascus is Retsin. And within sixty-five years Ephrayim is to
be broken as a people. 
Isaiah
7:9  “And the head of Ephrayim is
Shomeron, and the head of Shomeron is the son of Remalyahu. If you do not
believe, you are not steadfast.” ’ ” 
Isaiah
7:10  And יהוה
spoke again to Aḥaz, saying, 
Isaiah
7:11  “Ask a sign for yourself from יהוה
your Elohim; make deep the request or make it high.” 
Isaiah
7:12  But Aḥaz said, “I do not ask
nor try יהוה !” 
Isaiah
7:13  And he said, “Hear now, O house of
Dawiḏ! Is it not enough that you weary men, that you weary my Elohim
also? 
Isaiah
7:14  “Therefore יהוה
Himself gives you a sign: Look, the maiden conceives and gives birth to a Son,
and shall call His Name Immanu’ĕl.
Isaiah
7:15  “He eats curds and honey when He
knows to refuse evil and choose the good. 
Isaiah
7:16  “For before the Child knows to
refuse evil and choose the good, the land that you dread is to be forsaken by
both her sovereigns.
Isaiah
7:17  “ יהוה
brings on you and your people and your father’s house days that have not come
since the day that Ephrayim turned away from Yehuḏah – the sovereign of
Ashshur.” 
Isaiah
7:18  And it shall be in that day that יהוה
whistles for the fly that is in the farthest part of the rivers of Mitsrayim,
and for the bee that is in the land of Ashshur. 
Isaiah
7:19  And they shall come, and all of
them shall rest in the steep ravines and in the clefts of the rocks, and on all
weeds and in all pastures. 
Isaiah
7:20  In that day יהוה
shall shave with a razor hired beyond the River – with the sovereign of Ashshur
– the head and the hair of the legs, and also remove the beard. 
Isaiah
7:21  And it shall be in that day that a
man keeps alive a young cow and two sheep. 
Isaiah
7:22  And it shall be, that he shall eat
curds because of the plenty milk he gets, for everyone left in the land shall
eat curds. 
Isaiah
7:23  And it shall be in that day, every
place where there were a thousand vines worth a thousand sheqels of silver, let
it be for thornbushes and weeds. 
Isaiah
7:24  With arrows and bows one shall go
there, because all the land shall be thornbushes and weeds. 
Isaiah
7:25  And to all the hills which were
tilled with the hoe, you do not go for fear of thornbushes and weeds; but it
shall be for sending oxen to, and a place for sheep to roam. 
Isaiah
8:1  And יהוה
said to me, “Take a large tablet, and write on it with a man’s pen concerning
Mahĕr-Shalal-Ḥash-Baz. 
Isaiah
8:2  “And let Me take reliable witnesses
to record, Uriyah the priest and Zeḵaryahu son of Yeḇereḵyahu.”

Isaiah
8:3  And I went to the prophetess, and
she conceived and bore a son. And יהוה said to me, “Call
his name Mahĕr-Shalal-Ḥash-Baz; 
Isaiah
8:4  for before the child knows to cry ‘My
father’ and ‘My mother,’ the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Shomeron is
taken away before the sovereign of Ashshur.” 
Isaiah
8:5  And יהוה
spoke to me again, saying, 
Isaiah
8:6  “Inasmuch as these people refused
the waters of Shiloaḥ that flow softly, and rejoice in Retsin and in
Remalyahu’s son; 
Isaiah
8:7  now therefore, see, יהוה
brings up over them the waters of the River, strong and mighty – the sovereign
of Ashshur and all his esteem. And he shall come up over all his channels and
go over all his banks. 
Isaiah
8:8  “And he shall pass through Yehuḏah,
he shall overflow and pass over, reaching up to the neck. And the stretching
out of his wings shall fill the breadth of Your land, O Immanu’ĕl. 
Isaiah
8:9  “Be shattered, O you peoples, and be
broken in pieces! Give ear, all you from the far places of the earth. Gird
yourselves, but be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, but be broken in pieces. 
Isaiah
8:10  “Take counsel, and it comes to
naught; speak a word, and it does not stand, for Ĕl is with us.” 
Isaiah
8:11  For יהוה
spoke thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me that I should not walk
in the way of this people, saying, 
Isaiah
8:12  “Do not say, ‘A conspiracy,’
concerning all that this people call a conspiracy, nor be afraid of their
threats, nor be troubled. 
Isaiah
8:13  “ יהוה of
hosts, Him you shall set apart. Let Him be your fear, and let Him be your
dread. 
Isaiah
8:14  “And He shall be for a set-apart
place, but a stone of stumbling and a rock that makes for falling to both the
houses of Yisra’ĕl, as a trap and a snare to the inhabitants of
Yerushalayim. 
Isaiah
8:15  “And many among them shall stumble
and fall, and be broken and snared and taken.” 
Isaiah
8:16  Bind up the witness, seal the Torah
among my taught ones. 
Isaiah
8:17  And I shall wait on יהוה,
who hides His face from the house of Ya‛aqoḇ. And I shall look for
Him. 
Isaiah
8:18  Look, I and the children whom יהוה
has given me – for signs and wonders in Yisra’ĕl from יהוה
of hosts, who dwells in Mount Tsiyon. 
Isaiah
8:19  And when they say to you, “Seek
those who are mediums and wizards, who whisper and mutter,” should not a people
seek their Elohim? Should they seek the dead on behalf of the living? 
Isaiah
8:20  To the Torah and to the witness! If
they do not speak according to this Word, it is because they have no daybreak.
Isaiah
8:21  And they shall pass through it hard
pressed and hungry. And it shall be, when they are hungry, that they shall be
wroth and curse their sovereign and their Elohim, looking upward. 
Isaiah
8:22  And they shall look to the earth
and see distress and darkness, gloom of hard times, and be driven into thick
darkness. 
Isaiah
9:1  But there is no gloom upon her who
is distressed, as when at first He humbled the land of Zeḇulun and the
land of Naphtali, and afterward more heavily oppressed her, by the way of the
sea, beyond the Yardĕn, in Galil of the nations. 
Isaiah
9:2  The people who were walking in
darkness have seen a great light; upon those who dwelt in the land of the
shadow of death a light has shone. 
Isaiah
9:3  You shall increase the nation; You
shall make its joy great. They shall rejoice before You, as in the joy of
harvest, as men rejoice when they divide the spoil. 
Isaiah
9:4  For You shall break the yoke of his
burden and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, as in the day
of Miḏyan. 
Isaiah
9:5  For every boot of one trampling in
tumult, and coat rolled in blood, shall be used for burning and fuel of fire. 
Isaiah
9:6  For a Child shall be born unto us, a
Son shall be given unto us, and the rule is on His shoulder. And His Name is
called Wonder, Counsellor, Strong Ĕl, Father of Continuity, Prince of
Peace. 
Isaiah
9:7  Of the increase of His rule and
peace there is no end, upon the throne of Dawiḏ and over His reign, to
establish it and sustain it with right-ruling and with righteousness from now
on, even forever. The ardour of יהוה of hosts does
this.
Isaiah
9:8  יהוה sent a
word against Ya‛aqoḇ, and it has fallen on Yisra’ĕl. 
Isaiah
9:9  And the people shall know, all of
them, Ephrayim and the inhabitant of Shomeron, who say in pride and greatness
of heart: 
Isaiah
9:10  “The bricks have fallen down, but
we rebuild with hewn stones; the sycamores are cut down, but we replace them
with cedars.” 
Isaiah
9:11  And יהוה
set up the adversaries of Retsin against him, and stirred up his enemies, 
Isaiah
9:12  the Arameans before and the
Philistines behind. And they devour Yisra’ĕl with an open mouth. With all
this His displeasure has not turned back, and His hand is still stretched out. 
Isaiah
9:13  And the people have not turned back
to Him who smites them, nor have they sought יהוה of
hosts. 
Isaiah
9:14  And יהוה
cuts off head and tail from Yisra’ĕl, palm branch and reed in one day. 
Isaiah
9:15  Elder and highly respected, he is
the head; the prophet who teaches falsehood, he is the tail. 
Isaiah
9:16  For the leaders of this people lead
them astray, and those who are guided
by them are swallowed up.
Isaiah
9:17  Therefore יהוה
does not rejoice over their young men, and has no compassion on their
fatherless and widows; for everyone is defiled and evil, and every mouth speaks
foolishness. With all this His displeasure has not turned back, and His hand is
still stretched out. 
Isaiah
9:18  For wrongness burns as the fire; it
consumes thornbushes and weeds, and sets the bushes of the forest ablaze, and
they roll up like rising smoke. 
Isaiah
9:19  The land shall be burned up by the
wrath of יהוה of hosts, and the people be as fuel for
the fire. A man shall not spare his brother, 
Isaiah
9:20  and cut down on the right hand, but
shall be hungry; and he devours on the left hand, but shall not be satisfied;
each one devouring the flesh of his own arm: 
Isaiah
9:21  Menashsheh Ephrayim, and Ephrayim
Menashsheh; together they are against Yehuḏah. With all this His
displeasure has not turned back, and His hand is still stretched out. 
Isaiah
10:1  “Woe to those making unrighteous
laws, and writers who have prescribed toil, 
Isaiah
10:2  to keep the needy back from
right-ruling, and to take what is right from the poor of My people, that widows
become their prey, and orphans their plunder. 
Isaiah
10:3  “What shall you do in the day of
visitation, and in the ruin which comes from afar? To whom would you run for
help? And where would you leave your wealth? 
Isaiah
10:4  “Without Me they shall bow down
among the prisoners, and fall among the slain.” With all this His displeasure
has not turned back, and His hand is still stretched out. 
Isaiah
10:5  “Woe to Ashshur, the rod of My
displeasure and the staff in whose hand is My displeasure. 
Isaiah
10:6  “Against a defiled nation I send
him, and against the people of My wrath I command him to seize the spoil, to
take the prey, and to tread them down like the mud of the streets. 
Isaiah
10:7  “But he does not intend so, nor
does his heart think so, for it is in his heart to destroy, and cut off not a
few nations. 
Isaiah
10:8  “For he says, ‘Are not my princes
sovereigns? 
Isaiah
10:9  ‘Is not Kalno like Karkemish? Is
not Ḥamath like Arpaḏ? Is not Shomeron like Damascus? 
Isaiah
10:10  ‘As my hand has found the reigns
of the idols, whose carved images excelled those of Yerushalayim and Shomeron, 
Isaiah
10:11  as I have done to Shomeron and her
idols, do I not do also to Yerushalayim and her idols?’ 
Isaiah
10:12  “And it shall be, when יהוה
has performed all His work on Mount Tsiyon and on Yerushalayim, that I shall
punish the fruit of the greatness of the heart of the sovereign of Ashshur, and
the boasting of his haughty looks. 
Isaiah
10:13  “For he has said, ‘By the power of
my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom, for I have been clever. And I remove
the boundaries of the people, and have robbed their treasuries. And I put down
the inhabitants like a strong one. 
Isaiah
10:14  ‘And my hand finds the riches of
the people like a nest. And I have gathered all the earth like forsaken eggs
are gathered. And there was no one who moved his wing, nor opened his mouth
with even a peep.’ ” 
Isaiah
10:15  Would the axe boast itself over
him who chops with it, or the saw exalt itself over him who saws with it? As a
rod waving those who lift it up! As a staff lifting up that which is not wood! 
Isaiah
10:16  Therefore the Master, יהוה
of hosts, sends leanness among his fat ones. And under his esteem he kindles a
burning like the burning of a fire. 
Isaiah
10:17  And the Light of Yisra’ĕl
shall be for a fire, and his Set-apart One for a flame. And it shall burn and
devour his weeds and his thornbushes in one day, 
Isaiah
10:18  and consume the esteem of his
forest and of his fertile field, both life and flesh. And they shall be as when
a sick man wastes away, 
Isaiah
10:19  and the remaining trees of his
forest shall be so few in number that a child records them. 
Isaiah
10:20  And in that day it shall be that
the remnant of Yisra’ĕl, and those who have escaped of the house of Ya‛aqoḇ,
never again lean upon him who defeated them, but shall lean upon יהוה,
the Set-apart One of Yisra’ĕl, in truth. 
Isaiah
10:21  A remnant shall return, the
remnant of Ya‛aqoḇ, to the Mighty Ĕl. 
Isaiah
10:22  For though your people, O Yisra’ĕl,
be as the sand of the sea, yet a remnant of them shall return – a decisive end,
overflowing with righteousness. 
Isaiah
10:23  For the Master יהוה
of hosts is making a complete end, as decided, in the midst of all the earth. 
Isaiah
10:24  Therefore thus said the Master יהוה
of hosts, “My people, who dwell in Tsiyon, be not afraid of Ashshur, who beats
you with a rod and lifts up his staff against you, in the way of Mitsrayim. 
Isaiah
10:25  “For yet a little while and the
displeasure shall be completed, and My displeasure be to their destruction.” 
Isaiah
10:26  And יהוה
of hosts stirs up a lash for him as the smiting of Miḏyan at the rock of
Orĕḇ. And as His rod was on the sea, so shall He lift it up in the
way of Mitsrayim. 
Isaiah
10:27  And in that day it shall be that
his burden is removed from your shoulder, and his yoke from your neck, and the
yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing oil. 
Isaiah
10:28  He has come upon Ayath, he has
passed Miḡron. At Miḵmash he stored his supplies. 
Isaiah
10:29  They have gone through the pass,
they have taken up lodging at Geḇa. Ramah is afraid, Giḇ‛ah
of Sha’ul has fled. 
Isaiah
10:30  Lift up your voice, O daughter of
Galliym! Listen, Layishah – O poor Anathoth! 
Isaiah
10:31  Maḏmĕnah has fled, the
inhabitants of Gĕḇim sought refuge. 
Isaiah
10:32  Yet he remains at Noḇ that
day; he shakes his fist at the mountain of the daughter of Tsiyon, the hill of
Yerushalayim. 
Isaiah
10:33  Look, the Master, יהוה
of hosts, is lopping off a branch with an awesome crash, and the tall ones are
cut down, and the lofty ones are laid low. 
Isaiah
10:34  And He shall cut down the thickets
of the forest with iron, and Leḇanon shall fall as a mighty one! 
Isaiah
11:1  And a Rod shall come forth from the
stump of Yishai, and a Sprout from his roots shall bear fruit. 
Isaiah
11:2  The Spirit of יהוה
shall rest upon Him – the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, the Spirit of
counsel and might, the Spirit of knowledge and of the fear of יהוה,

Isaiah
11:3  and shall make Him breathe in the
fear of יהוה. And He shall not judge by the sight of
His eyes, nor decide by the hearing of His ears. 
Isaiah
11:4  But with righteousness He shall
judge the poor, and shall decide with straightness for the meek ones of the
earth, and shall smite the earth with the rod of His mouth, and slay the wrong
with the breath of His lips. 
Isaiah
11:5  And righteousness shall be the girdle
of His loins, and trustworthiness the girdle of His waist. 
Isaiah
11:6  And a wolf shall dwell with the
lamb, and a leopard lie down with the young goat, and the calf and the young
lion and the fatling together, and a little child leads them. 
Isaiah
11:7  And cow and bear shall feed, their
young ones lie down together, and a lion eat straw like an ox. 
Isaiah
11:8  And the nursing child shall play by
the cobra’s hole, and the weaned child shall put his hand in the adder’s den. 
Isaiah
11:9  They do no evil nor destroy in all
My set-apart mountain, for the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of יהוה
as the waters cover the sea.
Isaiah
11:10  And in that day there shall be a
Root of Yishai, standing as a banner to the people. Unto Him the gentiles shall
seek, and His rest shall be esteem.
Isaiah
11:11  And it shall be in that day that יהוה
sets His hand again a second time to recover the remnant of His people who are
left, from Ashshur and from Mitsrayim, from Pathros and from Kush, from Ĕylam
and from Shin‛ar, from Ḥamath and from the islands of the sea. 
Isaiah
11:12  And He shall raise a banner for
the nations, and gather the outcasts of Yisra’ĕl, and assemble the
dispersed of Yehuḏah from the four corners of the earth. 
Isaiah
11:13  And the envy of Ephrayim shall
turn aside, and the adversaries of Yehuḏah be cut off. Ephrayim shall not
envy Yehuḏah, and Yehuḏah not trouble Ephrayim. 
Isaiah
11:14  But they shall fly down upon the
shoulder of the Philistines toward the west; together they plunder the people
of the east, their hand stretching forth on Eḏom and Mo’aḇ, and the
children of Ammon shall be subject to them. 
Isaiah
11:15  And יהוה
shall put under the ban the tongue of the Sea of Mitsrayim, and He shall wave
His hand over the River with the might of His Spirit, and shall smite it in the
seven streams, and shall cause men to
tread it in sandals. 
Isaiah
11:16  And there shall be a highway for
the remnant of His people, those left from Ashshur, as it was for Yisra’ĕl
in the day when he came up from the land of Mitsrayim. 
Isaiah
12:1  And in that day you shall say, “I
thank You יהוה, though You were enraged with me, Your
displeasure has turned back, and You have comforted me. 
Isaiah
12:2  “See, Ĕl is my deliverance, I
trust and am not afraid. For Yah, יהוה, is my strength
and my song; and He has become my deliverance.”
Isaiah
12:3  And you shall draw water with joy
from the fountains of deliverance. 
Isaiah
12:4  And in that day you shall say, “Praise
יהוה, call upon His Name; make known His deeds among
the peoples, make mention that His Name is exalted. 
Isaiah
12:5  “Sing to יהוה,
For He has done excellently; this is known in all the earth. 
Isaiah
12:6  “Cry aloud and shout, O inhabitant
of Tsiyon, for great is the Set-apart One of Yisra’ĕl in your midst!”
Isaiah
13:1  The message concerning Baḇel
which Yeshayahu son of Amots saw. 
Isaiah
13:2  “Lift up a banner on the high
mountain, raise your voice to them; wave your hand, let them enter the gates of
the nobles. 
Isaiah
13:3  “I have commanded My set-apart
ones; I have also called My mighty men for My displeasure, My proudly exulting
ones.” 
Isaiah
13:4  The noise of an uproar in the
mountains, like that of many people! A noise of uproar of the reigns of
gentiles gathered together! יהוה of hosts is gathering
an army for battle. 
Isaiah
13:5  They are coming from a distant
land, from the end of the heavens, even יהוה and His
weapons of displeasure, to destroy all the earth. 
Isaiah
13:6  Howl, for the day of יהוה
is near! It comes as a destruction from the Almighty. 
Isaiah
13:7  Therefore all hands go limp, every
man’s heart melts, 
Isaiah
13:8  and they shall be afraid. Pangs and
sorrows take hold of them, they are in pain as a woman in labour; they are
amazed at one another, their faces aflame! 
Isaiah
13:9  See, the day of יהוה
is coming, fierce, with wrath and heat of displeasure, to lay the earth waste,
and destroy its sinners from it. 
Isaiah
13:10  For the stars of the heavens and
their constellations do not give off their light. The sun shall be dark at its
rising, and the moon not send out its light. 
Isaiah
13:11  “And I shall punish the world for
its evil, and the wrong for their crookedness, and shall put an end to the
arrogance of the proud, and lay low the pride of the ruthless.
Isaiah
13:12  “I shall make mortal man scarcer than fine gold, and mankind
scarcer than the gold of Ophir. 
Isaiah
13:13  “So I shall make the heavens
tremble, and the earth shall shake from her place, in the wrath of יהוה
of hosts and in the day of the heat of His displeasure. 
Isaiah
13:14  “And it shall be as the hunted
gazelle, and as a sheep that no man takes up – every man turns to his own
people, and everyone flees to his own land. 
Isaiah
13:15  “Whoever is found is thrust
through, and everyone taken falls by the sword. 
Isaiah
13:16  “And their children are dashed to
pieces before their eyes, their houses plundered and their wives ravished. 
Isaiah
13:17  “See, I am stirring up the Medes
against them, who do not regard silver, and as for gold, they do not delight in
it. 
Isaiah
13:18  “And bows dash the young to
pieces, and they have no compassion on the fruit of the womb, their eye spare
no children. 
Isaiah
13:19  “And Baḇel, the splendour of
reigns, the comeliness of the Chaldeans’ pride, shall be as when Elohim
overthrew Seḏom and Amorah. 
Isaiah
13:20  “She shall never be inhabited, nor
be settled from generation to generation; nor shall the Araḇian pitch
tents there, nor shepherds rest their flocks there. 
Isaiah
13:21  “But wild beasts of the desert
shall lie there, and their houses shall be filled with owls. And ostriches
shall dwell there, and wild goats frolic there. 
Isaiah
13:22  “And hyenas shall cry in their
citadels, and jackals in their pleasant palaces. And her time is near to come,
and her days are not drawn out.” 
Isaiah
14:1  Because יהוה
has compassion on Ya‛aqoḇ, and shall again choose Yisra’ĕl,
and give them rest in their own land. And the strangers shall join them, and
they shall cling to the house of Ya‛aqoḇ.
Isaiah
14:2  And peoples shall take them and
bring them to their own place. And the house of Yisra’ĕl shall possess
them for servants and female servants in the land of יהוה.
And they shall make captives of their captors, and rule over their oppressors. 
Isaiah
14:3  And it shall be, in the day יהוה
gives you rest from your sorrow, and from your trouble and the hard service in
which you were made to serve, 
Isaiah
14:4  that you shall take up this proverb
against the sovereign of Baḇel, and say, “How the oppressor has ceased,
the gold-gatherer ceased! 
Isaiah
14:5  “ יהוה has
broken the staff of the wrong, the sceptre of the rulers, 
Isaiah
14:6  he who smote the people in wrath
with ceaseless blows, he who ruled the gentiles in displeasure, is persecuted
and no one restrains. 
Isaiah
14:7  “All the earth is at rest and at
peace, they shall break forth into singing. 
Isaiah
14:8  “Even the cypress trees rejoice
over you, and the cedars of Leḇanon, saying, ‘Since you were cut down, no
woodcutter has come up against us.’ 
Isaiah
14:9  “The grave from beneath is excited
about you, to meet you at your coming; it stirs up the dead for you, all the
chief ones of the earth; it has raised up from their thrones all the sovereigns
of the gentiles. 
Isaiah
14:10  “All of them respond and say to
you, ‘Have you also become as weak as we? Have you become like us? 
Isaiah
14:11  ‘Your arrogance has been brought
down to the grave, and the sound of your stringed instruments; the maggot is
spread under you, and worms cover you.’ 
Isaiah
14:12  “How you have fallen from the
heavens, O Hĕlĕl, son of the morning! You have been cut down to the
ground, you who laid low the gentiles! 
Isaiah
14:13  “For you have said in your heart, ‘Let
me go up to the heavens, let me raise my throne above the stars of Ĕl, and
let me sit in the mount of meeting on the sides of the north; 
Isaiah
14:14  let me go up above the heights of
the clouds, let me be like the Most High.’ 
Isaiah
14:15  “But you are brought down to the
grave, to the sides of the Pit. 
Isaiah
14:16  “Those who see you stare at you,
and ponder over you, saying, ‘Is this the man who made the earth tremble, who
shook reigns, 
Isaiah
14:17  who made the world as a wilderness
and destroyed its cities, who would not open the house of his prisoners?’ 
Isaiah
14:18  “All the sovereigns of the
gentiles, all of them, were laid in esteem, everyone in his own house; 
Isaiah
14:19  but you have been thrown from your
grave like an abominable branch, like the garment of those who are slain, thrust
through with a sword, who go down to the stones of the pit, like a trampled
corpse.
Isaiah
14:20  “You are not joined with them in
burial, for you have destroyed your land and slain your people. Let the seed of
evil-doers never be mentioned. 
Isaiah
14:21  “Prepare his children for
slaughter, because of the crookedness of their fathers, lest they rise up and
possess the land, and fill the face of the world with cities.” 
Isaiah
14:22  “And I shall rise up against them,”
declares יהוה of hosts, “and shall cut off from Baḇel
the name and remnant, and offspring and descendant,” declares יהוה.

Isaiah
14:23  “And I shall make it a possession
for the porcupine, and marshes of muddy water; and shall sweep it with the
broom of destruction,” declares יהוה of hosts. 
Isaiah
14:24  יהוה of
hosts has sworn, saying, “Truly, as I have planned, so shall it be; and as I
have purposed, so it stands:
Isaiah
14:25  “To break Ashshur in My land, and
tread him down on My mountains. And his yoke shall be removed from them, and
his burden removed from their shoulders. 
Isaiah
14:26  “This is the counsel that is
counselled for all the earth, and this is the hand that is stretched out over
all the nations. 
Isaiah
14:27  “For יהוה
of hosts has counselled, and who annuls it? And His hand that is stretched out,
who turns it back?” 
Isaiah
14:28  This is the message which came in
the year that Sovereign Aḥaz died: 
Isaiah
14:29  “Do not rejoice, all you of
Philistia, that the rod that smote you is broken; for out of the serpent’s roots
comes forth an adder, and its offspring is a fiery flying serpent. 
Isaiah
14:30  “And the first-born of the poor
shall feed, and the needy lie down in safety. And I shall kill your roots with
scarcity of food, and it shall slay your remnant. 
Isaiah
14:31  “Howl, O gate! Cry, O city! Melt
away, all you of Philistia! For smoke shall come from the north, and there is
no stranger in his ranks.” 
Isaiah
14:32  And what does one answer the
messengers of a nation? “That יהוה has founded Tsiyon,
and the poor of His people take refuge in it.” 
Isaiah
15:1  The message concerning Mo’aḇ.
Because in the night Ar of Mo’aḇ was laid waste, was silenced! Because in
the night Qir of Mo’aḇ was laid waste, was silenced! 
Isaiah
15:2  He has gone up to the house and Diḇon,
to the high places to weep. Mo’aḇ is wailing over Neḇo and over Mĕyḏeḇa;
on all their heads is baldness, and every beard is cut off. 
Isaiah
15:3  In their streets they shall put on
sackcloth; on the tops of their houses and in their streets everyone wails,
weeping bitterly.
Isaiah
15:4  And Ḥeshbon and El‛alĕh
cry out, their voice shall be heard as far as Yahats. Therefore the armed ones
of Mo’aḇ shout; his being shall tremble within him. 
Isaiah
15:5  My own heart is toward Mo’aḇ;
her fugitives cry unto Tso‛ar, like a three-year-old heifer. For by the
ascent of Luḥith they go up with weeping; for in the way of Ḥoronayim
they raise a cry of destruction. 
Isaiah
15:6  For the waters of Nimrim are
wastes, for the green grass has withered away; the grass fails, there is no
greenness. 
Isaiah
15:7  Therefore the wealth, acquired and
stored up, they take away to the wadi of the Willows. 
Isaiah
15:8  For the cry has gone all around the
borders of Mo’aḇ, its wailing to Eḡlayim and its wailing to Be’ĕr
Ĕlim. 
Isaiah
15:9  “For the waters of Dimon shall be
filled with blood; for I shall bring more upon Dimon, lions upon him who
escapes from Mo’aḇ, and on the remnant of the land.” 
Isaiah
16:1  Send a lamb to the ruler of the
land, from Sela to the wilderness, to the mountain of the daughter of Tsiyon. 
Isaiah
16:2  And it shall be, like a wandering
bird, a nest thrown out, so are the daughters of Mo’aḇ at the fords of
Arnon. 
Isaiah
16:3  “Bring counsel, execute judgment;
make your shadow like the night in the middle of the day; hide the outcasts, do
not betray him who escapes. 
Isaiah
16:4  “Let My outcasts dwell with you, O
Mo’aḇ; be a shelter to them from the face of the ravager. For the
oppressor has met his end, destruction has ceased, those trampling down have
perished from the land. 
Isaiah
16:5  “And in kindness the throne shall
be established. And One shall sit on it in truth, in the Tent of Dawiḏ,
judging and seeking right-ruling, and speeding righteousness.” 
Isaiah
16:6  We have heard of the pride of Mo’aḇ
– very proud – of his pride, his arrogance and his rage. His boastings are not
true. 
Isaiah
16:7  So Mo’aḇ wails for Mo’aḇ,
everyone wails. For the raisin-cakes of Qir Ḥareseth they moan. They are
utterly smitten. 
Isaiah
16:8  For the fields of Ḥeshbon
languish – the vine of Siḇmah. The masters of the gentiles have broken
down its choice plants, which have reached to Ya‛zĕr and wandered
through the wilderness. Her branches are stretched out, they are gone over the
sea. 
Isaiah
16:9  Therefore I bewail the vine of Siḇmah,
with the weeping of Ya‛zĕr. I water you with my tears, O Ḥeshbon
and El‛alĕh, for acclamation have fallen over your summer fruit and
your harvest. 
Isaiah
16:10  Gladness is taken away, and joy
from the orchard; in the vineyards there is no singing, nor shouting; No
treaders tread out wine in their presses; I have made their acclamation cease. 
Isaiah
16:11  Therefore my inward parts sound
like a lyre for Mo’aḇ, and my inner being for Qir Ḥeres. 
Isaiah
16:12  And it shall be, when it is seen
that Mo’aḇ has wearied herself on the high place, that she shall come to
her set-apart place to pray, but not be able. 
Isaiah
16:13  This is the word which יהוה
has spoken concerning Mo’aḇ since that time. 
Isaiah
16:14  But now יהוה
has spoken, saying, “Within three years, as the years of a hired man, the
esteem of Mo’aḇ is to be despised with all its great throng, and the
remnant be few, small and weak.” 
Isaiah
17:1  The message concerning Damascus. “See,
Damascus ceases to be a city, and shall become a heap of ruins. 
Isaiah
17:2  “The cities of Aro‛ĕr
are forsaken, they are for flocks which shall lie down, with no one to
frighten. 
Isaiah
17:3  “And the stronghold shall cease
from Ephrayim, and the reign from Damascus, and the remnant of Aram be as the
esteem of the sons of Yisra’ĕl,” declares יהוה of
hosts. 
Isaiah
17:4  “And in that day it shall be that
the esteem of Ya‛aqoḇ wanes, and the fatness of his flesh grows
lean. 
Isaiah
17:5  “And it shall be as when the
harvester gathers the grain, and reaps the heads with his arm. And it shall be
as he who gathers heads of grain in the Valley of Repha’im. 
Isaiah
17:6  “And gleaning grapes shall be left
in it, like the shaking of an olive tree, two or three olives at the top of the
uppermost branch, four or five in its most fruit-bearing branches,” declares יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl. 
Isaiah
17:7  In that day man shall look to his
Maker, and his eyes turn to the Set-apart One of Yisra’ĕl. 
Isaiah
17:8  And he shall not look to the
altars, the work of his hands; and he shall not see that which his own fingers
made, nor the Ashĕrim nor the sun-pillars. 
Isaiah
17:9  In that day his strong cities
become like a forsaken forest and an uppermost branch, which they left because
of the children of Yisra’ĕl. And it shall become a ruin. 
Isaiah
17:10  Because you have forgotten the
Elohim of your deliverance, and have not remembered the Rock of your
stronghold, therefore you shall plant pleasant plants and set out foreign
seedlings, 
Isaiah
17:11  by day make your plant to grow,
and in the morning make your seed to flourish – but the harvest is a heap in the day of grief and incurable pain. 
Isaiah
17:12  Woe to the uproar of many people
who make a noise like the roar of the seas, and to the rushing of nations that make
a rushing like the rushing of mighty waters – 
Isaiah
17:13  nations rushing like the rushing
of many waters. But He shall rebuke them and they shall flee far away, and be
chased like the chaff of the mountains before the wind, like whirling dust
before the whirlwind. 
Isaiah
17:14  At eventide, look! Alarm! Before
morning, it is no more. This is the portion of those who plunder us, and the
lot of those who rob us. 
Isaiah
18:1  Woe to the land shadowed with
whirring wings, which is beyond the rivers of Kush, 
Isaiah
18:2  which sends envoys by sea, even in
vessels of reed on the waters, saying, “Go, swift messengers, to a nation tall
and smooth-skinned, to a people dreaded from their beginning onward, a nation
mighty and trampling, whose land the rivers divide.” 
Isaiah
18:3  All inhabitants of the world, and
you that dwell on the earth: When a banner is lifted up on the mountains, look!
And when a ram’s horn is blown, hear! 
Isaiah
18:4  For thus יהוה
said to me, “I am still, and I watch in My dwelling place like dazzling heat in
sunshine, like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.” 
Isaiah
18:5  For before harvest, when the bud is
perfect and the sour grape is ripening in the flower, then He shall cut off the
twigs with pruning hooks, and shall cut down and take away the spreading
branches. 
Isaiah
18:6  They are left together for the
mountain birds of prey and for the beasts of the earth. And the birds of prey
shall summer on them, and all the beasts of the earth winter on them. 
Isaiah
18:7  In that time a present shall be
brought to יהוה of hosts from a people tall and
smooth-skinned, and from a people awesome from their beginning onward – a
nation mighty and trampling, whose land the rivers have divided – to the place
of the Name of יהוה of hosts, to Mount Tsiyon. 
Isaiah
19:1  The message concerning Mitsrayim.
See, יהוה is riding on a swift cloud, and He shall come
into Mitsrayim. And the idols of Mitsrayim shall tremble at His presence, and
the heart of Mitsrayim melt in its midst. 
Isaiah
19:2  “And I shall stir up Mitsrites
against Mitsrites, and they shall fight, each one against his brother, and each
one against his neighbour, city against city, reign against reign. 
Isaiah
19:3  “And the spirit of Mitsrayim shall
vanish within them, and I destroy their counsel. And they shall seek the idols
and the mutterers, the mediums and the sorcerers. 
Isaiah
19:4  “And I shall deliver the Mitsrites
into the hand of a cruel master, and a fierce sovereign to rule over them,”
declares the Master, יהוה of hosts.
Isaiah
19:5  And waters shall fail from the sea,
and the river wasted and dried up. 
Isaiah
19:6  And the rivers shall stink, and the
streams shall be weak and dried up. Reeds and rushes shall wither. 
Isaiah
19:7  Bare places by the River, by the
mouth of the River, and every sown field by the River shall wither. It shall be
driven away, and be no more. 
Isaiah
19:8  And the fishermen shall lament, and
all those who cast hooks into the River shall mourn, and they who spread nets
on the waters shall pine away. 
Isaiah
19:9  And those who work in fine flax,
and those who weave fine fabric shall become ashamed. 
Isaiah
19:10  And its foundations shall be
crushed, all the wage workers grieved in being. 
Isaiah
19:11  The princes of Tso‛an are
only fools; the counsel of Pharaoh’s wise ones have become senseless. How do
you say to Pharaoh, “I am the son of the wise, the son of ancient sovereigns?” 
Isaiah
19:12  Where are they? Where are your
wise men? Let them show you, and let them know what יהוה
of hosts has counselled against Mitsrayim. 
Isaiah
19:13  The princes of Tso‛an have
become fools, the princes of Noph are deceived. They, the corner-stone of her
tribes, have led Mitsrayim astray. 
Isaiah
19:14  יהוה has
mixed a perverse spirit in her midst. And they have led Mitsrayim astray in all
her work, as a drunkard strays in his vomit. 
Isaiah
19:15  And there is no work for
Mitsrayim, by either head or tail, palm branch or bulrush. 
Isaiah
19:16  In that day Mitsrayim shall become
like women, and tremble and fear because of the waving of the hand of יהוה
of hosts, which He waves over it. 
Isaiah
19:17  And the land of Yehuḏah
shall be a fear to Mitsrayim, everyone who mentions it fears for himself,
because of the counsel of יהוה of hosts which He has
counselled against it. 
Isaiah
19:18  In that day five cities in the
land of Mitsrayim shall speak the language of Kena‛an and swear by יהוה
of hosts, one is called the City of Destruction. 
Isaiah
19:19  In that day an altar to יהוה
shall be in the midst of the land of Mitsrayim, and a standing column to יהוה
at its border. 
Isaiah
19:20  And it shall be for a sign and for
a witness to יהוה of hosts in the land of Mitsrayim.
When they cry to יהוה because of the oppressors, He
sends them a Saviour and an Elohim, and shall deliver them. 
Isaiah
19:21  And יהוה
shall be known to Mitsrayim, and the Mitsrites shall know יהוה
in that day, and make slaughtering and meal offering, and shall make a vow to יהוה
and pay it. 
Isaiah
19:22  And יהוה
shall smite Mitsrayim, smite it and heal it. And they shall turn to יהוה,
and He shall hear them and heal them. 
Isaiah
19:23  In that day there shall be a
highway from Mitsrayim to Ashshur, and Ashshur shall come into Mitsrayim and Mitsrayim
into Ashshur, and Mitsrayim shall serve with Ashshur. 
Isaiah
19:24  In that day Yisra’ĕl shall be
one of three with Mitsrayim and Ashshur, even a blessing in the midst of the
earth, 
Isaiah
19:25  whom יהוה
of hosts shall bless, saying, “Blessed is Mitsrayim My people, and Ashshur the
work of My hands, and Yisra’ĕl My inheritance.” 
Isaiah
20:1  In the year that Tartan came to
Ashdoḏ, when Sargon the sovereign of Ashshur sent him, and he fought
against Ashdoḏ and took it, 
Isaiah
20:2  at that same time יהוה
spoke by means of Yeshayahu son of Amots, saying, “Go, and remove the sackcloth
from your body, and take your sandals off your feet.” And he did so, walking
naked and barefoot. 
Isaiah
20:3  And יהוה
said, “As My servant Yeshayahu has walked naked and barefoot three years for a
sign and a wonder against Mitsrayim and Kush, 
Isaiah
20:4  so does the sovereign of Ashshur
lead away the captives of Mitsrayim and the exiles of Kush, young and old,
naked and barefoot, with their buttocks uncovered – the shame of Mitsrayim. 
Isaiah
20:5  “And they shall be afraid and
ashamed of Kush, their expectation, and of Mitsrayim, their boast. 
Isaiah
20:6  “And the inhabitant of this
coastland shall say in that day, ‘See, such is our expectation, wherever we flee
for help to be delivered from the sovereign of Ashshur. And how do we escape?’ ”

Isaiah
21:1  The message concerning the
Wilderness of the Sea. As whirlwinds in the South sweep on, so it comes from
the wilderness, from an awesome land. 
Isaiah
21:2  A distressing vision is revealed to
me: the treacherous betrays, and the ravager ravages. Go up, O Ĕylam!
Besiege, O Media! All the groaning I bring to an end. 
Isaiah
21:3  Therefore my loins are filled with
anguish; pangs have seized me, like the pangs of a woman in labour. I was
distressed when I heard it; I was troubled when I saw it. 
Isaiah
21:4  My heart reeled, horror overwhelmed
me; the night for which I longed He turned into fear for me. 
Isaiah
21:5  Prepare the table, spread the mat,
eat and drink. Arise, you princes, anoint the shield! 
Isaiah
21:6  For יהוה
has said this to me, “Go, set a watchman, let him declare what he sees.” 
Isaiah
21:7  And he saw a chariot with a pair of
horsemen, a chariot of donkeys, and a chariot of camels, and he listened
attentively, very attentively. 
Isaiah
21:8  Then he cried, “A lion, O יהוה
! I stand continually on the watchtower in the daytime, and I have sat at my
post every night. 
Isaiah
21:9  “And see this, a chariot of men
coming with a pair of horsemen!” And he spoke up and said, “Baḇel is
fallen, is fallen! And all the carved images of her mighty ones He has broken
to the ground.” 
Isaiah
21:10  Oh, my threshing and the grain of
my floor! That which I have heard from יהוה of hosts,
the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, I have declared to you. 
Isaiah
21:11  The message concerning Dumah. He
calls to me out of Sĕ‛ir, “Watchman, how much of the night is
passed? Watchman, how much of the night has passed?” 
Isaiah
21:12  The watchman said, “Morning came,
and also the night. If you inquire, inquire. Come again!” 
Isaiah
21:13  The message concerning Araḇia.
In the forest in Araḇia you stay, O you travelling companies of Deḏanites.

Isaiah
21:14  You who dwell in the land of Tĕma,
bring water to him who is thirsty, meet the fugitive with bread. 
Isaiah
21:15  For they fled from the swords,
from the drawn sword, from the bent bow, and from the stress of battle. 
Isaiah
21:16  For thus יהוה
has said to me, “Within a year, according to the year of a hired man, all the
esteem of Qĕḏar shall come to an end, 
Isaiah
21:17  and the rest of the number of
archers, the mighty men of the people of Qĕḏar, shall be few. For יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl has spoken.” 
Isaiah
22:1  The message concerning the Valley
of Vision. What troubles you now, that you have all gone up to the house-tops, 
Isaiah
22:2  you who are filled with turmoils, a
noisy city, a city of revelry? Your slain are not slain with the sword, nor the
dead in battle. 
Isaiah
22:3  All your rulers have fled together;
without a bow they were taken captive. All who are found in you are bound
together, who have fled from afar. 
Isaiah
22:4  Therefore I said, “Look away from
me, let me weep bitterly. Do not try to comfort me because of the ravaging of
the daughter of my people.” 
Isaiah
22:5  For it is a day of uproar and
treading down and perplexity by the Master יהוה of
hosts in the Valley of Vision – breaking down of a wall and of crying to the
mountain. 
Isaiah
22:6  And Ĕylam bore the quiver with
chariots of men and horsemen, and Qir bared the shield. 
Isaiah
22:7  And it shall be that your choicest
valleys shall be filled with chariots, and the horsemen shall take up positions
at the gate. 
Isaiah
22:8  Then He removed the covering of Yehuḏah.
And you looked in that day to the weapons of the House of the Forest. 
Isaiah
22:9  And you saw the breaches of the
city of Dawiḏ, that it was great. And you gathered together the waters of
the lower pool. 
Isaiah
22:10  And you counted the houses of
Yerushalayim, and the houses you broke down to strengthen the wall. 
Isaiah
22:11  And you dug a ditch between the
two walls for the water of the old pool. But you have not looked to its Maker,
nor have you seen Him who fashioned it long ago. 
Isaiah
22:12  And in that day the Master יהוה
of hosts called for weeping and for mourning, for baldness and for girding with
sackcloth. 
Isaiah
22:13  Then see! Joy and gladness,
slaying oxen and killing sheep, eating meat and drinking wine, “Let us eat and
drink, for tomorrow we die!” 
Isaiah
22:14  And it was revealed in my hearing
by יהוה of hosts, “For this crookedness shall certainly
not be pardoned until you die,” said the Master יהוה of
hosts. 
Isaiah
22:15  Thus said the Master יהוה
of hosts, “Go, come to this steward, to Sheḇnah, who is over the house,
and say, 
Isaiah
22:16  ‘What have you here, and whom have
you here, that you have hewn a tomb here, as he who hews himself a tomb on
high, cutting out a resting place for himself in a rock?
Isaiah
22:17  ‘See, יהוה
is hurling you away, O man, and is firmly grasping you, 
Isaiah
22:18  rolling you up tightly like a
ball, into a wide land. There you are to die, and there your esteemed chariots
are to be the shame of your master’s house. 
Isaiah
22:19  ‘And I shall drive you from your
office, and you shall be ousted from your position. 
Isaiah
22:20  ‘And it shall be in that day, that
I shall call My servant Elyaqim son of Ḥilqiyahu. 
Isaiah
22:21  ‘And I shall put your robe on him,
and strengthen him with your girdle, and give your authority into his hand. And
he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Yerushalayim and to the house of
Yehuḏah. 
Isaiah
22:22  ‘And I shall place the key of the
house of Dawiḏ on his shoulder. And he shall open, and no one shuts; and shall
shut, and no one opens. 
Isaiah
22:23  ‘And I shall fasten him like a peg
in a steadfast place, and he shall become a throne of esteem to his father’s
house. 
Isaiah
22:24  ‘And they shall hang on him all
the weight of his father’s house, the offspring and the offshoots, all vessels
of small quantity, from the cups to all the jars. 
Isaiah
22:25  ‘In that day,’ declares יהוה
of hosts, ‘the peg that is fastened in the steadfast place shall be removed and
be cut down and fall, and the burden that was on it shall be cut off. For יהוה
has spoken.’ ” 
Isaiah
23:1  The message concerning Tsor. Howl,
you ships of Tarshish! For it has been destroyed, without house, without
harbour. From the land of Kittim it has been revealed to them. 
Isaiah
23:2  Be silent, you inhabitants of the
coastland, you merchants of Tsiḏon, who passed over the sea, they filled
you. 
Isaiah
23:3  And on great waters the grain of
Shiḥor, the harvest of the River, was her increase. And she was a
market-place for the nations. 
Isaiah
23:4  Be ashamed, O Tsiḏon, for the
sea has spoken, the stronghold of the sea, saying, “I have not laboured, nor
brought forth children; neither have I reared young men, brought up maidens.” 
Isaiah
23:5  Like the report of Mitsrayim, they
too are grieved at the report of Tsor. 
Isaiah
23:6  Pass over to Tarshish; wail, you
inhabitants of the coastland! 
Isaiah
23:7  Is this your city of revelry, whose
antiquity is from days of old, whose feet carried her far off to sojourn? 
Isaiah
23:8  Who has counselled this against
Tsor, the crowning city, whose merchants are chiefs, whose traders are the
esteemed of the earth? 
Isaiah
23:9  יהוה of
hosts has counselled it, to defile the pride of all splendour, and to shame all
the esteemed of the earth. 
Isaiah
23:10  Overflow through your land like
the River, O daughter of Tarshish; there is no more strength. 
Isaiah
23:11  He has stretched out His hand over
the sea, He shook the reigns; יהוה has given a command
against Kena‛an to destroy its strongholds. 
Isaiah
23:12  And He said, “Never again shall
you exult, O you oppressed maiden daughter of Tsiḏon. Arise, pass over to
Kittim, even there you shall find no rest.” 
Isaiah
23:13  See the land of the Chaldeans –
this people did not exist. Ashshur founded it for wild beasts of the desert.
They set up their siege-towers, they demolished her palaces, and made her a
ruin. 
Isaiah
23:14  Howl, you ships of Tarshish, for
your stronghold is laid waste! 
Isaiah
23:15  And in that day it shall be that
Tsor is forgotten seventy years, according to the days of one sovereign. At the
end of seventy years it shall be to Tsor as in the song of the whore: 
Isaiah
23:16  “Take a lyre, go about the city,
you forgotten whore; make sweet playing, sing many songs, so that you might be
remembered.” 
Isaiah
23:17  And at the end of seventy years it
shall be that יהוה visits Tsor. And she shall return to
her hire and commit whoring with all the reigns of the earth on the face of the
soil. 
Isaiah
23:18  And her goods and her hire shall
be set apart for יהוה, not treasured nor laid up, for
her gain is for those who dwell before יהוה, to eat
sufficiently, and for a choice covering. 
Isaiah
24:1  See, יהוה
is making the earth empty and making it waste, and shall overturn its surface,
and shall scatter abroad its inhabitants. 
Isaiah
24:2  And it shall be – as with the
people so with the priest, as with the servant so with his master, as with the
female servant so with her mistress, as with the buyer so with the seller, as
with the lender so with the borrower, as with the creditor so with the debtor; 
Isaiah
24:3  the earth is completely emptied and
utterly plundered, for יהוה has spoken this word. 
Isaiah
24:4  The earth shall mourn and wither,
the world shall languish and wither, the haughty people of the earth shall
languish. 
Isaiah
24:5  For the earth has been defiled
under its inhabitants, because they have transgressed the Torot, changed the
law, broken the everlasting covenant.
Isaiah
24:6  Therefore a curse shall consume the
earth, and those who dwell in it be punished. Therefore the inhabitants of the
earth shall be burned, and few men shall be left.
Isaiah
24:7  The new wine shall fail, the vine
shall languish, all those glad at heart shall sigh. 
Isaiah
24:8  The joy of the tambourine shall
cease, the noise of those who rejoice shall end, the joy of the lyre shall
cease. 
Isaiah
24:9  No more do they drink wine with a
song, strong drink is bitter to those who drink it. 
Isaiah
24:10  The deserted city shall be broken
down, every house shall be shut, no one enters. 
Isaiah
24:11  There is a crying for wine in the
streets; all joy shall be darkened, the gladness of the earth shall be gone. 
Isaiah
24:12  The city is left in ruins, and the
gate is stricken with destruction. 
Isaiah
24:13  For thus it is to be in the midst
of the earth among the peoples, like the shaking of an olive tree, like the
gleaning of grapes when the grape harvest is done. 
Isaiah
24:14  They lift up their voice, they
sing of the excellency of יהוה, they shall cry aloud
from the sea. 
Isaiah
24:15  Therefore praise יהוה
in the east, the Name of יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl
in the coastlands of the sea. 
Isaiah
24:16  From the ends of the earth we
shall hear songs, “Splendour to the Righteous One!” But I say, “I waste away, I
waste away! Woe to me! The treacherous betray, with treachery the treacherous
betray.” 
Isaiah
24:17  Fear and the pit and the snare are
upon you, O inhabitant of the earth. 
Isaiah
24:18  And it shall be that he who flees
from the noise of the fear falls into the pit, and he who comes up from the
midst of the pit is caught in the snare. For the windows from on high shall be
opened, and the foundations of the earth be shaken. 
Isaiah
24:19  The earth shall be utterly broken,
the earth shall be completely shattered, the earth shall be fiercely shaken. 
Isaiah
24:20  The earth shall stagger like a
drunkard. And it shall totter like a hut, and its transgression shall be heavy
upon it, and it shall fall, and not rise again. 
Isaiah
24:21  And in that day it shall be that יהוה
punishes on high the host of exalted ones, and on the earth the sovereigns of
the earth. 
Isaiah
24:22  And they shall be gathered
together, as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up in the
prison, and be punished after many days. 
Isaiah
24:23  And the moon shall blush, and the
sun shall be ashamed, for יהוה of hosts shall reign on
Mount Tsiyon, and in Yerushalayim, and before His elders, in esteem! 
Isaiah
25:1  O יהוה, You
are my Elohim. I exalt You, I praise Your Name, for You shall do a wonder –
counsels of long ago, trustworthiness, truth. 
Isaiah
25:2  For You shall make a city a heap, a
walled city a ruin, a palace of foreigners to be a city no more – never to be
rebuilt. 
Isaiah
25:3  Therefore a strong people praise
You, the city of the ruthless nations fear You. 
Isaiah
25:4  For You shall be a refuge to the
poor, a refuge to the needy in his distress, a shelter from the storm, a shade
from the heat. For the spirit of the ruthless is like a storm against a wall. 
Isaiah
25:5  You subdue the noise of foreigners,
as heat in a dry place; as heat in the shadow of a cloud, the singing of the
ruthless is subdued. 
Isaiah
25:6  And in this mountain יהוה
of hosts shall make for all people a feast of choice pieces, a feast of old
wines, of choice pieces with marrow, of old wines, well-refined. 
Isaiah
25:7  And He shall swallow up on this
mountain the surface of the covering which covers all people, and the veil
which is spread over all nations. 
Isaiah
25:8  He shall swallow up death forever,
and the Master יהוה shall wipe away tears from all
faces, and take away the reproach of His people from all the earth. For יהוה
has spoken. 
Isaiah
25:9  And it shall be said in that day, “See,
this is our Elohim. We have waited for Him, and He saves us. This is יהוה,
we have waited for Him, let us be glad and rejoice in His deliverance.” 
Isaiah
25:10  For the hand of יהוה
rests on this mountain, and Mo’aḇ is trodden down under Him, as straw is
trodden down in the water of a dunghill. 
Isaiah
25:11  And He shall spread out His hands
in their midst as he who swims spreads out his hands to swim, and He shall
bring down their pride together, with the skill of His hands. 
Isaiah
25:12  And the high stronghold of your
walls He shall bring down, lay it low, levelled to the ground, down to the
dust.
Isaiah
26:1  In that day this song is sung in
the land of Yehuḏah, “We have a strong city – He sets up deliverance,
walls and ramparts. 
Isaiah
26:2  “Open the gates, let the righteous
nation which guards the truth enter in. 
Isaiah
26:3  “The one steadfast of mind You
guard in perfect peace, for he trusts in You. 
Isaiah
26:4  “Trust in יהוה
forever, for in Yah, יהוה, is a rock of ages. 
Isaiah
26:5  “For He shall bring down those who
dwell on high. He lays the exalted city low, He lays it low to the earth, He
brings it down to the dust. 
Isaiah
26:6  “A foot tramples it down – feet of
the poor, footsteps of the needy.” 
Isaiah
26:7  The path of the righteous is
uprightness; O upright One, You weigh the course of the righteous. 
Isaiah
26:8  Also, in the path of Your
right-rulings, O יהוה, we have waited for You; the
longing of our being is for Your Name
and for the remembrance of You. 
Isaiah
26:9  My being longs for You in the
night, also, my spirit within me seeks You earnestly. For when Your
right-rulings are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world shall learn
righteousness. 
Isaiah
26:10  The wrong finds favour, yet he shall not learn righteousness; in
the land of straightforwardness he acts perversely, and does not see the
excellency of יהוה. 
Isaiah
26:11  O יהוה,
Your hand is high, they do not see. They see the ardour of the people and are ashamed;
also, let the fire for Your adversaries consume them. 
Isaiah
26:12  O יהוה,
You establish peace for us, for You have also done all our works in us. 
Isaiah
26:13  O יהוה our
Elohim, other masters besides You have had rule over us; only in You do we make
mention of Your Name. 
Isaiah
26:14  The dead do not live; the departed
spirits do not rise. Therefore You have visited and destroyed them, and made
all their remembrance to perish.
Isaiah
26:15  You shall increase the nation, O יהוה,
You shall increase the nation; You are esteemed; You shall expand all the
borders of the land. 
Isaiah
26:16  O יהוה, in
distress they shall visit You, they shall pour out a prayer when Your
disciplining is upon them. 
Isaiah
26:17  As a woman with child and about to
give birth writhes and cries out in her pain, so shall we be before Your face,
O יהוה. 
Isaiah
26:18  We have conceived, we writhed in
pain; we have given birth to wind. We have not accomplished deliverance in the
earth, nor have the inhabitants of the world fallen. 
Isaiah
26:19  Let Your dead live, together with my dead body, let them
arise. Awake and sing, you who dwell in dust; for Your dew is a dew of light,
and let the earth give birth to the departed spirits.
Isaiah
26:20  Go, my people, enter your rooms,
and shut your doors behind you; hide yourself, as it were, for a little while,
until the displeasure is past. 
Isaiah
26:21  For look, יהוה
is coming out of His place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their
crookedness. And the earth shall disclose her blood, and no longer cover her
slain. 
Isaiah
27:1  In that day יהוה
with His severe sword, great and strong, punishes Liwiathan the fleeing
serpent, Liwiathan that twisted serpent. And He shall slay the monster that is
in the sea. 
Isaiah
27:2  In that day sing to her, “A
vineyard of red wine! 
Isaiah
27:3  “I, יהוה,
do guard it, I water it every moment; lest any hurt it, I guard it night and
day. 
Isaiah
27:4  “Wrath is not in Me. Who would set
thornbushes and weeds against Me in battle? I would go through them, I would
burn them together. 
Isaiah
27:5  “Or let him take hold of My
strength and make peace with Me. Let him make peace with Me!” 
Isaiah
27:6  Those who come He causes to take
root in Ya‛aqoḇ, Yisra’ĕl shall blossom and bud. And they shall
fill the face of the world with fruit. 
Isaiah
27:7  Has He smitten him as He smote
those who were smiting him? Or were they slain as those they had slaughtered? 
Isaiah
27:8  In measure, by sending her away,
You contended with her. He shall take away by His rough wind in the day of the
east wind. 
Isaiah
27:9  Therefore by this the crookedness
of Ya‛aqoḇ is covered. And this is all the fruit of taking away his
sin: when he makes all the stones of the altar like chalkstones that are beaten
to dust – Ashĕrim and sun-pillars rise no more. 
Isaiah
27:10  For the city of defence is lonely,
a home forsaken and left like a wilderness – there the calf feeds, and there it
lies down, and shall consume its branches. 
Isaiah
27:11  When its twigs are dry, they are
broken off, women come and set them on fire. For it is a people of no
understanding, therefore He who made them has no compassion on them, and He who
formed them shows them no favour. 
Isaiah
27:12  And in that day it shall be that יהוה
threshes, from the channel of the River to the wadi of Mitsrayim. And you shall
be gathered one by one, O children of Yisra’ĕl.
Isaiah
27:13  And in that day it shall be that a
great horn is blown, and those who were perishing in the land of Ashshur and
the outcasts in the land of Mitsrayim shall come, and shall worship יהוה
on the set-apart mountain, in Yerushalayim. 
Isaiah
28:1  Woe to the proud crown of the
drunkards of Ephrayim, and to the fading flower of its splendid comeliness that
is on the head of the fertile valley, to those who are overcome with wine! 
Isaiah
28:2  See, יהוה
has one who is mighty and strong, like a downpour of hail and a destroying
storm, like a flood of mighty waters overflowing, who casts down to the earth
with the hand. 
Isaiah
28:3  The proud crown of the drunkards of
Ephrayim, is trampled under foot; 
Isaiah
28:4  and the fading flower of its
splendid comeliness that is on the head of the fertile valley, like the first
fruit before the summer, which, when one sees it, he eats it up while it is
still in his hand. 
Isaiah
28:5  In that day יהוה
of hosts is for a crown of splendour and a head-dress of comeliness to the
remnant of His people, 
Isaiah
28:6  and a spirit of right-ruling to him
who sits in right-ruling, and strength to those who turn back the battle at the
gate. 
Isaiah
28:7  And these too have gone astray
through wine, and through strong drink wandered about. Priest and prophet have
gone astray through strong drink, they are swallowed up by wine, they wander
about through strong drink, they go astray in vision, they stumble in
right-ruling. 
Isaiah
28:8  For all tables shall be covered
with vomit, no place without filth. 
Isaiah
28:9  Whom would He teach knowledge? And
whom would He make to understand the message? Those weaned from milk, those
taken from the breasts! 
Isaiah
28:10  For it is: command upon command,
command upon command, line upon line, line upon line, here a little, there a
little. 
Isaiah
28:11  For with a jabbering lip and a
foreign tongue He speaks to this people, 
Isaiah
28:12  to whom He said, “This is the
rest, give rest to the weary,” and, “This is the refreshing.” But they would
not hear. 
Isaiah
28:13  But the Word of יהוה
was to them, “Command upon command, command upon command, line upon line, line
upon line, here a little, there a little,” so that they go and shall stumble
backward, and be broken and snared and taken captive. 
Isaiah
28:14  Therefore hear the Word of יהוה,
you men of scorn, who rule this people who are in Yerushalayim, 
Isaiah
28:15  because you have said, “We have
made a covenant with death, and with the grave we have effected a vision. When
the overflowing scourge passes through, it does not come to us, for we have
made lying our refuge, and under falsehood we have hidden ourselves.” 
Isaiah
28:16  Therefore thus said the Master יהוה,
“See, I am laying in Tsiyon a stone for a foundation, a tried stone, a precious
corner-stone, a settled foundation. He who trusts shall not hasten away.
Isaiah
28:17  And I shall make right-ruling the
measuring line, and righteousness the plummet. And the hail shall sweep away
the refuge of lying, and the waters overflow the hiding place. 
Isaiah
28:18  And your covenant with death shall
be annulled, and your vision with the grave not stand. When an overflowing
scourge passes through, then you shall be trampled down by it. 
Isaiah
28:19  As often as it passes through it
shall take you, for it shall pass through every morning, and by day and by
night. And it shall be only trembling to understand the message.” 
Isaiah
28:20  For the bed shall be too short for
a man to stretch out on, and the covering shall be too narrow to wrap himself
in it. 
Isaiah
28:21  For יהוה
rises up as at Mount Peratsim, and He is wroth as at the Valley of Giḇ‛on,
to do His work, His strange work, and to do His deed, His strange deed. 
Isaiah
28:22  And now, do not be scoffers, lest
your bonds be made strong. For I have heard from the Master יהוה
of hosts, a destruction decreed upon all the earth. 
Isaiah
28:23  Give ear and hear my voice, listen
and hear my Word. 
Isaiah
28:24  Does the ploughman keep ploughing
all day to sow? Does he keep turning his soil and breaking the clods? 
Isaiah
28:25  When he has levelled its surface,
does he not sow the caraway and scatter the cummin, plant the wheat in rows,
the barley in the appointed place, and the spelt in its place? 
Isaiah
28:26  For He instructs him for
right-ruling, his Elohim teaches him. 
Isaiah
28:27  For caraway is not threshed with a
threshing sledge, nor is a wagon wheel rolled over cummin, but caraway is
beaten out with a stick, and cummin with a rod. 
Isaiah
28:28  Grain is crushed, so one does not
go on threshing it forever, nor break it with his wagon wheel, nor crush it
with his horsemen. 
Isaiah
28:29  Even this has come from יהוה
of hosts, who did wonders in counsel, who made wisdom great. 
Isaiah
29:1  Woe to Ari’ĕl, to Ari’ĕl,
the city where Dawiḏ dwelt! Add year to year, let festivals come around. 
Isaiah
29:2  “And I shall distress Ari’ĕl,
and there shall be mourning and sorrow, and it shall be to Me as Ari’ĕl. 
Isaiah
29:3  “And I shall encamp against you all
around, I shall lay siege against you with a mound, and I shall raise
siege-works against you. 
Isaiah
29:4  “And you shall be brought low and
speak out of the ground, and your speech shall be low, out of the dust. And
your voice shall be like a medium’s, out of the ground, and your speech whisper
out of the dust. 
Isaiah
29:5  “But the crowd of those strange to
you shall be like fine dust, and the crowd of the ruthless ones as chaff
blowing away. And it shall be in an instant, suddenly!” 
Isaiah
29:6  You shall be visited by יהוה
of hosts with thunder and earthquake and great noise, with whirlwind and storm,
and flame of devouring fire. 
Isaiah
29:7  Then the crowd of all the gentiles
who fight against Ari’ĕl, even all who fight against her and her
stronghold, and distress her, shall be as a dream of a night vision. 
Isaiah
29:8  And it shall be as when a hungry
man dreams, and see, he eats; but he awakes, and his being is empty; or as when
a thirsty man dreams, and see, he drinks; but he awakes, and see, he is faint,
and his being is longing. Thus shall the crowd of all the gentiles be who fight
against Mount Tsiyon. 
Isaiah
29:9  Pause and wonder! Blind yourselves
and be blind! They are drunk, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with
strong drink. 
Isaiah
29:10  For יהוה
has poured out on you the spirit of deep sleep, and has closed your eyes, the
prophets. And He has covered your heads, the seers. 
Isaiah
29:11  And the entire vision is to you
like the words of a book that is sealed, which men give to one who knows books,
saying, “Read this, please.” And he said, “I am unable, for it is sealed.” 
Isaiah
29:12  And the book is given to one who
does not know books, saying, “Read this, please.” And he said, “I have not
known books.” 
Isaiah
29:13  And יהוה
says, “Because this people has drawn near with its mouth, and with its lips
they have esteemed Me, and it has kept its heart far from Me, and their fear of
Me has become a command of men that is taught!
Isaiah
29:14  “Therefore, see, I am again doing
a marvellous work among this people, a marvellous work and a wonder. And the
wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their clever
men shall be hidden.” 
Isaiah
29:15  Woe to those who seek deep to hide
their counsel far from יהוה, and their works are in the
dark; they say, “Who sees us?” and, “Who knows us?” 
Isaiah
29:16  How perverse of you! Should the
potter be reckoned as the clay? Should what is made say of its Maker, “He did
not make me”? And what is formed say of Him who formed it, “He did not
understand”? 
Isaiah
29:17  Is it not yet a little while, and
Leḇanon shall be turned into garden land, and garden land be reckoned as
a forest? 
Isaiah
29:18  And in that day the deaf shall
hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of gloom,
and out of darkness. 
Isaiah
29:19  And the meek ones shall increase
their joy in יהוה, and the poor among men rejoice in
the Set-apart One of Yisra’ĕl. 
Isaiah
29:20  For the ruthless one is brought to
naught, the scorner is consumed, and all who watch for evil shall be cut off, 
Isaiah
29:21  those who make a man to sin in
word, and lay a snare for him who reproves in the gate, and turn aside the
righteous with empty reasoning. 
Isaiah
29:22  Therefore thus said יהוה,
who ransomed Aḇraham, concerning the house of Ya‛aqoḇ, “Ya‛aqoḇ
is no longer put to shame, no longer does his face grow pale.
Isaiah
29:23  “For when he sees his children,
the work of My hands, in his midst, they shall set apart My Name, and set apart
the Set-apart One of Ya‛aqoḇ, and fear the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl.

Isaiah
29:24  “And those who went astray in
spirit shall come to understanding, and the grumblers accept instruction.” 
Isaiah
30:1  “Woe to the stubborn children,”
declares יהוה, “to make counsel, but not from Me, and
to devise plans, but not of My Spirit, in order to add sin to sin; 
Isaiah
30:2  who are setting out to go down to
Mitsrayim, and have not asked My mouth, to be strengthened in the strength of
Pharaoh, and to seek refuge in the shadow of Mitsrayim! 
Isaiah
30:3  “And the strength of Pharaoh shall
become your shame, and the refuge in the shadow of Mitsrayim your confusion. 
Isaiah
30:4  “For his princes were at Tso‛an,
and his messengers came to Ḥanes. 
Isaiah
30:5  “They were all ashamed of a people
who do not profit them, not for help or profit, but a shame and also a
reproach.” 
Isaiah
30:6  The message concerning the beasts
of the South. Through a land of trouble and distress, from which came the
lioness and lion, the adder and fiery flying serpent, they convey their riches
on the backs of young donkeys, and their treasures on the humps of camels, to
an unprofitable people, 
Isaiah
30:7  even Mitsrayim, whose help is vain
and empty. Therefore I have called her Rahaḇ-Hĕm-Sheḇeth. 
Isaiah
30:8  And go, write it before them on a
tablet, and inscribe it on a scroll, that it is for a latter day, a witness
forever: 
Isaiah
30:9  that this is a rebellious people,
lying children, children who refuse to hear the Torah of יהוה,

Isaiah
30:10  who say to the seers, “Do not see,”
and to the prophets, “Do not prophesy to us what is right. Speak to us what is
smooth, prophesy deceits. 
Isaiah
30:11  “Turn aside from the way, swerve
from the path, cause the Set-apart One of Yisra’ĕl to cease from before
us.” 
Isaiah
30:12  Therefore thus said the Set-apart
One of Yisra’ĕl, “Because you despise this word, and trust in oppression
and perverseness, and rely on them, 
Isaiah
30:13  therefore this crookedness is to
you like a breach ready to fall, a bulge in a high wall, whose breaking comes
suddenly, swiftly.” 
Isaiah
30:14  And He shall break it like the
breaking of the potter’s vessel, which is broken in pieces, without sparing, so
that there is not found among its fragments a sherd to take fire from the
hearth, or to take water from the cistern. 
Isaiah
30:15  For thus said the Master יהוה,
the Set-apart One of Yisra’ĕl, “In returning and rest you are saved, in
stillness and trust is your strength.” But you would not, 
Isaiah
30:16  and you said, “No, for we flee
upon horses,” therefore you flee! And, “We ride on swift horses,” therefore
those who pursue you are swift! 
Isaiah
30:17  One thousand flee at the rebuke of one; at the rebuke of five you shall flee
until you are left as a pole on top of a mountain and as a sign on a hill. 
Isaiah
30:18  And therefore יהוה
shall wait, to show you favour. And therefore He shall be exalted, to have
compassion on you. For יהוה is an Elohim of
right-ruling. Blessed are all those who wait for Him. 
Isaiah
30:19  For the people shall dwell in
Tsiyon at Yerushalayim, you shall weep no more. He shall show much favour to
you at the sound of your cry; when He hears, He shall answer you. 
Isaiah
30:20  Though יהוה
gave you bread of adversity and water of affliction, your Teacher shall no
longer be hidden. But your eyes shall see your Teacher,
Isaiah
30:21  and your ears hear a word behind
you, saying, “This is the Way, walk in it,” whenever you turn to the right, or
whenever you turn to the left. 
Isaiah
30:22  And you shall defile the covering
of your graven images of silver, and the plating of your moulded images of
gold. You shall throw them away as a menstrual cloth and say to them, “Be gone!”

Isaiah
30:23  And He shall give the rain for
your seed with which you sow the ground, and bread of the increase of the
earth. And it shall be fat and rich, your cattle grazing in an enlarged pasture
in that day, 
Isaiah
30:24  and the oxen and the young donkeys
that work the ground eat seasoned fodder winnowed with shovel and fan. 
Isaiah
30:25  And on every high mountain and on
every high hill there shall be rivers and streams of waters, in the day of
great slaughter, when the towers fall. 
Isaiah
30:26  And the light of the moon shall be
as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun be sevenfold, as the light of
seven days, in the day that יהוה binds up the breach of
His people, and heals the wound of His blows. 
Isaiah
30:27  See, the Name of יהוה
is coming from afar, burning with His wrath, and heavy smoke. His lips shall be
filled with rage, and His tongue be as a devouring fire; 
Isaiah
30:28  and His breath shall be as an
overflowing stream, which reaches up to the neck, to sift the nations with a
sieve of falsehood, and a misleading bridle on the jaws of the peoples.
Isaiah
30:29  Let the song be to you as in a
night set apart for a festival, and gladness of heart as he who is going with a
flute, to come into the mountain of יהוה, to the Rock
of Yisra’ĕl. 
Isaiah
30:30  And יהוה
shall cause His excellent voice to be heard, and show the coming down of His
arm, with raging wrath and the flame of a consuming fire, with scattering,
downpour and hailstones. 
Isaiah
30:31  For through the voice of יהוה
Ashshur is broken down, with a rod He smites. 
Isaiah
30:32  And every passage of the ordained
staff which יהוה lays on him, shall be with tambourines
and lyres, when He shall fight with it, battling with a brandishing arm. 
Isaiah
30:33  For Topheth was ordained of old,
even for the sovereign it has been prepared. He has made it deep and large, its
fire pit with much wood; the breath of יהוה, as a
stream of burning sulphur, is burning in it! 
Isaiah
31:1  Woe to those who go down to Mitsrayim
for help, and rely on horses, who trust in chariots because they are many, and
in horsemen because they are very strong, but who do not look to the Set-apart
One of Yisra’ĕl, nor seek יהוה ! 
Isaiah
31:2  And He also is wise, and has
brought evil, and has not turned aside His words. And He shall rise up against
the house of evil-doers, and against the help of workers of wickedness. 
Isaiah
31:3  And the Mitsrites are men, and not Ĕl.
And their horses are flesh, and not spirit. And when יהוה
stretches out His hand, both he who helps shall stumble, and he who is helped
shall fall. And they shall all fall, together. 
Isaiah
31:4  For this is what יהוה
has said to me, “As a lion roars, and a young lion over his prey, though a band
of shepherds is called out against him, he is not afraid of their voice nor
disturbed by their noise, so יהוה of hosts shall come
down to fight upon Mount Tsiyon and upon its hill. 
Isaiah
31:5  “Like hovering birds, so does יהוה
of hosts protect Yerushalayim – protecting and delivering, passing over and
rescuing.” 
Isaiah
31:6  Turn back to Him from whom the
children of Yisra’ĕl have deeply fallen away. 
Isaiah
31:7  For in that day, let each man
reject his idols of silver and his idols of gold, which your own hands have
made for yourselves, as a sin. 
Isaiah
31:8  “And Ashshur shall fall by a sword
not of man, and a sword not of mankind shall devour him. But he shall flee from
the sword, and his young men shall become slave labour, 
Isaiah
31:9  and his strength pass away because
of fear, and his commanders shall be afraid of the banner,” declares יהוה,
whose light is in Tsiyon and whose furnace is in Yerushalayim. 
Isaiah
32:1  See, a sovereign shall reign in
righteousness, and rulers rule in right-ruling. 
Isaiah
32:2  And each one shall be as a hiding
place from the wind, and a shelter from the downpour, as rivers of water in a
dry place, as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land. 
Isaiah
32:3  And the eyes of those who see are
not dim, and the ears of those who hear listen. 
Isaiah
32:4  And the heart of the rash
understand knowledge, and the tongue of the stammerers hurries to speak
plainly. 
Isaiah
32:5  A fool is no longer called noble,
nor the scoundrel said to be respectable; 
Isaiah
32:6  for a fool speaks folly, and his
heart works wickedness: to practise filthiness, and to speak against יהוה
that which misleads, to starve the being of the hungry, and to withhold the
drink from the thirsty. 
Isaiah
32:7  And the methods of the scoundrel
are evil – he has devised wicked plans to destroy the poor with words of
falsehood, even when the needy pleads for right-ruling. 
Isaiah
32:8  But the generous one devises what
is generous, and by generous deeds he rises up. 
Isaiah
32:9  Rise up, you women who are at ease,
hear my voice; rise up you complacent
daughters, listen to my speech. 
Isaiah
32:10  In little more than a year you
shall be troubled, you complacent women; for the grape harvest shall fail, the
ingathering shall not come. 
Isaiah
32:11  Tremble, you women who are at
ease; be troubled, you complacent ones; strip yourselves, make yourselves bare,
and gird sackcloth on your waists. 
Isaiah
32:12  Lament upon the breasts for the
pleasant fields, for the fruit-bearing vine. 
Isaiah
32:13  Weeds and thornbushes come up over
the ground of My people, indeed, over all the houses of joy, the city of
revelry; 
Isaiah
32:14  for the palace is abandoned, the
crowded city deserted. Hill and watchtower serve as caves forever, a joy of
wild donkeys, a pasture of flocks; 
Isaiah
32:15  until the Spirit is poured upon us
from on high, and the wilderness shall become garden-land, and the garden-land
be reckoned as a forest. 
Isaiah
32:16  Then right-ruling shall dwell in
the wilderness, and righteousness remain in the garden-land. 
Isaiah
32:17  The work of righteousness shall be
peace, and the service of righteousness be rest and safety forever. 
Isaiah
32:18  And My people shall dwell in a
home of peace, and in safe dwellings, and in undisturbed resting places, 
Isaiah
32:19  even when hail shall fall, felling
the forest, and the city be brought low in humiliation. 
Isaiah
32:20  Blessed are you who sow beside all
waters, who send out the foot of the ox and the donkey. 
Isaiah
33:1  Woe to you ravager, while you have
not been ravaged, and you treacherous, while they have not betrayed you! When
you have ceased ravaging, you shall be ravaged. And when you stop betraying,
they shall betray you. 
Isaiah
33:2  O יהוה,
show us favour, for we have waited for You. Be their arm every morning, our
deliverance also in time of distress. 
Isaiah
33:3  At the noise of the rumbling the
people shall flee. When You lift Yourself up, the gentiles shall be scattered. 
Isaiah
33:4  And Your plunder shall be gathered
like the gathering of the caterpillar; as locusts rush about, they rush upon
them. 
Isaiah
33:5  יהוה is
exalted, for He dwells on high; He has filled Tsiyon with right-ruling and
righteousness. 
Isaiah
33:6  And He shall be the trustworthiness
of your times, a wealth of deliverance, wisdom and knowledge. The fear of יהוה
– that is His treasure. 
Isaiah
33:7  See, their brave ones shall cry
outside, the messengers of peace weep bitterly. 
Isaiah
33:8  The highways shall be deserted, the
wayfaring man shall have ceased. He has broken the covenant, he has despised
the cities, he respected no man. 
Isaiah
33:9  The earth shall mourn and languish,
Leḇanon shall be ashamed. Sharon shall be withered like a desert, and
Bashan and Karmel be shaking. 
Isaiah
33:10  “Now I rise up,” declares יהוה.
“Now I am exalted, now I am lifted up. 
Isaiah
33:11  “You conceive chaff, you bring
forth stubble, your spirit devours you like fire. 
Isaiah
33:12  “And peoples shall be like the
burnings of lime, like thorns cut up they are burned in the fire. 
Isaiah
33:13  “You who are afar off, hear what I
shall do; and you who are near, know My might.” 
Isaiah
33:14  Sinners in Tsiyon shall be afraid;
trembling shall grip the defiled ones, “Who of us shall dwell with the
devouring fire? Who of us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?” 
Isaiah
33:15  He who walks righteously and
speaks what is straight, he who rejects the gain of oppressions, who keeps his
hands from accepting bribes, who stops his ears from hearing of bloodshed, and
shuts his eyes from seeing evil – 
Isaiah
33:16  he shall inhabit the heights;
strongholds of rocks be his refuge. His bread shall be given him, his water be
steadfast. 
Isaiah
33:17  Your eyes shall see the Sovereign
in His comeliness, see a land that is far off. 
Isaiah
33:18  Your heart ponders fear, “Where is
the scribe? Where is he who weighs? Where is he who counts the towers?” 
Isaiah
33:19  No longer shall you see a fierce
people, a people of too deep a lip to hear, of a jabbering tongue no one
understands.
Isaiah
33:20  See Tsiyon, the city of our
appointed time; your eyes shall see Yerushalayim, an undisturbed home, a tent
not taken down. Its stakes are never removed, nor any of its cords broken. 
Isaiah
33:21  But there, great is יהוה
for us; a place of broad rivers, streams, in which no boat with oars sails, nor
big ships pass by –
