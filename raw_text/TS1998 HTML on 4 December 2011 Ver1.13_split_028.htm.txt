Qoheleth/Ecclesiastes
Eccl
1:1  The words of Qoheleth, son of Dawiḏ,
sovereign in Yerushalayim.
Eccl
1:2  “Futility! Futility!” says Qoheleth.
“Futility, futility, all is futile!” 
Eccl
1:3  What does man gain from all his
labour in which he toils under the sun? 
Eccl
1:4  A generation passes away, and a
generation comes, but the earth stands forever. 
Eccl
1:5  The sun also rises, and the sun
sets, and hurries back to the place where it arose. 
Eccl
1:6  Going to the south, and turning
round to the north, turning, turning, and on its rounds the wind returns. 
Eccl
1:7  All the rivers run into the sea, yet
the sea never overflows. To the place from which the rivers come, there they
return again. 
Eccl
1:8  All matters are wearisome, no one is
able to speak of it. The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled
with hearing. 
Eccl
1:9  What has been is what shall be, what
has been done is what shall be done, and there is no new matter under the sun. 
Eccl
1:10  Is there a matter of which it is
said, “See, this is new”? It was here already, long ago. 
Eccl
1:11  There is no remembrance of former
ones, nor is there any remembrance of those that are to come by those who come
later on. 
Eccl
1:12  I, Qoheleth, was sovereign over
Yisra’ĕl in Yerushalayim. 
Eccl
1:13  And I set my heart to seek and
search out by wisdom concerning all that has been done under the heavens; this
evil task Elohim has given to the sons of man, to be humbled by it. 
Eccl
1:14  I have seen all the works that are
done under the sun. And see, all was futile and feeding on wind. 
Eccl
1:15  The crooked could not be
straightened, and what is lacking could not be counted. 
Eccl
1:16  So I spoke to my heart, saying, “See,
I have attained greatness, and have gained more wisdom than all who were before
me in Yerushalayim. And my heart has seen much wisdom and knowledge.” 
Eccl
1:17  And I set my heart to know wisdom –
and to know madness and folly. I know that this too is feeding on wind. 
Eccl
1:18  For in much wisdom is much grief,
and he who increases knowledge increases suffering. 
Eccl
2:1  I said in my heart, “Come now, let
me try you with rejoicing and find out what is good.” But see, that too was
futile. 
Eccl
2:2  I said of laughter, “It is madness,”
and of rejoicing, “What does it do?” 
Eccl
2:3  I searched in my heart how to
stimulate my body with wine, while guiding my heart with wisdom, and how to lay
hold on folly, until I could see what was good for the sons of men to do under
the heavens all the days of their lives. 
Eccl
2:4  I made my works great, I built
myself houses, I planted vineyards for myself. 
Eccl
2:5  I made gardens and parks for myself,
and I planted all kinds of fruit trees in them. 
Eccl
2:6  I made pools of water for myself, to
water from them a plantation of growing trees. 
Eccl
2:7  I bought male and female servants,
and I came to have sons of the household. Also, I had greater possessions of
herds and flocks than all who were before me in Yerushalayim. 
Eccl
2:8  I also gathered for myself silver
and gold and the treasures of sovereigns and of the provinces. I provided male
and female singers for myself, and the pleasures of men – a woman and women. 
Eccl
2:9  Thus I became great and increased
more than all who were before me in Yerushalayim. Also my wisdom remained with
me. 
Eccl
2:10  And all that my eyes desired I did
not keep from them. I did not withhold my heart from any pleasure, for my heart
rejoiced in all my labour. And this was my portion from all my labour. 
Eccl
2:11  But when I looked on all the works
that my hands had done and on the labour in which I had toiled, see, all was
futile and feeding on wind, and there was no gain under the sun. 
Eccl
2:12  And I turned myself to look at
wisdom, and madness, and folly. For what would the man do who comes after the
sovereign except what already has
been done? 
Eccl
2:13  Then I saw that wisdom is better
than folly, as light is better than darkness. 
Eccl
2:14  The wise one’s eyes are in his
head, but the fool walks in darkness. And I also knew that one event befalls
them all. 
Eccl
2:15  And I said in my heart, “As the
event of the fool, even so it befalls me, and why was I then more wise?” Then I
said in my heart, “This also is futile.” 
Eccl
2:16  For there is no more lasting
remembrance of the wise than of the fool, since in the days to come all is
forgotten. And how does a wise man die? With the fool! 
Eccl
2:17  And I hated life because the work
that was done under the sun was evil on me, for all is futile and feeding on
wind. 
Eccl
2:18  And I hated all my labour in which
I had toiled under the sun, because I leave it to a man who would come after
me. 
Eccl
2:19  And who knows whether he is wise or
foolish? Yet he shall rule over all my labour in which I toiled and in which I
have shown myself wise under the sun. That too is futile. 
Eccl
2:20  So I turned my heart and despaired
of all the labour in which I had toiled under the sun. 
Eccl
2:21  For a man might labour with wisdom,
knowledge, and skill; yet he leaves his heritage to a man who has not laboured
for it. That too is futile and a great evil. 
Eccl
2:22  For what does a man get for all his
labour and strain of his heart with which he has toiled under the sun? 
Eccl
2:23  For all his days are sufferings,
and his work grievous; even in the night his heart takes no rest. That too is
futile. 
Eccl
2:24  A man could do no better but to eat
and drink, and enjoy himself in his labour! That too, I saw, was from the hand
of Elohim. 
Eccl
2:25  For who eats or who finds enjoyment
without Him? 
Eccl
2:26  For He gives wisdom and knowledge
and joy to a man who is good in His eyes. But to the sinner He gives the task
of gathering and collecting, to give to
him who is good before Elohim. That too is futile and feeding on wind. 
Eccl
3:1  For every matter there is an appointed time, even a time for every pursuit
under the heavens: 
Eccl
3:2  A time to be born, and a time to
die; a time to plant, and a time to uproot; 
Eccl
3:3  a time to slay, and a time to heal;
a time to break down, and a time to build up; 
Eccl
3:4  a time to weep, and a time to laugh;
a time to mourn, and a time to dance; 
Eccl
3:5  a time to throw away stones, and a
time to gather stones; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;

Eccl
3:6  a time to seek, and a time to lose;
a time to keep, and a time to throw away; 
Eccl
3:7  a time to tear, and a time to sew; a
time to be silent, and a time to speak; 
Eccl
3:8  a time to love, and a time to hate;
a time for battle, and a time for peace. 
Eccl
3:9  What does the worker gain from his
toil? 
Eccl
3:10  I have seen the task Elohim has
given to the sons of men to be humbled by it. 
Eccl
3:11  He has made it all, pretty in its
time. Even the ages He has put in their hearts, except that no one finds out
the work that Elohim does from beginning to end. 
Eccl
3:12  I know that there is no good for
them but to rejoice, and to do good in their lives, 
Eccl
3:13  and also that every man should eat
and drink and enjoy the good of all his labour, it is a gift of Elohim. 
Eccl
3:14  I know that whatever Elohim does is
forever. There is no adding to it, and there is no taking from it. Elohim does
it, that men should fear before Him. 
Eccl
3:15  Whatever is has already been, and
what shall be has been before. But Elohim seeks out what has been pursued. 
Eccl
3:16  Then again I saw under the sun: In
the place of right-ruling, wrongness was there. And in the place of
righteousness, wrongness was there. 
Eccl
3:17  I said in my heart, “Elohim judges
the righteous and the wrong, for there is a time for every matter and for every
work.” 
Eccl
3:18  I said in my heart, “Concerning the
matter of the sons of men, Elohim selects them, so as to see that they
themselves are beasts.” 
Eccl
3:19  For the event of the sons of men is
also the event of beasts – one event befalls them: as one dies, so dies the
other. Indeed, they all have one breath – man has no advantage over beasts. For
all is futile. 
Eccl
3:20  All are going to one place – all
came from the dust, and all return to dust. 
Eccl
3:21  Who knows the spirit of the sons of
men, which goes upward, and the spirit of the beast, which goes down to the
earth? 
Eccl
3:22  So I saw that man could do no
better but to rejoice in his own works, for that is his portion. For who would
bring him to see what shall be after him? 
Eccl
4:1  Then I looked again at all the
oppression that is done under the sun: And see! The tears of the oppressed, but
they have no comforter; and power on the side of their oppressors, but they
have no comforter. 
Eccl
4:2  Therefore I commended the dead who
were already dead, more than the living who are still alive. 
Eccl
4:3  And better than both is he who has
never existed, who has not seen the evil work that is done under the sun. 
Eccl
4:4  And I saw that all the toil and
skill of the work bring envy between man and his neighbour. That too is futile
and feeding on wind. 
Eccl
4:5  The fool folds his hands and
consumes his own flesh. 
Eccl
4:6  Better is a hand filled with rest
than both hands filled with toil and feeding on wind. 
Eccl
4:7  Then I looked again at futility
under the sun: 
Eccl
4:8  There is one, without a second, who
has neither son nor brother. And there is no end to all his labours. His eye
also is not satisfied with riches. “And for whom am I toiling and depriving
myself of good?” That too is futility, and an evil task. 
Eccl
4:9  Two are better than one, because
they have a good reward for their labour. 
Eccl
4:10  For if they fall, one lifts his
companion up. But woe to him who is alone when he falls, for he has no one to
help him up. 
Eccl
4:11  Also, if two lie down together,
they keep warm; but how does one keep warm by
himself? 
Eccl
4:12  Although one might be overpowered,
two withstand him. And a threefold cord is not readily broken. 
Eccl
4:13  A poor and wise youth is better
than an old and foolish sovereign who no longer knows how to take warning. 
Eccl
4:14  For he comes out of prison to be
sovereign, although in his reign he was born poor. 
Eccl
4:15  I have seen all the living who walk
under the sun; they were with the second youth who stands in his place. 
Eccl
4:16  There was no end of all the people;
all of whom he headed. But the ones who come afterward do not rejoice in him.
For that too is futile and feeding on wind. 
Eccl
5:1  Guard your steps when you go to the
House of Elohim. And draw near to listen rather than to give the slaughtering
of fools, for they do not know that they do evil. 
Eccl
5:2  Do not be hasty with your mouth, and
let not your heart hurry to bring forth a word before Elohim. For Elohim is in
the heavens, and you on earth, therefore let your words be few. 
Eccl
5:3  For a dream comes through the
greatness of the task, and a fool’s voice is known by his many words. 
Eccl
5:4  When you make a vow to Elohim, do
not delay to pay it, for He takes no
pleasure in fools. Pay that which you have vowed. 
Eccl
5:5  It is better not to vow than to vow
and not pay. 
Eccl
5:6  Do not allow your mouth to cause
your flesh to sin, nor say before the messenger of Elohim that it was a
mistake. Why should Elohim be wroth at your voice and destroy the work of your
hands? 
Eccl
5:7  For in much dreaming and many words
there is futility. But fear Elohim. 
Eccl
5:8  If you see the oppression of the
poor, and denial of right-ruling and righteousness in a province, do not be
astonished at the matter. For a higher than the high is guarding, and there are
higher ones over them. 
Eccl
5:9  And the increase of the land is for
all. The sovereign himself is served from the field. 
Eccl
5:10  He who loves silver is not
satisfied with silver; nor he who loves wealth, and increase. That too is futile. 
Eccl
5:11  With the increase of goods, there
is an increase of those consuming them. What advantage then is there to their
owners, but to look on? 
Eccl
5:12  Sweet is the sleep of a labourer
whether he eats little or much, but the plenty of the rich does not let him
sleep. 
Eccl
5:13  There is a sickly evil I have seen
under the sun: riches kept for their owner, for his evil. 
Eccl
5:14  But those riches perish through
evil use. And he brings forth a son, and there is naught in his hand. 
Eccl
5:15  As he came naked from his mother’s
womb, so he returns, to go as he came. And from his labour which goes into his
hand he takes none whatsoever. 
Eccl
5:16  And this too is a grievous evil –
exactly as he came, so he goes. And what gain has he since he toiled for the
wind? 
Eccl
5:17  All his days he also eats in
darkness, and with much sorrow and sickness and wrath. 
Eccl
5:18  See what I have seen: It is good
and pleasant for one to eat and drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labour
in which he toils under the sun all the days of his life which Elohim gives
him, for it is his portion. 
Eccl
5:19  Further, when Elohim has given any
man riches and wealth, and permitted him to enjoy them, and to receive his
portion and rejoice in his labour, this is a gift of Elohim. 
Eccl
5:20  Though it not be much, let him
remember the days of his life, because Elohim bears witness by the gladness of
his heart. 
Eccl
6:1  There is an evil which I have seen
under the sun, and it is great among men: 
Eccl
6:2  A man to whom Elohim has given
riches and wealth and esteem, so that his being lacks none at all of what he
desires, but Elohim does not permit him to eat of it, and a foreigner consumes
it. This is futile, and it is an evil disease. 
Eccl
6:3  If a man brings forth a hundred children and lives many years, so that
the days of his years are many, but his being is not satisfied with goodness,
or indeed he has no burial, I say that a premature birth is better than he, 
Eccl
6:4  for it comes in futility and goes
away in darkness, and in darkness its name is covered; 
Eccl
6:5  even the sun it has not seen – it
has more rest than that man. 
Eccl
6:6  And though he lives a thousand years
twice over, yet he shall not see goodness. Do not all go to one place? 
Eccl
6:7  All the labour of man is for his
mouth, and yet the appetite is not satisfied. 
Eccl
6:8  For what advantage has the wise over the fool? What advantage does the poor
have who knows how to walk before the living? 
Eccl
6:9  What the eyes see is better than
what the desire goes after. That too is futile and feeding on wind. 
Eccl
6:10  Whatever shall be, has already been
named, and it is known that he is son of Aḏam. And he is unable to
contend with Him who is mightier than he. 
Eccl
6:11  The more words, the more futility –
what is to man the advantage? 
Eccl
6:12  For who knows what is good for man
in life, all the days of his futile life, which he passes like a shadow? For
who declares to man what shall be after him, under the sun? 
Eccl
7:1  A good name is better than precious oil, and the day of death than
the day of one’s birth. 
Eccl
7:2  It is better to go to the house of
mourning than to go to the house of feasting, for that is the end of all men.
And the living take it to heart. 
Eccl
7:3  Sorrow is better than laughter, for
by the sadness of the face the heart becomes better. 
Eccl
7:4  The heart of the wise is in the
house of mourning, but the heart of fools is in the house of rejoicing. 
Eccl
7:5  It is better to hear the rebuke of
the wise than for man to hear the song of fools. 
Eccl
7:6  For as the crackling of thorns under
a pot, so is the laughter of a fool. That too is futile. 
Eccl
7:7  For oppression makes a wise one mad,
and a bribe destroys the heart. 
Eccl
7:8  The end of a matter is better than
its beginning. The patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit. 
Eccl
7:9  Do not be hasty in your spirit to be
vexed, for vexation rests in the bosom of fools. 
Eccl
7:10  Do not say, “Why were the former
days better than these?” For it is not wise of you to have asked about this. 
Eccl
7:11  Wisdom is good with an inheritance,
and an advantage to those who see the sun. 
Eccl
7:12  For wisdom protects as silver
protects, but the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom gives life to those who
have it. 
Eccl
7:13  See the work of Elohim: For who is
able to make straight what He has made crooked? 
Eccl
7:14  Be glad in the day of prosperity,
but in the evil day take note that Elohim has also appointed the one as well as
the other, so that man should not uncover whatever shall be after him. 
Eccl
7:15  I have seen it all in my days of
futility: There is a righteous one perishing in his righteousness, and there is
a wrong one living long in his evil. 
Eccl
7:16  Do not be overrighteous, neither be
overwise – why destroy yourself? 
Eccl
7:17  Do not be wrong overmuch, and do not
be a fool – why die before your time? 
Eccl
7:18  It is good that you should take
hold of this, and also not withhold your hand from the other. For he who fears
Elohim comes forth with all of them. 
Eccl
7:19  Wisdom makes the wise strong, more
than ten rulers that are in the city. 
Eccl
7:20  For there is not a righteous man on
earth who does good and does not sin. 
Eccl
7:21  Also do not take to heart all the
words they speak, lest you hear your servant cursing you. 
Eccl
7:22  For you know in your heart that
many times you have cursed others. 
Eccl
7:23  All this I have proved by wisdom. I
said, “I am wise,” but it was far from me. 
Eccl
7:24  That which is, is far off and
exceedingly deep – who does find it? 
Eccl
7:25  I have turned round, even my heart,
to know and to search, and to seek out wisdom and a conclusion, to know the
wrongness of folly, even of foolishness and madness. 
Eccl
7:26  And I found more bitter than death,
the woman whose heart is snares and nets, whose hands are shackles. He who
pleases Elohim escapes from her, but the sinner is captured by her. 
Eccl
7:27  “See, this I have found,” says
Qoheleth, “ Counting one by one, to
find a conclusion, 
Eccl
7:28  which my being still seeks but have
not found: I have found one man among a thousand, but a woman among all these I
have not found. 
Eccl
7:29  Truly, this only I have found: that
Elohim made man straight, but they have sought out many devices.” 
Eccl
8:1  Who is like a wise one? And who knows
the meaning of a matter? A man’s wisdom makes his face shine, and the hardness
of his face is changed. 
Eccl
8:2  I say, “Guard the sovereign’s command because of the oath before
Elohim. 
Eccl
8:3  Do not be in a hurry to go from his
presence. Do not take a stand in an evil matter, for he does whatever he
pleases.” 
Eccl
8:4  Where the word of a sovereign is,
there is power. And who says to him, “What are you doing?” 
Eccl
8:5  He who guards the command knows no
evil matter. And the heart of the wise discerns both time and right-ruling, 
Eccl
8:6  Because for every matter there is a
time and right-ruling, though the trouble of man is heavy upon him. 
Eccl
8:7  For he does not know what shall be;
so who declares to him when it shall be? 
Eccl
8:8  No one has power over the spirit to
retain the spirit, and no one has power in the day of death. There is no
discharge in battle, and wrongness does not release those who are given to it. 
Eccl
8:9  All this I have seen; I applied my
heart to every work that is done under the sun: There is a time in which a man
rules over a man for his evil. 
Eccl
8:10  And so I saw the wrong ones buried,
and they came and went from the place of set-apartness, and they were forgotten
in the city where they had so done. That too is futile. 
Eccl
8:11  Because the sentence against an
evil deed is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is
filled in them to do evil. 
Eccl
8:12  Although a sinner is doing evil a
hundred times, and his life is
prolonged, yet I know that there is good to those who fear Elohim, who fear
before Him. 
Eccl
8:13  But it shall not be well with the
wrong one, nor would he prolong his days as a shadow, because he does not fear
before Elohim. 
Eccl
8:14  There is a futility which has been
done on earth, that there are righteous ones who get according to the deeds of
the wrong. And there are wrong ones who get according to the deeds of the
righteous. I said that this too is futile. 
Eccl
8:15  Therefore I praised enjoyment,
because there is no good to man except to eat, and to drink, and to rejoice –
and it remains with him in his labour for the days of his life which Elohim has
given him under the sun. 
Eccl
8:16  When I gave my heart to know wisdom
and to see the task which has been done on earth, even though one sees no sleep
day or night, 
Eccl
8:17  then I saw all the work of Elohim,
that man is unable to find out the work that has been done under the sun. For
though a man labours to seek, yet he does not find it. And even though a wise
one claims to know, he is unable to find it. 
Eccl
9:1  For all this I took to heart, even
to search out all this: that the righteous and the wise and their deeds are in
the hand of Elohim. No man knows whether love or hatred awaits him. 
Eccl
9:2  It is the same for all: One event to
the righteous and to the wrong; to the good, and to the clean, and to the
unclean; and to the one slaughtering and to the one not slaughtering. As is the
good one, so is the sinner; the one swearing as the one fearing an oath. 
Eccl
9:3  This is an evil in all that is done
under the sun: there is one event to all. Truly the hearts of the sons of men
are filled with evil, and madness is in their hearts while they live, and then –
to the dead! 
Eccl
9:4  But for him who is joined to all the
living there is trust, for a living dog is better than a dead lion. 
Eccl
9:5  For the living know that they shall
die, but the dead know naught, nor do they have any more reward, for their
remembrance is forgotten. 
Eccl
9:6  Also their love, and their hatred,
and their envy have now perished; and they no longer have a share in all that
is done under the sun. 
Eccl
9:7  Go, eat your bread with joy, and
drink your wine with a glad heart; for Elohim has already approved your works. 
Eccl
9:8  Let your garments be white at all
times, and let your head lack no oil. 
Eccl
9:9  See life with the wife whom you love
all the days of your futile life which He has given you under the sun, all your
days of futility. For that is your share in life, and in your toil which you
have laboured under the sun. 
Eccl
9:10  All that your hand finds to do, do
it with your might; for there is no work or planning or knowledge or wisdom in
the grave where you are going. 
Eccl
9:11  I again saw under the sun that the
race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the mighty, nor even bread to the
wise, nor even riches to men of understanding, nor even favour to men of
knowledge – for time and chance meets with them all. 
Eccl
9:12  For even man does not know his
time. Like fish taken in an evil net, and like birds caught in a snare, so the
sons of men are snared in an evil time, when it come down on them suddenly. 
Eccl
9:13  Also this I saw as wisdom under the
sun, and it is great to me: 
Eccl
9:14  A little city, and few men in it,
and a great sovereign came against it, and besieged it, and built huge
siege-works against it. 
Eccl
9:15  And there was found in it a poor
wise man, and by his wisdom he delivered the city, yet no one remembered that
poor man. 
Eccl
9:16  And I said, “Wisdom is better than
might. But the wisdom of the poor man is despised, and his words are not heard.”

Eccl
9:17  The words of the wise, spoken
calmly, should be heard rather than the shout of a ruler of fools. 
Eccl
9:18  Wisdom is better than weapons of
conflict, but one sinner destroys much good. 
Eccl
10:1  Dead flies make the perfumer’s
ointment stink, ferment; a little folly outweighs wisdom, esteem. 
Eccl
10:2  A wise man’s heart is at his right
hand, but a fool’s heart at his left. 
Eccl
10:3  And also, when a fool walks along
the way, his heart fails, and he shows everyone that he is a fool. 
Eccl
10:4  If the spirit of the ruler rises
against you, do not leave your post, for calmness lays to rest great faults. 
Eccl
10:5  There is an evil I have seen under
the sun, as a mistake coming from the ruler: 
Eccl
10:6  Folly is set in many high positions, while the rich sit in a
humble place. 
Eccl
10:7  I have seen servants on horses –
and rulers walking on the ground like servants. 
Eccl
10:8  He who digs a pit falls into it,
and whoever breaks through a wall is bitten by a snake. 
Eccl
10:9  He who quarries stones is hurt by
them. He who splits wood is endangered by it.
Eccl
10:10  If an iron tool is blunt, and one
does not sharpen the edge, then he needs more strength, and wisdom is
advantageous to make right. 
Eccl
10:11  If the snake bites without
enchantment, then ‘the master of the tongue’ is no better! 
Eccl
10:12  Words of a wise man’s mouth show
favour, but the lips of a fool swallow him up;
Eccl
10:13  the beginning of the words of his
mouth is foolishness, and the end of his talk is wicked madness. 
Eccl
10:14  And a fool increases words; a man
knows not what shall come to be; and who declares to him what shall be after
him? 
Eccl
10:15  The labour of fools wearies them,
because not one knows how to go to the city!
Eccl
10:16  Woe to you, O land, when your
sovereign is a youth, and your rulers feast in the morning! 
Eccl
10:17  Blessed are you, O land, when your
sovereign is the son of nobles, and your rulers feast in due season – for
strength and not for drunkenness! 
Eccl
10:18  Because of laziness the framework
tumbles, and through idleness of hands the house leaks. 
Eccl
10:19  A feast is made for laughter, and
wine gladdens life; and the silver answers all. 
Eccl
10:20  Do not curse the sovereign, even
in your thought; do not curse the rich, even in your bedroom; for a bird of the
heavens conveys the voice, and a bird in flight makes the matter known. 
Eccl
11:1  Send out your bread on the face of
the waters, for after many days you shall find it. 
Eccl
11:2  Give a portion to seven, and also
to eight, for you do not know what evil might be on the earth. 
Eccl
11:3  If the clouds are filled with rain,
they empty themselves upon the earth. And if a tree falls to the south or the
north, in the place where the tree falls, there it is. 
Eccl
11:4  He who watches the wind does not
sow, and he who looks at the clouds does not reap. 
Eccl
11:5  As you do not know what is the way
of the wind, or how the bones grow in the womb of her who is with child, so you
do not know the works of Elohim who makes all.
Eccl
11:6  Sow your seed in the morning, and
until evening do not let your hand rest; since you do not know which prosper,
this or that, or whether both alike are good. 
Eccl
11:7  Sweet also is the light, and good
for the eyes to see the sun; 
Eccl
11:8  But if a man lives many years, let
him rejoice in them all. But let him remember the days of darkness, for they
are many. All that is coming is futility. 
Eccl
11:9  Rejoice, O young man, in your
youth, and let your heart gladden you in the days of your youth. And walk in
the ways of your heart, and in the sight of your eyes, but know that for all
these Elohim brings you into right-ruling. 
Eccl
11:10  Therefore remove vexation from
your heart, and put away evil from your flesh, for youth and dawn of life are
futility. 
Eccl
12:1  Remember also your Creator in the
days of your youth, before the evil days come, and the years draw near when you
say, “I have no pleasure in them”: 
Eccl
12:2  Before the sun and the light, the
moon and the stars, are darkened, and the clouds return after the rain; 
Eccl
12:3  in the day when the guards of the
house tremble, and the strong men shall bow down; when the grinders shall cease
because they are few, and those that look through the windows shall become dim;

Eccl
12:4  and the doors shall be shut in the
streets, and the sound of grinding is low; and one rises up at the sound of a
bird, and all the daughters of song are bowed down; 
Eccl
12:5  furthermore, they are afraid of
what is high, and of low places in the way; and the almond tree blossoms, and
the grasshopper becomes a burden, and desire perishes. For man is going to his
everlasting home, and the mourners shall go about the streets. 
Eccl
12:6  Remember
Him before the silver cord is loosed, or the golden bowl is broken, or the
jar shattered at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the well, 
Eccl
12:7  and the dust returns to the earth
as it was, and the spirit returns to Elohim who gave it. 
Eccl
12:8  “Futility! Futility!” said the
Qoheleth, “All is futile.” 
Eccl
12:9  And besides being wise, Qoheleth
also taught the people knowledge, and he listened and sought out – set in order
many proverbs. 
Eccl
12:10  Qoheleth sought to find out words
of delight, and words of truth, rightly written. 
Eccl
12:11  The words of the wise are like
goads, and as nails driven by the masters of collections – they were given by
one Shepherd. 
Eccl
12:12  And besides these, my son, be
warned – the making of many books has no end, and much study is a wearying of
the flesh. 
Eccl
12:13  Let us hear the conclusion of the
entire matter: Fear Elohim and guard His commands, for this applies to all mankind! 
Eccl
12:14  For Elohim shall bring every work
into right-ruling, including all that is hidden, whether good or whether evil.
