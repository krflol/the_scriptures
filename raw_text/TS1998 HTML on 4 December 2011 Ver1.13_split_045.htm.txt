Ḥaḇaqquq/Habakkuk
Hab
1:1  The message which the prophet Ḥaḇaqquq
saw. 
Hab
1:2  O יהוה, till
when shall I cry, and You not hear? I cry to You, “Violence!” and You do not
save. 
Hab
1:3  Why do You show me wickedness, and
cause me to see perversity? For ruin and violence are before me. And there is
strife, and contention arises. 
Hab
1:4  Therefore the Torah ceases, and
right-ruling never goes forth. For the wrong hem in the righteous, so that
right-ruling comes out twisted. 
Hab
1:5  “Look among the nations and see, and
be amazed, be amazed! For a work is being wrought in your days which you would
not believe if it were told. 
Hab
1:6  “See, I am raising up the Chaldeans,
a bitter and hasty nation, who is going through the breadth of the earth, to
possess dwelling places that are not theirs. 
Hab
1:7  “They are frightening and fearsome,
their right-ruling and their exaltation proceed from themselves. 
Hab
1:8  “Their horses shall be swifter than
leopards, and more fierce than evening wolves. And their horsemen shall charge
ahead, and their horsemen come from afar. They fly as the eagle, rushing to
eat. 
Hab
1:9  “All of them come for violence, the
direction of their faces is like the east wind, and they gather captives like
sand. 
Hab
1:10  “And they scoff at sovereigns, and
princes are a laughing matter to them. They laugh at every stronghold, for they
pile up earth and seize it. 
Hab
1:11  “Then shall he pass on as a wind,
and transgress and be guilty, and ascribe this power to his mighty one.” 
Hab
1:12  Are You not from everlasting, O יהוה
my Elohim, my Set-apart One? You do not die! O יהוה,
You have appointed them for right-ruling, O Rock, You have established them for
reproof. 
Hab
1:13  You,
whose eyes are too clean to see evil, You are not able to look on wrong. Why do
You look on those who act treacherously – keep silent when the wrong devours
one more righteous than he? 
Hab
1:14  And would You make men like fish of
the sea, like creeping creatures that have no ruler over them? 
Hab
1:15  The
wicked foe has pulled all of them up with a hook, caught them in his net,
and gathers them in his dragnet. Therefore he rejoices and exults. 
Hab
1:16  Therefore he offers to his net, and
burns incense to his dragnet, for by them is his portion fat and his food is
rich. 
Hab
1:17  Is he therefore to keep on emptying
his net, and slaying nations without sparing? 
Hab
2:1  I stand at my watch, and station
myself on the watch-tower, and wait to see what He says to me, and what to
answer when I am reproved. 
Hab
2:2  And יהוה
answered me and said, “Write the vision and inscribe it on tablets, so that he
who reads it runs. 
Hab
2:3  “For the vision is yet for an
appointed time, and it speaks of the end, and does not lie. If it lingers, wait
for it, for it shall certainly come, it shall not delay. 
Hab
2:4  “See, he whose being is not upright
in him is puffed up. But the righteous one lives by his steadfastness. 
Hab
2:5  “And also, because wine betrays him,
a man is proud, and he does not stay at home. Because he enlarges his appetite
as the grave, and he is like death, and is not satisfied, and gathers to
himself all nations and heaps up for himself all peoples. 
Hab
2:6  “Shall not all these lift up a
proverb against him, and a mocking riddle against him, and say, ‘Woe to him who
increases what is not his! Till when is he to load on himself many pledges’? 
Hab
2:7  “Do not your creditors rise up
suddenly? And those who make you tremble wake up and you be plunder for them? 
Hab
2:8  “Because you have plundered many
nations, all the remnant of the people shall plunder you, because of men’s
blood, and doing violence to the land, to the city, and to all who dwell in it.

Hab
2:9  “Woe to him who is getting evil gain
for his house, in order to set his nest on high, to escape the clutches of
evil! 
Hab
2:10  “You have counselled shame for your
house, to cut off many peoples, and your being is sinning. 
Hab
2:11  “For a stone from the wall cries
out, and a beam from the timbers answers it. 
Hab
2:12  “Woe to him who builds a town by
blood, and establishes a city by unrighteousness! 
Hab
2:13  “See, it is not from יהוה
of hosts that peoples labour only for fire, and nations weary themselves for
naught, 
Hab
2:14  for the earth shall be filled with
the knowledge of the esteem of יהוה, as the waters
cover the sea!
Hab
2:15  “Woe to him who gives drink to his
neighbour, pouring out your wineskin, and also making him drunk – in order to
look on their nakedness! 
Hab
2:16  “You shall be filled with shame
instead of esteem. Drink, you too, and be exposed as uncircumcised! The cup of
the right hand of יהוה shall come around to you, and great
shame upon your esteem. 
Hab
2:17  “For the violence done to Leḇanon
is to overwhelm you – and the ravaging of beasts by which you made them afraid –
because of men’s blood and the violence to the land, to the city and of all who
dwell in it.
Hab
2:18  “Of what use shall a carved image
be? For its maker has carved it: a moulded image and teacher of falsehood! For
the maker trusts what he has made: to make dumb idols! 
Hab
2:19  “Woe to him who says to wood, ‘Awake!’
to silent stone, ‘Arise!’ Is it a teacher? See, it is overlaid with gold and
silver, and there is no spirit at all inside it. 
Hab
2:20  “But יהוה
is in His set-apart Hĕḵal. Let all the earth be silent before Him.” 
Hab
3:1  A prayer of Ḥaḇaqquq the
prophet, on Shiḡionoth. 
Hab
3:2  O יהוה, I
have heard your report, I was afraid. O יהוה, renew
Your work in the midst of the years! Make it known in the midst of the years.
In wrath remember compassion.
Hab
3:3  Eloah comes from Tĕman, And the
Set-apart One from Mount Paran. Selah. His splendour shall cover the heavens,
And His praise shall fill the earth.
Hab
3:4  And the brightness is as the light,
He has rays from His hand, And there His power is hidden.
Hab
3:5  Before Him goes pestilence, And a
burning flame goes forth at His feet.
Hab
3:6  He shall stand and measure the
earth. He shall look and shake the nations. And the ancient mountains are
shattered, The age-old hills shall bow. His ways are everlasting.
Hab
3:7  I saw the tents of Kushan under
sorrow, The curtains of the land of Miḏyan tremble.
Hab
3:8  Shall יהוה
burn against the rivers? Is Your displeasure against the rivers, Is Your wrath
against the sea, That You ride on Your horses, Your chariots of deliverance?
Hab
3:9  You uncover Your bow, The oaths of
the rod of the Word. Selah. You cut through the earth with rivers.
Hab
3:10  The mountains shall see You, they
tremble. The storm of water shall pass over. The deep shall give forth its
voice, It shall lift up its hands.
Hab
3:11  Sun, moon shall stand still in
their places. Like light Your arrows fly, Like lightning is Your glittering
spear.
Hab
3:12  You step through the earth in rage,
You thresh the gentiles in wrath.
Hab
3:13  You shall go forth to save Your
people, To save Your Anointed. You shall smite the Head from the house of the
wrong, By laying bare from foundation to neck. Selah.
Hab
3:14  You shall pierce with his own
arrows The head of his leaders. They stormed along to scatter me, Rejoicing as
if to devour the poor in secret.
Hab
3:15  You shall tread the sea with Your
horses, The foaming of many waters.
Hab
3:16  I heard, and my body trembled, My
lips quivered at the sound, Rottenness came into my bones. And I trembled
within myself, That I might rest for the day of distress, To come upon the
people who would attack us.
Hab
3:17  Though the fig tree does not
blossom, And there is no fruit on the vine, The yield of the olive has failed,
And the fields brought forth no food, The flock has been cut off from the fold,
And there is no herd in the stalls,
Hab
3:18  Yet I exult in יהוה,
I rejoice in the Elohim of my deliverance.
Hab
3:19  To the chief singer with my
stringed instruments.
