Deḇarim/Deuteronomy
Deut
1:1  These are the words which Mosheh
spoke to all Yisra’ĕl beyond the Yardĕn in the wilderness, in the
desert plain opposite Suph, between Paran and Tophel, and Laḇan, and Ḥatsĕroth,
and Di Zahaḇ, 
Deut
1:2  eleven days’ journey from Ḥorĕḇ by way of Mount Sĕ‛ir
to Qaḏĕsh Barnĕa. 
Deut
1:3  And it came to be in the fortieth
year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Mosheh spoke
to the children of Yisra’ĕl according to all that יהוה
had commanded him concerning them,
Deut
1:4  after he had smitten Siḥon
sovereign of the Amorites, who dwelt in Ḥeshbon, and Oḡ sovereign
of Bashan, who dwelt at Ashtaroth in Eḏre‛i. 
Deut
1:5  Beyond the Yardĕn, in the land
of Mo’aḇ, Mosheh undertook to declair this Torah, saying, 
Deut
1:6  “ יהוה our
Elohim spoke to us in Ḥorĕḇ, saying, ‘You have dwelt long
enough at this mountain. 
Deut
1:7  ‘Turn and set out on your way, and
go into the mountains of the Amorites, and to all the neighbouring places in
the desert plain, in the mountains and in the low country, and in the Negeḇ
and on the seacoast, to the land of the Kena‛anites and to Leḇanon,
as far as the great river, the River Euphrates. 
Deut
1:8  ‘See, I have set the land before
you. Go in and possess the land which יהוה swore to
your fathers, to Aḇraham, to Yitsḥaq, and to Ya‛aqoḇ,
to give to them and their seed after them.’ 
Deut
1:9  “And I spoke to you at that time,
saying, ‘I am unable to bear you by myself. 
Deut
1:10  ‘ יהוה your
Elohim has increased you, and see, you are today as numerous as the stars of
the heavens. 
Deut
1:11  ‘ יהוה
Elohim of your fathers is going to add to you a thousand times more than you
are, and bless you as He has spoken to you! 
Deut
1:12  ‘How do I bear your pressure and
your burden and your strife, by myself? 
Deut
1:13  ‘Choose men, wise and
understanding, and known to your tribes, and let me appoint them as your heads.’

Deut
1:14  “And you answered me and said, ‘The
word which you have spoken to us to do is good.’ 
Deut
1:15  “And I took the heads of your
tribes, wise men and known, and made them heads over you, leaders of thousands,
and leaders of hundreds, and leaders of fifties, and leaders of tens, and
officers for your tribes. 
Deut
1:16  “And I commanded your judges at
that time, saying, ‘When hearing between your brothers, judge righteously
between a man and his brother or the stranger who is with him. 
Deut
1:17  ‘Do not show partiality in
right-ruling, hear the small as well as the great. Do not be afraid of anyone’s
face, for the right-ruling belongs to Elohim. And the case which is too hard
for you, bring it to me, and I shall hear it.’ 
Deut
1:18  “And I commanded you at that time
all the words which you should do. 
Deut
1:19  “Then we set out from Ḥorĕḇ,
and went through all that great and awesome wilderness which you saw on the way
to the mountains of the Amorites, as יהוה our Elohim
had commanded us. And we came to Qaḏĕsh Barnĕa. 
Deut
1:20  “And I said to you, ‘You have come
to the mountains of the Amorites, which יהוה our Elohim
is giving us. 
Deut
1:21  ‘See, יהוה
your Elohim has set the land before you. Go up and possess it, as יהוה
Elohim of your fathers has spoken to you. Do not fear, nor be discouraged.’ 
Deut
1:22  “And all of you came near to me and
said, ‘Let us send men before us, and let them search out the land for us, and
bring back word to us of the way by which we should go up, and of the cities
into which we would come.’ 
Deut
1:23  “And the matter was good in my
eyes, so I took twelve of your men, one man from each tribe. 
Deut
1:24  “And they turned and went up into
the mountains, and came to the wadi Eshkol, and spied it out. 
Deut
1:25  “And they took some of the fruit of
the land in their hands and brought it down to us. And they brought back word
to us, saying, ‘The land which יהוה our Elohim is
giving us is good.’
Deut
1:26  “But you would not go up and
rebelled against the mouth of יהוה your Elohim, 
Deut
1:27  and grumbled in your tents, and
said, ‘Because יהוה was hating us, He has brought us
out of the land of Mitsrayim to give us into the hand of the Amorites, to
destroy us. 
Deut
1:28  ‘Where are we going to? Our
brothers have made our hearts melt, saying, “The people are greater and taller
than we, the cities are great and walled up to the heavens, and we saw the sons
of the Anaqim there too.” ’
Deut
1:29  “Then I said to you, ‘Have no dread
or fear of them. 
Deut
1:30  ‘ יהוה your
Elohim, who is going before you, He does fight for you, according to all He did
for you in Mitsrayim before your eyes, 
Deut
1:31  and in the wilderness, where you
saw how יהוה your Elohim has borne you, as a man bears
his son, in all the way that you went until you came to this place.’ 
Deut
1:32  “Yet in this matter you are putting
no trust in יהוה your Elohim, 
Deut
1:33  who is going before you in the way
to seek out a place for you to pitch your tents, to show you the way you should
go, in fire by night and in a cloud by day. 
Deut
1:34  “And יהוה
heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and took an oath, saying, 
Deut
1:35  ‘Not one of these men of this evil
generation shall see that good land of which I swore to give to your fathers, 
Deut
1:36  except Kalĕḇ son of
Yephunneh. He shall see it, and to him and his children I give the land on
which he walked, because he followed יהוה completely.’ 
Deut
1:37  “And יהוה
was enraged with me for your sakes, saying, ‘You do not go in there, either. 
Deut
1:38  ‘Yehoshua the son of Nun, who
stands before you, he shall go in there. Strengthen him, for he shall cause
Yisra’ĕl to inherit. 
Deut
1:39  ‘And your little ones and your
children, who you say are for a prey, who today have no knowledge of good and
evil, they are going in there. And to them I give it, and they are to possess
it. 
Deut
1:40  ‘But you, turn and take your
journey into the wilderness by the Way of the Sea of Reeds.’ 
Deut
1:41  “Then you answered and said to me, ‘We
have sinned against יהוה. We ourselves are going up,
and we shall fight, as יהוה our Elohim commanded us.’
And when each one of you had girded on his battle gear, you were ready to go up
into the mountain. 
Deut
1:42  “And יהוה
said to me, ‘Say to them, “Do not go up nor fight, for I am not in your midst,
lest you be smitten before your enemies.” ’ 
Deut
1:43  “So I spoke to you, but you would
not listen and rebelled against the mouth of יהוה, and
acted proudly, and went up into the mountain. 
Deut
1:44  “Then the Amorites who dwelt in
that mountain came out against you and chased you as bees do, and drove you
back from Sĕ‛ir to Ḥormah. 
Deut
1:45  “And you returned and wept before יהוה,
but יהוה would not listen to your voice nor give ear to
you. 
Deut
1:46  “So you dwelt in Qaḏĕsh
many days, according to the days that you dwelt. 
Deut
2:1  “Then we turned and set out into the
wilderness, the way of the Sea of Reeds, as יהוה spoke
to me, and we went round Mount Sĕ‛ir, many days. 
Deut
2:2  “And יהוה
spoke to me, saying, 
Deut
2:3  ‘You have gone around this mountain
long enough, turn northward. 
Deut
2:4  ‘And command the people, saying, “You
are about to pass over into the border of your brothers, the descendants of Ĕsaw,
who live in Sĕ‛ir, and they are afraid of you. So be on your guard. 
Deut
2:5  “Do not strive with them, for I do
not give you any of their land, no, not so much as one footstep, because I have
given Mount Sĕ‛ir to Ĕsaw as a possession. 
Deut
2:6  “What food you buy from them with
silver you shall eat. And also, what water you buy from them with silver you
shall drink. 
Deut
2:7  “For יהוה
your Elohim has blessed you in all the work of your hand. He has known your
wandering through this great wilderness. These forty years יהוה
your Elohim has been with you, you have not lacked any matter.” ’ 
Deut
2:8  “And when we passed beyond our
brothers, the descendants of Ĕsaw who dwell in Sĕ‛ir, away from
the way of the desert plain, away from Ĕylath and Etsyon Geḇer, we
turned and passed over by way of the Wilderness of Mo’aḇ. 
Deut
2:9  “And יהוה
said to me, ‘Do not distress Mo’aḇ, nor stir yourself up against them in
battle, for I do not give you any of their land as a possession, because I have
given Ar to the descendants of Lot as a possession.’ ”
Deut
2:10  (The Ĕmites had dwelt there
formerly, a people as great and numerous and tall as the Anaqim. 
Deut
2:11  They were also reckoned as Repha’ites,
like the Anaqim, but the Mo’aḇites call them Ĕmites. 
Deut
2:12  And the Ḥorites formerly
dwelt in Sĕ‛ir, but the descendants of Ĕsaw dispossessed them
and destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their place, as Yisra’ĕl
did to the land of their possession which יהוה gave
them). 
Deut
2:13  “ ‘Now rise up, and pass over the
wadi Zereḏ.’ So we passed over the wadi Zereḏ. 
Deut
2:14  “And the time we took to come from
Qaḏĕsh Barnĕa until we passed over the wadi Zereḏ was
thirty-eight years, until all the generation of the men of battle was consumed
from the midst of the camp, as יהוה had sworn to them. 
Deut
2:15  “And also, the hand of יהוה
was against them, to destroy them from the midst of the camp until they were
consumed. 
Deut
2:16  “And it came to be, when all the
men of battle had finally perished from among the people, 
Deut
2:17  that יהוה
spoke to me, saying, 
Deut
2:18  ‘This day you are to pass over at
Ar, the boundary of Mo’aḇ. 
Deut
2:19  ‘And when you come near the
children of Ammon, do not distress them nor stir yourself up against them, for
I do not give you any of the land of the children of Ammon as a possession,
because I have given it to the descendants of Lot as a possession.’ 
Deut
2:20  (That was also reckoned as a land
of Repha’ites. Repha’ites formerly dwelt there. But the Ammonites call them
Zamzummim, 
Deut
2:21  a people as great and numerous and
tall as the Anaqim. But יהוה destroyed them before
them, and they dispossessed them and dwelt in their place, 
Deut
2:22  as He had done for the descendants
of Ĕsaw, who dwelt in Sĕ‛ir, when He destroyed the Ḥorites
from before them. They dispossessed them and dwelt in their place, even to this
day. 
Deut
2:23  And the Awwim who dwelt in villages
as far as Azzah, the Kaphtorim who came from Kaphtor, destroyed them and dwelt
in their place). 
Deut
2:24  ‘Arise, set out and pass over the
wadi Arnon. See, I have given into your hand Siḥon the Amorite, sovereign
of Ḥeshbon, and his land. Begin to possess it, and stir up yourself
against him in battle. 
Deut
2:25  ‘This day I begin to put the dread
and fear of you upon the peoples under all the heavens, who, when they hear the
report of you, shall tremble and shake because of you.’ 
Deut
2:26  “Then I sent messengers from the
Wilderness of Qeḏĕmoth to Siḥon sovereign of Ḥeshbon,
with words of peace, saying, 
Deut
2:27  ‘Let me pass over through your land
on the highway. I shall go on the highway and turn neither to the right nor to
the left. 
Deut
2:28  ‘What food you sell me for silver I
shall eat, and what water you give me for silver I shall drink. Only let me
pass over on foot, 
Deut
2:29  as the descendants of Ĕsaw who
dwell in Sĕ‛ir and the Mo’aḇites who dwell in Ar did for me –
until I pass over the Yardĕn to the land יהוה our
Elohim is giving us.’ 
Deut
2:30  “But Siḥon sovereign of Ḥeshbon
would not let us pass over, for יהוה your Elohim
hardened his spirit and strengthened his heart, to give him into your hand, as
it is this day. 
Deut
2:31  “And יהוה
said to me, ‘See, I have begun to give Siḥon and his land over to you.
Begin to possess – in order to possess his land.’ 
Deut
2:32  “And Siḥon and all his people
came out against us to fight at Yahats, 
Deut
2:33  and יהוה
our Elohim gave him over to us, so we smote him, and his sons, and all his
people. 
Deut
2:34  “And we took all his cities at that
time, and we put the men, women, and little ones of every city under the ban,
we left none remaining. 
Deut
2:35  “Only the livestock we took as
plunder for ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we captured. 
Deut
2:36  “From Aro‛ĕr, which is
on the edge of the wadi Arnon, and the city that is by the wadi, as far as Gil‛aḏ,
there was not one city too high for us. יהוה our Elohim
gave all to us. 
Deut
2:37  “Only you did not go near the land
of the children of Ammon – anywhere along the wadi Yabboq, or to the cities of
the mountains, or wherever יהוה our Elohim had
forbidden us. 
Deut
3:1  “Then we turned and went up the way
to Bashan. And Oḡ sovereign of Bashan came out against us, he and all his
people, to battle at Eḏre‛i. 
Deut
3:2  “And יהוה
said to me, ‘Do not fear him, for I have given him and all his people and his
land into your hand. And you shall do to him as you did to Siḥon
sovereign of the Amorites, who dwelt at Ḥeshbon.’ 
Deut
3:3  “So יהוה our
Elohim also gave into our hands Oḡ sovereign of Bashan, with all his
people, and we smote him until he had no survivors remaining. 
Deut
3:4  “And we captured all his cities at
that time. There was not a city which we did not take from them: sixty cities,
all the district of Argoḇ, the reign of Oḡ in Bashan. 
Deut
3:5  “All these cities were fenced with
high walls, gates and bars, besides a great many unwalled towns. 
Deut
3:6  “And we put them under the ban, as
we did to Siḥon sovereign of Ḥeshbon, putting the men, the women,
and the children of every city under the ban. 
Deut
3:7  “But all the livestock and the spoil
of the cities we took as booty for ourselves. 
Deut
3:8  “And at that time we took the land,
from the hand of the two sovereigns of the Amorites, that was beyond the Yardĕn,
from the wadi Arnon to Mount Ḥermon 
Deut
3:9  “(Tsiḏonians call Ḥermon,
Siryon – and the Amorites call it Senir), 
Deut
3:10  all the cities of the plain, all
Gil‛aḏ, and all Bashan, as far as Salḵah and Eḏre‛i,
cities of the reign of Oḡ in Bashan. 
Deut
3:11  “For only Oḡ sovereign of
Bashan was left of the remnant of the Repha’ites. See, his bedstead was an iron
bedstead. Is it not in Rabbah of the children of Ammon? Nine cubits is its
length and four cubits its width, according to the cubit of a man. 
Deut
3:12  “And this land, which we possessed
at that time, from Aro‛ĕr, which is by the wadi Arnon, and half the
mountains of Gil‛aḏ and its cities, I gave to the Re’uḇĕnites
and the Gaḏites. 
Deut
3:13  “And the rest of Gil‛aḏ,
and all Bashan, the reign of Oḡ, I gave to half the tribe of Menashsheh –
all the district of Argoḇ, with all Bashan, called the land of the Repha’ites.

Deut
3:14  “Ya‛ir son of Menashsheh had
taken all the district of Argoḇ, as far as the border of the Geshurites
and the Ma‛aḵathites, and called them after his own name: the
Bashan of Hawoth Ya‛ir, to this day. 
Deut
3:15  “And to Maḵir I gave Gil‛aḏ.

Deut
3:16  “And to the Re’uḇĕnites
and the Gaḏites I gave from Gil‛aḏ as far as the wadi Arnon,
the middle of the wadi as the border, as far as the wadi Yabboq, the border of
the children of Ammon,
Deut
3:17  and the desert plain, with the Yardĕn
as the border, from Kinnereth as far as the Sea of the Araḇah, the Salt
Sea, below the slopes of Pisgah on the east. 
Deut
3:18  “And I commanded you at that time,
saying, ‘ יהוה your Elohim has given you this land to
possess. All you sons of might, pass over armed before your brothers, the
children of Yisra’ĕl. 
Deut
3:19  ‘But let your wives and your little
ones, and your livestock – I know that you have much livestock – stay in your
cities which I have given you, 
Deut
3:20  until יהוה
has given rest to your brothers as to you, and they also possess the land which
יהוה your Elohim is giving them beyond the Yardĕn.
Then you shall return, each man to his possession which I have given you.’ 
Deut
3:21  “And I commanded Yehoshua at that
time, saying, ‘Your eyes have seen all that יהוה your
Elohim has done to these two sovereigns. יהוה does the
same to all the reigns which you are passing over. 
Deut
3:22  ‘Do not fear them, for יהוה
your Elohim Himself fights for you.’ 
Deut
3:23  “And I pleaded with יהוה
at that time, saying, 
Deut
3:24  ‘O Master יהוה,
You have begun to show Your servant Your greatness and Your strong hand, for
who is a mighty one in the heavens or on earth who does according to Your works
and according to Your might? 
Deut
3:25  ‘I pray, let me pass over and see
the good land beyond the Yardĕn, this good hill country, and Leḇanon.’

Deut
3:26  “But יהוה
was enraged with me, for your sake, and would not listen to me, and יהוה
said to me, ‘Enough of that! Speak no more to Me about this matter. 
Deut
3:27  ‘Go up to the top of Pisgah, and
lift up your eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and
look with your eyes, for you do not pass over this Yardĕn. 
Deut
3:28  ‘But charge Yehoshua, and
strengthen him and make him brave, for he shall pass over before this people
and causes them to inherit the land which you see.’ 
Deut
3:29  “And we dwelt in the valley
opposite Bĕyth Pe‛or. 
Deut
4:1  “And now, O Yisra’ĕl, listen to
the laws and the right-rulings which I am teaching you to do, so that you live,
and shall go in and possess the land which יהוה Elohim
of your fathers is giving you. 
Deut
4:2  “Do not add to the Word which I
command you, and do not take away from it, so as to guard the commands of יהוה
your Elohim which I am commanding you.
Deut
4:3  “Your eyes have seen what יהוה
did at Ba‛al Pe‛or, for יהוה your Elohim
has destroyed from your midst all the men who followed Ba‛al Pe‛or.

Deut
4:4  “But you who are clinging to יהוה
your Elohim are alive today, every one of you. 
Deut
4:5  “See, I have taught you laws and
right-rulings, as יהוה my Elohim commanded me, to do
thus in the land which you go to possess. 
Deut
4:6  “And you shall guard and do them,
for this is your wisdom and your understanding before the eyes of the peoples
who hear all these laws, and they shall say, ‘Only a wise and understanding
people is this great nation!’
Deut
4:7  “For what great nation is there
which has Elohim so near to it, as יהוה our Elohim is
to us, whenever we call on Him? 
Deut
4:8  “And what great nation is there that
has such laws and righteous right-rulings like all this Torah which I set
before you this day? 
Deut
4:9  “Only, guard yourself, and guard
your life diligently, lest you forget the Words your eyes have seen, and lest
they turn aside from your heart all the days of your life. And you shall make
them known to your children and your grandchildren. 
Deut
4:10  “The day when you stood before יהוה
your Elohim in Ḥorĕḇ, יהוה said to me,
‘Assemble the people to Me and I make them hear My Words, so that they learn to
fear Me all the days they live on the earth and teach them to their children.’ 
Deut
4:11  “And you came near and stood at the
foot of the mountain, and the mountain burned with fire to the heart of the
heavens – darkness, cloud, and thick darkness. 
Deut
4:12  “And יהוה
spoke to you out of the midst of the fire. You heard a voice of words, but saw
no form, you only heard a voice. 
Deut
4:13  “And He made known to you His
covenant which He commanded you to do, the Ten Words, and He wrote them on two
tablets of stone. 
Deut
4:14  “And יהוה
commanded me at that time to teach you laws and right-rulings, for you to do
them in the land which you pass over to possess. 
Deut
4:15  “Therefore, diligently guard
yourselves, for you saw no form when יהוה spoke to you
at Ḥorĕḇ out of the midst of the fire, 
Deut
4:16  lest you should do corruptly and
shall make for yourselves a carved image in the form of any figure – the
likeness of male or female, 
Deut
4:17  the likeness of any beast that is
on the earth or the likeness of any winged bird that flies in the heavens, 
Deut
4:18  the likeness of any creature that
creeps on the ground or the likeness of any fish that is in the water under the
earth; 
Deut
4:19  and lest you lift up your eyes to
the heavens, and shall see the sun, and the moon, and the stars – all the host
of the heavens – and you be drawn away into bowing down to them and serving
them, which יהוה your Elohim has allotted to all the
peoples under all the heavens. 
Deut
4:20  “But יהוה
has taken you and brought you out of the iron furnace, out of Mitsrayim, to be
His people, an inheritance, as it is today. 
Deut
4:21  “And יהוה
was enraged with me because of your words, and swore that I would not pass over
the Yardĕn, and that I would not enter the good land which יהוה
your Elohim is giving you as an inheritance. 
Deut
4:22  “For I am to die in this land, I am
not passing over the Yardĕn, but you are passing over, and shall possess
that good land. 
Deut
4:23  “Guard yourselves, lest you forget
the covenant of יהוה your Elohim which He made with
you, and shall make for yourselves a carved image in the form of whatever יהוה
your Elohim has forbidden you. 
Deut
4:24  “For יהוה
your Elohim is a consuming fire, a jealous Ĕl. 
Deut
4:25  “When you bring forth children and
grandchildren, and shall grow old in the land, and shall do corruptly and make
a carved image in the form of whatever, and shall do what is evil in the eyes
of יהוה your Elohim to provoke Him, 
Deut
4:26  “I shall call the heavens and earth
to witness against you on that day, that you soon completely perish from the
land which you pass over the Yardĕn to possess – you do not prolong your
days in it but are completely destroyed. 
Deut
4:27  “And יהוה
shall scatter you among the peoples, and you shall be left few in number among
the gentiles where יהוה drives you. 
Deut
4:28  “And there you shall serve mighty
ones, the work of men’s hands, wood and stone, which neither see nor hear nor
eat nor smell. 
Deut
4:29  “But from there you shall seek יהוה
your Elohim, and shall find, when you search for Him with all your heart and
with all your being.
Deut
4:30  “In your distress, when all these
words shall come upon you in the latter days, then you shall return to יהוה
your Elohim and shall obey His voice. 
Deut
4:31  “For יהוה
your Elohim is a compassionate Ĕl, He does not forsake you, nor destroy
you, nor forget the covenant of your fathers which He swore to them. 
Deut
4:32  “For ask now of the days that are
past, which were before you, since the day that Elohim created man on the
earth, and ask from one end of the heavens to the other end of the heavens,
whether there has been a Word as great as this, or has been heard like it. 
Deut
4:33  “Has a people heard the voice of
Elohim speaking out of the midst of the fire, as you have heard, and live? 
Deut
4:34  “Or has Elohim tried to go and take
for Himself a nation from the midst of a nation by trials, and by signs, and by
wonders, and by battle, and by a strong hand and an outstretched arm, and by
great fearsome deeds, according to all that יהוה your
Elohim did for you in Mitsrayim before your eyes? 
Deut
4:35  “You have been shown it, to know
that יהוה Himself is Elohim; there is no one beside
Him. 
Deut
4:36  “From the heavens He let you hear
His voice, to instruct you, and on earth He showed you His great fire, and you
heard His words out of the midst of the fire. 
Deut
4:37  “And because He loved your fathers,
therefore He chose their seed after them, and brought you out of Mitsrayim with
His Presence, with His great power, 
Deut
4:38  to drive out from before you
nations greater and stronger than you, to bring you in, to give you their land
as an inheritance, as it is today. 
Deut
4:39  “And you shall know today, and
shall recall to your heart that יהוה Himself is Elohim
in the heavens above and on the earth beneath; there is none else. 
Deut
4:40  “And you shall guard His laws and
His commands which I command you today, so that it is well with you and with
your children after you, and so that you prolong your days on the soil which יהוה
your Elohim is giving you for all time.” 
Deut
4:41  Then Mosheh separated three cities
beyond the Yardĕn, toward the rising of the sun, 
Deut
4:42  for him who killed someone to flee
there, he who kills his neighbour unintentionally, without having hated him in
time past, and might flee to one of these cities and live: 
Deut

valley opposite Bĕyth Pe‛or, in the land of Siḥon sovereign of
the Amorites, who dwelt at Ḥeshbon, whom Mosheh and the children of Yisra’ĕl
had smitten after they came out of Mitsrayim.

land and the land of Oḡ sovereign of Bashan, two sovereigns of the
Amorites, who were beyond the Yardĕn, toward the rising of the sun,

awesome wilderness – fiery serpents and scorpions and thirst – where there was
no water, who brought water for you out of the flinty rock,

manna, which your fathers did not know, in order to humble you and to try you,

righteousness or the uprightness of your heart that you go in to possess their
land, but because of the wrong of these nations that יהוה

place, you have been rebellious against יהוה.

9:8  “Even in Ḥorĕḇ you
made יהוה wroth, so that יהוה
was enraged with you, to destroy you. 
Deut
9:9  “When I went up into the mountain to
receive the tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant which יהוה
made with you, then I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights. I did
not eat bread nor did I drink water. 
Deut
9:10  “Then יהוה
gave me the two tablets of stone written with the finger of Elohim, and on them
were all the Words which יהוה had spoken to you on the
mountain from the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly. 
Deut
9:11  “And it came to be, at the end of
forty days and forty nights, that יהוה gave me the two
tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant. 
Deut
9:12  “Then יהוה
said to me, ‘Arise, go down quickly from here, for your people whom you brought
out of Mitsrayim have acted corruptly. They have quickly turned aside from the
way which I commanded them, they have made themselves a moulded image.’ 
Deut
9:13  “And יהוה
spoke to me, saying, ‘I have seen this people, and look, they are a
stiff-necked people. 
Deut
9:14  ‘Leave Me alone, so that I destroy
them and blot out their name from under the heavens, and make of you a nation
stronger and greater than they.’ 
Deut
9:15  “So I turned and came down from the
mountain, and the mountain burned with fire. And the two tablets of the
covenant were in my two hands. 
Deut
9:16  “And I looked and saw that you had
sinned against יהוה your Elohim, and had made for
yourselves a moulded calf! You had quickly turned aside from the way which יהוה
had commanded you. 
Deut
9:17  “And I took the two tablets and
threw them out of my two hands and broke them before your eyes, 
Deut
9:18  “and I fell down before יהוה,
as at the first, forty days and forty nights. I did not eat bread and I did not
drink water, because of all your sins which you committed in doing evil in the
eyes of יהוה, to provoke Him. 
Deut
9:19  “For I was afraid of the
displeasure and rage with which יהוה was wroth with you,
to destroy you. But יהוה listened to me that time once
more. 
Deut
9:20  “And יהוה
was very enraged with Aharon, to destroy him, so I prayed for Aharon at that
time also. 
Deut
9:21  “And I took your sin, the calf
which you had made, and burned it with fire and crushed it and ground it very
small, until it was as fine as dust. And I threw its dust into the stream that
came down from the mountain. 
Deut
9:22  “And at Taḇ‛ĕrah

wroth. 
Deut
9:23  “And when יהוה
sent you from Qaḏĕsh Barnĕa, saying, ‘Go up and possess the
land which I have given you,’ then you rebelled against the mouth of יהוה
your Elohim, and you neither trusted Him nor listened to His voice. 
Deut
9:24  “You have been rebellious against יהוה
from the day that I knew you. 
Deut
9:25  “So I fell down before יהוה
the forty days and forty nights, for I fell down because יהוה
had said He would destroy you. 
Deut
9:26  “And I prayed to יהוה,
and said, ‘O Master יהוה, do not destroy Your people

brought out of Mitsrayim with a strong hand. 
Deut
9:27  ‘Remember Your servants, Aḇraham,
Yitsḥaq, and Ya‛aqoḇ. Do not look on the stubbornness of this
people, or on their wrong or on their sin, 
Deut
9:28  lest the land from which You
brought us should say, “Because יהוה was not able to
bring them to the land which He promised them, and because He hated them, He
has brought them out to kill them in the wilderness.” 
Deut
9:29  ‘And they are Your people and Your
inheritance, whom You brought out by Your great power and by Your outstretched
arm.’ 
Deut
10:1  “At that time יהוה
said to me, ‘Hew for yourself two tablets of stone like the first, and come up
to Me on the mountain. And you shall make yourself an ark of wood, 
Deut
10:2  then I write on the tablets the
Words that were on the first tablets, which you broke. And you shall put them
in the ark.’ 
Deut
10:3  “So I made an ark of acacia wood,
hewed two tablets of stone like the first, and went up the mountain, with the
two tablets in my hand. 
Deut
10:4  “And He wrote on the tablets
according to the first writing, the Ten Words, which יהוה
had spoken to you in the mountain from the midst of the fire in the day of the
assembly. Then יהוה gave them to me, 
Deut
10:5  and I turned and came down from the
mountain, and put the tablets in the ark which I had made. And they are there,
as יהוה commanded me.” 
Deut
10:6  Now the children of Yisra’ĕl
set out from the wells of Benĕi Ya‛aqan to Mosĕrah. Aharon died
there, and he was buried there. And El‛azar his son became priest in his
place. 
Deut
10:7  From there they set out to Guḏgoḏah,
and from Guḏgoḏah to Yotḇathah, a land of rivers of water. 
Deut
10:8  At that time יהוה
separated the tribe of Lĕwi to bear the ark of the covenant of יהוה,
to stand before יהוה, to serve Him, and to bless in His
Name, to this day. 
Deut
10:9  Therefore Lĕwi has no portion
nor inheritance with his brothers. יהוה is his
inheritance, as יהוה your Elohim promised him. 
Deut
10:10  “And I stayed in the mountain for
forty days and forty nights. And יהוה heard me at that
time also, and יהוה chose not to destroy you. 
Deut
10:11  “And יהוה
said to me, ‘Arise, go before the people, to set out, and let them go in and
possess the land which I swore to their fathers to give them.’ 
Deut
10:12  “And now, Yisra’ĕl, what is יהוה
your Elohim asking of you, but to fear יהוה your
Elohim, to walk in all His ways and to love Him, and to serve יהוה
your Elohim with all your heart and with all your being,

of heavens belong to יהוה your Elohim, also the earth
with all that is in it. 
Deut
10:15  “ יהוה

them, you above all peoples, as it is today.

foreskin of your heart, and harden your neck no more. 
Deut
10:17  “For יהוה

fatherless and the widow, and loves the stranger, giving him food and a

your Elohim. Serve Him, and cling to Him, and swear by His Name. 
Deut
10:21  “He is your praise, and He is your
Elohim, who has done for you these great and awesome deeds which your eyes have
seen. 
Deut

Mitsrayim with seventy beings, and now יהוה your Elohim
has made you as numerous as the stars of the heavens.

your Elohim and guard His Charge: even His laws, and His right-rulings, and His
commands, always.
Deut
11:2  “And you shall know today – for it
is not your children who have not known and who have not seen the discipline of
יהוה your Elohim, His greatness, His strong hand and
His outstretched arm, 
Deut
11:3  and His signs, and His works which
He had done in the midst of Mitsrayim, to Pharaoh sovereign of Mitsrayim, and
to all his land; 
Deut
11:4  and that which He had done to the
army of Mitsrayim, to their horses and their chariots, when He made the waters
of the Sea of Reeds overflow them as they pursued you, and how יהוה
has destroyed them to this day; 
Deut
11:5  and what He had done for you in the
wilderness till you came to this place; 
Deut
11:6  and what He had done to Dathan and
Aḇiram the sons of Eliyaḇ, son of Re’uḇĕn, when the
earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, and their households, and their
tents, and all the living creatures that were in their possession, in the midst
of all Yisra’ĕl.

which I command you today, so that you are strong, and shall go in, and shall
possess the land which you are passing over to possess, 
Deut
11:9  and to prolong your days in the
land which יהוה swore to give your fathers, to them and
their descendants, a land flowing with milk and honey. 
Deut
11:10  “For the land which you are going
in to possess is not like the land of Mitsrayim from which you have come, where
you sowed your seed and watered it by foot, as a vegetable garden, 
Deut
11:11  but the land which you are passing
over to possess is a land of hills and valleys, which drinks water from the
rain of the heavens, 
Deut
11:12  a land which יהוה
your Elohim looks after. The eyes of יהוה your Elohim
are always on it, from the beginning of the year to the latter end of the year.

Deut
11:13  ‘And it shall be that if you
diligently obey My commands which I command you today, to love יהוה
your Elohim and to serve Him with all your heart and with all your being,

your land in its season, the early rain and the latter rain, and you shall
gather in your grain, and your new wine, and your oil.

fields for your livestock, and you shall eat and be satisfied. 
Deut

be deceived, and you turn aside and serve other mighty ones and bow down to
them. 
Deut

shall burn against you, and He shall shut up the heavens, and there be no rain,
and the land not give its increase. And you shall perish quickly from the good
land which יהוה is giving you.

of Mine in your heart and in your being, and shall bind them as a sign on your
hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes.

children, speaking of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the
way, and when you lie down, and when you rise up,

doorposts of your house and on your gates, 
Deut
11:21  so that your days and the days of
your children are increased on the soil of which יהוה
swore to your fathers to give them, as the days of the heavens on the earth. 
Deut
11:22  ‘For if you diligently guard all
these commands which I command you, to do it, to love יהוה
your Elohim, to walk in all His ways, and to cling to Him,

commands of יהוה your Elohim which I command you today;

Deut

the commands of יהוה your Elohim, but turn aside from
the way which I command you today, to go after other mighty ones which you have
not known. 
Deut
11:29  ‘And it shall be, when יהוה
your Elohim has brought you into the land which you go to possess, that you
shall put the blessing on Mount Gerizim and the curse on Mount Ĕyḇal.

toward the setting sun, in the land of the Kena‛anites who dwell in the
desert plain opposite Gilgal, beside the terebinth trees of Moreh?

giving you, and you shall possess it and dwell in it,

right-rulings which you guard to do in the land which יהוה
Elohim of your fathers is giving you to possess, all the days that you live on
the soil.

high mountains and on the hills and under every green tree. 
Deut

altars, and smash their pillars, and burn their Ashĕrim with fire. And you
shall cut down the carved images of their mighty ones and shall destroy their
name out of that place.

Dwelling Place, and there you shall enter.

burnt offerings, and your offerings, and your tithes, and the contributions of
your hand, and your vowed offerings, and your voluntary offerings, and the
firstlings of your herd and of your flock.

your Elohim, and shall rejoice in all that you put your hand to, you and your
households, in which יהוה your Elohim has blessed you.

whatever is right in his own eyes.

the rest and the inheritance which יהוה your Elohim is
giving you. 
Deut

giving you to inherit, and He shall give you rest from all your enemies round
about, and you shall dwell in safety.

ensnared to follow them, after they are destroyed from before you, and that you
do not inquire about their mighty ones, saying, ‘How did these nations serve
their mighty ones? And let me do so too.’
Deut
12:31  “Do not do so to יהוה
your Elohim, for every abomination which יהוה hates

prophet or a dreamer of dreams, and he shall give you a sign or a wonder, 
Deut
13:2  and the sign or the wonder shall
come true, of which he has spoken to you, saying, ‘Let us go after other mighty
ones – which you have not known – and serve them,’ 
Deut
13:3  do not listen to the words of that
prophet or that dreamer of dreams, for יהוה your Elohim
is trying you to know whether you love יהוה your Elohim
with all your heart and with all your being. 
Deut
13:4  “Walk after יהוה
your Elohim and fear Him, and guard His commands and obey His voice, and serve
Him and cling to Him.

your Elohim – who brought you out of the land of Mitsrayim and redeemed you
from the house of bondage – to make you stray from the way in which יהוה
your Elohim commanded you to walk. Thus you shall purge the evil from your
midst.

mother, or your son or your daughter, or the wife of your bosom, or your friend
who is as your own being, entices you secretly, saying, ‘Let us go and serve
other mighty ones’– which you have not known, neither you nor your fathers,

all the people,

stones until he dies, because he sought to entice you away from יהוה
your Elohim, who brought you out of the land of Mitsrayim, from the house of
bondage.

your cities, which יהוה your Elohim gives you to dwell
in, saying,

not known –

out, and ask diligently. And see if the matter is true and established that
this abomination was done in your midst,

inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, putting it under the ban,
and all that is in it and its livestock, with the edge of the sword. 
Deut

the middle of the street, and completely burn with fire the city and all its
plunder, before יהוה your Elohim. And it shall be a

your Elohim, to guard all His commands which I command you today, to do what is
right in the eyes of יהוה your Elohim. 
Deut

your Elohim. Do not cut yourselves nor shave the front of your head for the
dead,

your Elohim, and יהוה has chosen you to be a people for
Himself, a treasured possession above all the peoples who are on the face of
the earth.

hoof divided in two, chewing the cud, among the beasts, you do eat. 
Deut
14:7  “But of those chewing the cud or
those having a split hoof completely divided, you do not eat, such as these:
the camel, and the hare, and the rabbit, for they chew the cud but do not have
a split hoof, they are unclean for you. 
Deut
14:8  “And the pig is unclean for you,
because it has a split hoof, but does not chew the cud. You do not eat their
flesh or touch their dead carcasses. 
Deut
14:9  “These you do eat of all that are
in the waters: all that have fins and scales you do eat. 
Deut

eagle, and the vulture, and the black vulture,

Deut
14:21  “Do not eat whatever dies of
itself. Give it to the stranger who is within your gates, to eat it, or sell it

Elohim always.

hand to him and certainly lend him enough for his need, whatever he needs.

15:9  “Be on guard lest there be a
thought of Beliya‛al in your heart, saying, ‘The seventh year, the year
of release, is near,’ and your eye is evil against your poor brother and you
give him naught. And he shall cry out to יהוה against
you, and it shall be a sin in you.

you, ‘I do not go away from you,’ because he loves you and your house, because
it is good for him with you,

Elohim gives you,
