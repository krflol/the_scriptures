Qolasim/Colossians
Col
1:1  Sha’ul, an emissary of יהושע
Messiah by the desire of Elohim, and Timothy our brother, 
Col
1:2  to the set-apart ones in Colosse,
and true brothers in Messiah: Favour to you and peace from Elohim our Father
and the Master יהושע Messiah. 
Col
1:3  We give thanks to the Elohim and
Father of our Master יהושע Messiah, praying
always for you, 
Col
1:4  having heard of your belief in
Messiah יהושע and of your love for all the
set-apart ones, 
Col
1:5  because of the expectation that is
laid up for you in the heavens, of which you heard before in the word of the
truth of the Good News, 
Col
1:6  which has come to you, as also in
all the world it is bearing fruit and growing, as also among you, since the day
you heard and knew the favour of Elohim in truth, 
Col
1:7  as you also learned from Epaphras,
our beloved fellow servant, who is a true servant of Messiah on your behalf, 
Col
1:8  who also declared to us your love in
the Spirit. 
Col
1:9  That is also why we, from the day we
heard, have not ceased praying for you, and asking that you be filled with the
knowledge of His desire in all wisdom and spiritual understanding, 
Col
1:10  to walk worthily of the Master,
pleasing all, bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge
of Elohim, 
Col
1:11  being empowered with all power,
according to the might of His esteem, for all endurance and patience with joy, 
Col
1:12  giving thanks to the Father who has
made us fit to share in the inheritance of the set-apart ones in the light, 
Col
1:13  who has delivered us from the
authority of darkness and transferred us into the reign of the Son of His love,
Col
1:14  in whom we have redemption through
His blood, the forgiveness of sins, 
Col
1:15  who is the likeness of the
invisible Elohim, the first-born of all creation.
Col
1:16  Because in Him were created all
that are in the heavens and that are on earth, visible and invisible, whether
thrones or rulerships or principalities or authorities – all have been created
through Him and for Him. 
Col
1:17  And He is before all, and in Him
all hold together. 
Col
1:18  And He is the Head of the body, the
assembly, who is the beginning, the first-born from the dead, that He might
become the One who is first in all. 
Col
1:19  Because in Him all the completeness
was well pleased to dwell, 
Col
1:20  and through Him to completely
restore to favour all unto Himself, whether on earth or in the heavens, having
made peace through the blood of His stake. 
Col
1:21  And you, who once were estranged
and enemies in the mind by wicked works, but now He has completely restored to
favour 
Col
1:22  in the body of His flesh through
death, to present you set-apart, and blameless, and unreprovable before Him, 
Col
1:23  if indeed you continue in the
belief, founded and steadfast, and are not moved away from the expectation of
the Good News which you heard, which was proclaimed to every creature under the
heaven, of which I, Sha’ul, became a servant, 
Col
1:24  who now rejoice in my sufferings
for you, and fill up in my flesh what is lacking in Messiah’s afflictions, for
the sake of His Body, which is the assembly, 
Col
1:25  of which I became a servant
according to the administration of Elohim which was given to me for you, to
fill the word of Elohim, 
Col
1:26  the secret which has been hidden
from ages and from generations, but now has been revealed to His set-apart
ones, 
Col
1:27  to whom Elohim desired to make
known what are the riches of the esteem of this secret among the gentiles:
which is Messiah in you, the expectancy of esteem,
Col
1:28  whom we announce, warning every man
and teaching every man in all wisdom, in order to present every man perfect in
Messiah יהושע, 
Col
1:29  for which I also labour, striving
according to the working of Him who works in me in power. 
Col
2:1  For I wish you to know what a great
struggle I have for you and those in Laodikeia, and for as many as have not
seen my face in the flesh, 
Col
2:2  in order that their hearts might be
encouraged, being knit together in love, and to all riches of the entire
confirmation of understanding, to a true knowledge of the secret of Elohim, and
of the Father, and of the Messiah, 
Col
2:3  in whom are hidden all the treasures
of wisdom and knowledge.
Col
2:4  And this I say, so that no one
deceives you with enticing words. 
Col
2:5  For though I am absent in the flesh,
yet I am with you in spirit, rejoicing to see your good order and the
steadfastness of your belief in Messiah. 
Col
2:6  Therefore, as you accepted Messiah יהושע
the Master, walk in Him, 
Col
2:7  having been rooted and built up in
Him, and established in the belief, as you were taught, overflowing in it with
thanksgiving. 
Col
2:8  See to it that no one makes a prey
of you through philosophy and empty deceit, according to the tradition of men,
according to the elementary matters of the world, and not according to Messiah.
Col
2:9  Because in Him dwells all the
completeness of the Mightiness bodily, 
Col
2:10  and you have been made complete in
Him, who is the Head of all principality and authority. 
Col
2:11  In Him you were also circumcised
with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the
sins of the flesh, by the circumcision of Messiah, 
Col
2:12  having been buried with Him in
immersion, in which you also were raised with Him through the belief in the
working of Elohim, who raised Him from the dead. 
Col
2:13  And you, being dead in your
trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, He has made alive together
with Him, having forgiven you all trespasses,
Col
2:14  having blotted out the certificate
of debt against us – by the dogmas – which stood against us. And He has taken
it out of the way, having nailed it to the stake. 
Col
2:15  Having stripped the principalities
and the authorities, He made a public display of them, having prevailed over
them in it. 
Col
2:16  Let no one therefore judge you in
eating or in drinking, or in respect of a festival or a new moon or Sabbaths – 
Col
2:17  which are a shadow of what is to
come – but the Body of the Messiah. 
Col
2:18  Let no one deprive you of the
prize, one who takes delight in false humility and worship of messengers,
taking his stand on what he has not seen, puffed up by his fleshly mind, 
Col
2:19  and not holding fast to the Head,
from whom all the Body – nourished and knit together by joints and ligaments –
grows with the growth of Elohim. 
Col
2:20  If, then, you died with Messiah
from the elementary matters of the world, why, as though living in the world,
do you subject yourselves to regulations:
Col
2:21  “Do not touch, do not taste, do not
handle” – 
Col
2:22  which are all to perish with use –
according to the commands and teachings of men?
Col
2:23  These indeed have an appearance of
wisdom in self-imposed worship, humiliation and harsh treatment of the body –
of no value at all, only for
satisfaction of the flesh. 
Col
3:1  If, then, you were raised with
Messiah, seek the matters which are
above, where Messiah is, seated at the right hand of Elohim. 
Col
3:2  Mind the matters above, not those on the earth. 
Col
3:3  For you have died, and your life has
been hidden with Messiah in Elohim. 
Col
3:4  When the Messiah, who is our life,
is manifested, then you also shall be manifested with Him in esteem. 
Col
3:5  Therefore put to death your members
which are on the earth: whoring, uncleanness, passion, evil desire and greed of
gain, which is idolatry. 
Col
3:6  Because of these the wrath of Elohim
is coming upon the sons of disobedience,
Col
3:7  in which you also once walked when
you lived in them. 
Col
3:8  But now, also put off all these:
displeasure, wrath, evil, blasphemy, filthy talk from your mouth. 
Col
3:9  Do not lie to each other, since you
have put off the old man with his practices,
Col
3:10  and have put on the new one who is
renewed in knowledge according to the likeness of Him who created him, 
Col
3:11  where there is not Greek and Yehuḏite,
circumcised and uncircumcised, foreigner, Scythian, slave, free, but Messiah is
all, and in all. 
Col
3:12  Therefore, as chosen ones of
Elohim, set-apart and beloved, put on compassion, kindness, humbleness of mind,
meekness, patience, 
Col
3:13  bearing with one another, and
forgiving each other if anyone has a complaint against another, indeed, as
Messiah forgave you so also should you. 
Col
3:14  But above all these put on love, which is a bond of the
perfection. 
Col
3:15  And let the peace of Elohim rule in
your hearts, to which indeed you were called in one Body, and be filled with
thanks. 
Col
3:16  Let the Word of Messiah dwell in
you richly, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing with
pleasure in your hearts to the Master in psalms and songs of praise and
spiritual songs.
Col
3:17  And whatever you do in word or
deed, do all in the Name of the
Master יהושע, giving thanks to Elohim the Father
through Him. 
Col
3:18  Wives, subject yourselves to your
own husbands, as is proper in the Master. 
Col
3:19  Husbands, love your wives and do
not be bitter toward them. 
Col
3:20  Children, obey your parents in all,
for this is well-pleasing to the Master. 
Col
3:21  Fathers, do not provoke your
children, lest they become discouraged. 
Col
3:22  Servants, obey your masters
according to the flesh in all respects, not with eye-service, as men-pleasers,
but in sincerity of heart, fearing Elohim. 
Col
3:23  And whatever you do, do it
heartily, as to the Master and not to men, 
Col
3:24  knowing that from the Master you
shall receive the reward of the inheritance. It is the Master, Messiah, you
serve. 
Col
3:25  But he who does wrong shall be
repaid for the wrong which he has done, and there is no partiality. 
Col
4:1  Masters, give your servants what is
righteous and fair, knowing that you also have a Master in the heavens. 
Col
4:2  Continue in prayer, watching
therein, with thanksgiving, 
Col
4:3  praying at the same time also for
us, that Elohim would open to us a door for the word, to speak the secret of
Messiah, for which I am also in chains, 
Col
4:4  so that I make it clear, as I should
speak. 
Col
4:5  Walk in wisdom toward those who are
outside, redeeming the time. 
Col
4:6  Let your word always be with favour,
seasoned with salt, so that you know how you ought to answer each one. 
Col
4:7  Tuchikos, who is a beloved brother,
a true servant, and a fellow servant in the Master, shall give you all the news
about me. 
Col
4:8  I am sending him to you for this
purpose, to know your circumstances and to encourage your hearts, 
Col
4:9  with Onesimos, a true and beloved
brother, who is one of you. They shall let you know all the news here. 
Col
4:10  Aristarchos my fellow prisoner
greets you, with Mark the relative of Barnaḇah about whom you received
instructions: if he comes to you, welcome him, 
Col
4:11  also Yeshua who is called Justus.
These are my only fellow workers for the reign of Elohim who are of the circumcision,
who were to me a comfort. 
Col
4:12  Epaphras, who is one of you, a
servant of Messiah, greets you, always wrestling for you in prayers, so that
you stand perfect and complete in all the desire of Elohim.
Col
4:13  For I bear him witness that he has
a deep concern for you, and for those who are in Laodikeia and those in
Hierapolis. 
Col
4:14  Luke the beloved physician and
Demas greet you. 
Col
4:15  Greet the brothers in Laodikeia,
and Numpha and the assembly that is in his house. 
Col
4:16  And when this letter is read among
you, see that it is read also in the assembly of the Laodikeians, and that you
likewise read the letter from Laodikeia. 
Col
4:17  And say to Archippos, “See to the
service which you have received in the Master, so that you complete it.” 
Col
4:18  This greeting is in my own hand –
Sha’ul. Remember my chains. Favour be with you. Amĕn.
