Pilipiyim/Philippians
Philip
1:1  Sha’ul and Timothy, servants of יהושע
Messiah, to all the set-apart ones in Messiah יהושע
who are in Philippi, with the overseers and attendants: 
Philip
1:2  Favour to you and peace from Elohim
our Father and the Master יהושע Messiah. 
Philip
1:3  I thank my Elohim in all my
remembrance of you. 
Philip
1:4  In all my prayers for all of you, I
always pray with joy, 
Philip
1:5  for your fellowship in the Good News
from the first day until now, 
Philip
1:6  being persuaded of this, that He who
has begun a good work in you shall perfect it until the day of יהושע
Messiah.
Philip
1:7  It is right for me to think this of
you all, because I have you in my heart, all of you being sharers of the favour
with me, both in my chains and in the defence and confirmation of the Good
News. 
Philip
1:8  For Elohim is my witness, how I long
for you all with the affection of יהושע Messiah. 
Philip
1:9  And this I pray, that your love
might extend more and more in knowledge and all discernment, 
Philip
1:10  for you to examine the matters that differ, in order to be
sincere, and not stumbling, until the day of Messiah, 
Philip
1:11  being filled with the fruit of
righteousness, through יהושע Messiah, to the
esteem and praise of Elohim.
Philip
1:12  And I wish you to know, brothers,
that what has befallen me has turned out for the advancement of the Good News, 
Philip
1:13  so that it has become known to all
the palace guard, and to all the rest, that my chains are in Messiah; 
Philip
1:14  and most of the brothers, trusting
in the Master because of my chains, are much more bold to fearlessly speak the
word. 
Philip
1:15  Some indeed proclaim Messiah even
from envy and strife, but some also out of pleasure – 
Philip
1:16  the former announce Messiah from
selfish ambition, not sincerely, thinking to add distress to my chains, 
Philip
1:17  but the latter out of love, knowing
that I am appointed for the defence of the Good News. 
Philip
1:18  What then? Only that in every way,
whether in pretence or in truth, Messiah is announced. And in this I rejoice,
in fact, I shall rejoice. 
Philip
1:19  For I know that this shall turn out
for my deliverance through your prayer and the supply of the Spirit of יהושע
Messiah, 
Philip
1:20  according to my intense longing and
anticipation that I shall not be ashamed at all, but that with all boldness, as
always, so now also Messiah shall be made great in my body, whether by life or
by death. 
Philip
1:21  For to me, to live is Messiah, and
to die is gain. 
Philip
1:22  And if to live in the flesh is to
me a fruit of work, then what shall I choose? I do not know. 
Philip
1:23  For I am pressed down by the two,
having a desire to depart and be with Messiah, which is much better, 
Philip
1:24  but to remain in the flesh is more
necessary for your sake. 
Philip
1:25  And being persuaded of this, I know
that I shall stay and continue with you all, for your progress and joy of
belief, 
Philip
1:26  so that your boasting might
overflow in יהושע Messiah on account of me,
through my coming to you again. 
Philip
1:27  Only, behave yourselves worthily of
the Good News of Messiah, in order that whether I come and see you or am
absent, I hear about you, that you stand fast in one spirit, with one being,
striving together for the belief of the Good News, 
Philip
1:28  without being frightened in any way
by those who oppose, which to them truly is a proof of destruction, but to you
of deliverance, and that from Elohim. 
Philip
1:29  Because to you it has been given as
a favour, on behalf of Messiah, not only to believe in Him, but also to suffer
for His sake, 
Philip
1:30  having the same struggle which you
saw in me, and now hear to be in me. 
Philip
2:1  If, then, there is any encouragement
in Messiah, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of Spirit, if any
affection and compassion, 
Philip
2:2  make my joy complete by being of the
same mind, having the same love, one in being and of purpose, 
Philip
2:3  doing none at all through
selfishness or self-conceit, but in humility consider others better than
yourselves. 
Philip
2:4  Each one should look out not only
for his own interests, but also for the interests of others. 
Philip
2:5  For, let this mind be in you which
was also in Messiah יהושע, 
Philip
2:6  who, being in the form of Elohim,
did not regard equality with Elohim a matter to be grasped, 
Philip
2:7  but emptied Himself, taking the form
of a servant, and came to be in the likeness of men. 
Philip
2:8  And having been found in fashion as
a man, He humbled Himself and became obedient unto death, death even of a
stake. 
Philip
2:9  Elohim, therefore, has highly
exalted Him and given Him the Name which is above every name, 
Philip
2:10  that at the Name of יהושע
every knee should bow, of those in heaven, and of those on earth, and of those
under the earth, 
Philip
2:11  and every tongue should confess
that יהושע Messiah is Master, to the esteem of
Elohim the Father. 
Philip
2:12  So that, my beloved, as you always
obeyed – not only in my presence, but now much rather in my absence – work out
your own deliverance with fear and trembling, 
Philip
2:13  for it is Elohim who is working in
you both to desire and to work for His
good pleasure.
Philip
2:14  Do all matters without grumblings and disputings, 
Philip
2:15  in order that you be blameless and
faultless, children of Elohim without blemish in the midst of a crooked and
perverse generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world, 
Philip
2:16  holding on to the Word of life, for
a boast to me in the day of Messiah, that I have not run in vain or laboured in
vain. 
Philip
2:17  In fact, even if I am being poured
out as a drink offering on the offering and service of your belief, I am glad
and rejoice with you all. 
Philip
2:18  So you too should be glad and
rejoice with me. 
Philip
2:19  But I trust in the Master יהושע
to send Timothy to you shortly, so that I too am encouraged by news from you. 
Philip
2:20  For I have no one else of the same mind, who takes a
genuine interest in your welfare. 
Philip
2:21  For all seek their own interests, not those of Messiah יהושע.

Philip
2:22  But you know he has proven himself,
that as a son with his father he served with me for the Good News. 
Philip
2:23  So I expect to send him as soon as
I see how it goes with me, 
Philip
2:24  and I trust in the Master that I
myself shall also come shortly. 
Philip
2:25  But I thought it necessary to send
to you Epaphroditos, my brother, fellow worker, and fellow soldier, and your
emissary and servant to my need, 
Philip
2:26  since he was longing for you all,
and being troubled because you had heard that he was sick. 
Philip
2:27  For indeed he was sick, near to
death, but Elohim had compassion on him, and not only on him but on me as well,
lest I should have sadness upon sadness. 
Philip
2:28  Therefore I sent him more eagerly,
so that on seeing him again you might rejoice, and I be less sad. 
Philip
2:29  Receive him therefore in the Master
with all joy, and hold such as he in esteem, 
Philip
2:30  because for the work of Messiah he
was near death, risking his life, to fill up what was lacking in your service
toward me. 
Philip
3:1  For the rest, my brothers, rejoice
in יהוה. To write the same matters to you is truly no trouble to me, and for you it is safe. 
Philip
3:2  Look out for dogs, look out for the
evil workers, look out for the mutilation! 
Philip
3:3  For we are the circumcision, who are
serving Elohim in the Spirit, and boasting in Messiah יהושע,
and do not trust in the flesh, 
Philip
3:4  though I too might have trust in the
flesh. If anyone else thinks to trust in the flesh, I more – 
Philip
3:5  circumcised the eighth day, of the
race of Yisra’ĕl, of the tribe of Binyamin, a Heḇrew of Heḇrews,
according to Torah a Pharisee, 
Philip
3:6  according to ardour, persecuting the
assembly; according to righteousness that is in the law, having become
blameless. 
Philip
3:7  But what might have been a gain to
me, I have counted as loss, because of Messiah. 
Philip
3:8  What is more, I even count all to be
loss because of the excellence of the knowledge of Messiah יהושע
my Master, for whom I have suffered the loss of all, and count them as refuse,
in order to gain Messiah, 
Philip
3:9  and be found in Him, not having my
own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through belief in
Messiah, the righteousness which is from Elohim on the basis of belief, 
Philip
3:10  to know Him, and the power of His
resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His
death, 
Philip
3:11  if somehow I might attain to the
resurrection from the dead. 
Philip
3:12  Not that I have already received,
or already been perfected, but I press on, to lay hold of that for which
Messiah יהושע has also laid hold of me. 
Philip
3:13  Brothers, I do not count myself to
have laid hold of it yet, but only this: forgetting what is behind and reaching
out for what lies ahead, 
Philip
3:14  I press on toward the goal for the
prize of the high calling of Elohim in Messiah יהושע.

Philip
3:15  As many, then, as are perfect,
should have this mind. And if you think differently in any respect, Elohim
shall also reveal this to you. 
Philip
3:16  But to what we have already attained – walk by the same
rule, be of the same mind. 
Philip
3:17  Become joint imitators of me,
brothers, and observe those who so walk, as you have us for a pattern. 
Philip
3:18  For many – of whom I have often
told you, and now say to you even weeping – walk as enemies of the stake of Messiah. 
Philip
3:19  Their end is destruction, their
mighty one is their stomach, and their esteem is in their shame – they mind the
earthly. 
Philip
3:20  For our citizenship is in the
heavens, from which we also eagerly wait for the Saviour, the Master יהושע
Messiah, 
Philip
3:21  who shall change our lowly body, to
be conformed to His esteemed body, according to the working by which He is able
even to bring all under His control. 
Philip
4:1  So then, my brothers, beloved and
longed-for, my joy and crown, stand firm in the Master, beloved. 
Philip
4:2  I appeal to Euodia and I appeal to
Suntuche to be of the same mind in the Master. 
Philip
4:3  And I also ask you, true companion,
help these women who laboured with me in the Good News, with Qlemes also, and
the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the Book of Life. 
Philip
4:4  Rejoice in יהוה
always, again I say, rejoice! 
Philip
4:5  Let your gentleness be known to all
men. The Master is near. 
Philip
4:6  Do not worry at all, but in every matter, by prayer and petition, with
thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to Elohim. 
Philip
4:7  And the peace of Elohim, which
surpasses all understanding, shall guard your hearts and minds through Messiah יהושע.

Philip
4:8  For the rest, brothers, whatever is
true, whatever is noble, whatever is righteous, whatever is clean, whatever is
lovely, whatever is of good report, if there is any uprightness and if there is
any praise – think on these. 
Philip
4:9  And what you have learned and
received and heard and saw in me, practise these, and the Elohim of peace shall
be with you. 
Philip
4:10  And I rejoiced in יהוה
greatly that now at last your concern for me has revived again – though you
were concerned, but had no chance. 
Philip
4:11  Not that I speak concerning need,
for I have learned to be content in whatever state I am. 
Philip
4:12  I know what it is to be humbled,
and I know what it is to have in excess. In any and every situation I have learned both to be filled, and to be hungry, both
to have in excess, and to be in need. 
Philip
4:13  I have strength to do all, through
Messiah who empowers me.
Philip
4:14  Yet you did well in sharing in my
pressure. 
Philip
4:15  And you know too, Philippians, that
in the beginning of the Good News, when I went out from Makedonia, no assembly
shared with me concerning giving and receiving, except you only, 
Philip
4:16  because, even in Thessalonike you
sent to my need, once and twice. 
Philip
4:17  Not that I seek the gift, but I
seek the fruit that is multiplying to your account. 
Philip
4:18  Indeed I have all and more than
enough. I have been filled, having received from Epaphroditos what you sent, a
sweet-smelling fragrance, an acceptable offering, well-pleasing to Elohim. 
Philip
4:19  And my Elohim shall fill all your
need according to His riches in esteem by Messiah יהושע.

Philip
4:20  And to our Elohim and Father be
esteem forever and ever. Amĕn. 
Philip
4:21  Greet every set-apart one in
Messiah יהושע. The brothers with me greet you. 
Philip
4:22  All the set-apart ones greet you,
but most of all those of Caesar’s household. 
Philip
4:23  The favour of our Master יהושע
Messiah be with you all. Amĕn.
