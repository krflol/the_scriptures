Naḥum/Nahum
Nahum
1:1  The message concerning Ninewĕh.
The book of the vision of Naḥum the Elqoshite. 
Nahum
1:2  יהוה is a
jealous and revenging Ĕl, יהוה is a revenger and a
possessor of wrath. יהוה takes vengeance on His
adversaries, and He watches for His enemies. 
Nahum
1:3  יהוה is
patient and great in power, but by no means leaves unpunished. יהוה
has His way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of
His feet. 
Nahum
1:4  He is rebuking the sea and dries it
up. And all the floods He has made dry, Bashan and Karmel are withering, and
the flower of Leḇanon is languishing. 
Nahum
1:5  Mountains have shaken before Him,
and the hills have melted. And the earth is lifted up at His presence, and the
world and all who dwell in it. 
Nahum
1:6  Who does stand before His rage? And
who rises up in the heat of His displeasure? His wrath is poured out like fire,
and the rocks have been broken by Him. 
Nahum
1:7  יהוה is
good, as a stronghold in the day of distress. And He knows those who take
refuge in Him. 
Nahum
1:8  But with an overwhelming flood He
makes a complete end of the place of Ninewĕh,
and darkness does pursue His enemies. 
Nahum
1:9  What do you plot against יהוה
? He makes a complete end of it. Distress does not rise up a second time. 
Nahum
1:10  Though they are as entangled
thorns, and as drunkards with their drink, they shall be consumed like stubble
thoroughly dried. 
Nahum
1:11  From you came forth one who plots
evil against יהוה, a counsellor of Beliya‛al. 
Nahum
1:12  Thus said יהוה,
“Though they are strong and many, even so, they shall be cut off and pass away.
Though I have afflicted you, I afflict you no more. 
Nahum
1:13  “So now I break his yoke from you,
and tear off your shackles.” 
Nahum
1:14  And יהוה
has commanded concerning you, “Your name shall no longer be sown. From the
house of your mighty ones I shall cut off the carved image and the moulded
image. I shall appoint your grave, for you have been of no account.” 
Nahum
1:15  See, on the mountains the feet of
him who brings good news, who proclaims peace! O Yehuḏah, observe your
festivals, perform your vows. For Beliya‛al shall no more pass through
you. He has been cut off completely. 
Nahum
2:1  He who breaks in pieces has come up
before your face. Guard the ramparts! Watch the way! Strengthen your loins!
Strengthen your power greatly. 
Nahum
2:2  For יהוה
shall turn back the splendour of Ya‛aqoḇ like the splendour of
Yisra’ĕl, for the emptiers have emptied them out and ruined their vine
branches. 
Nahum
2:3  The shields of his mighty men have
become red, the men of battle are in scarlet. The chariots are like flaming
torches in the day of his preparation, and the cypresses shall be shaken. 
Nahum
2:4  The chariots dash about in the
streets, they rush one another in the broad ways. They look like flaming
torches, they run like lightning. 
Nahum
2:5  He remembers his noble ones, they
stumble in their walk, they hurry to her walls, and the defence is prepared. 
Nahum
2:6  The river gates have been opened,
and the palace is melted. 
Nahum
2:7  And it is established: she shall be
exiled, she shall be led away. And her female servants are moaning as with the
voice of doves, beating on their breasts. 
Nahum
2:8  And Ninewĕh of old was like a
pool of water, now they flee away. “Stop! Stop!” they cry, but no one turns
back. 
Nahum
2:9  Plunder the silver! Plunder the
gold! There is no limit to the treasure – a wealth of all precious objects. 
Nahum
2:10  She is empty, even emptiness and
waste! And the heart has melted, and the knees have knocked together, and much
pain is in all loins, and all their faces have become flushed. 
Nahum
2:11  Where is the den of the lions, and
the feeding place of the young lions, where the lion, the lioness and the lion’s
cub walked, with no one to disturb them? 
Nahum
2:12  The lion tore in pieces enough for
his cubs, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his caves with prey, and
his dens with torn prey. 
Nahum
2:13  “See, I am against you,” declares יהוה
of hosts, “and I shall burn your chariots in smoke, and the sword devour your
young lions. And I shall cut off your prey from the earth, and no longer is the
voice of your messengers heard.” 
Nahum
3:1  Woe to the city of blood! All of it
is a lie, filled with plunder, the prey is not lacking. 
Nahum
3:2  The sound of a whip and the sound of
rattling wheels, of galloping horses, of jolting chariots, 
Nahum
3:3  mounted horsemen with bright sword
and glittering spear, and many wounded, and a mass of dead bodies, and no end
of corpses, they stumble over the corpses – 
Nahum
3:4  because of the many whorings of the
well-favoured whore, the mistress of sorceries, who sells nations by her
whorings, and clans by her sorceries. 
Nahum
3:5  “See, I am against you,” declares יהוה
of hosts, “and shall lift up your skirts over your face, and shall show nations
your nakedness, and reigns your shame. 
Nahum
3:6  “And I shall cast abominations upon
you, and treat you as foolish, and make a spectacle of you. 
Nahum
3:7  “And it shall be that all who see
you flee from you, and say, ‘Ninewĕh is laid waste! Who does mourn for
her?’ Where do I seek comforters for you?” 
Nahum
3:8  Are you better than No Amon, who
dwelt by the Nile-streams, with waters around her, whose rampart was like the
sea, whose wall was like the sea? 
Nahum
3:9  Kush and Mitsrayim were her
strength, even unlimited. Put and Luḇim were your helpers. 
Nahum
3:10  Yet she was exiled, she went into
captivity. At the head of every street her young children were dashed to
pieces. Lots were cast for her esteemed men, and all her great men were bound
in chains. 
Nahum
3:11  You too are to become drunk, you
are to go into hiding. You too are to seek refuge from the enemy. 
Nahum
3:12  All your strongholds are fig trees
with ripened figs, when shaken they shall fall into the mouth of the eater. 
Nahum
3:13  See, your people in your midst are
women! The gates of your land shall be opened wide to your enemies. Fire shall
consume your gate bars. 
Nahum
3:14  Draw for yourself water for the
siege! Strengthen your defences! Go into the clay and tread the mortar, lay
hold of the brick mould! 
Nahum
3:15  There a fire shall consume you, a
sword cut you off, eat you up like a locust. Make yourself many like the
locust, make yourself many like the swarming locust! 
Nahum
3:16  You have increased your merchants
more than the stars of the heavens. The locust shall strip off and fly away. 
Nahum
3:17  Your officials are like the
locusts, and your marshals are like the great grasshoppers, which settle in the
hedges on a cold day – when the sun rises they flee away, and the place where
they are is unknown. 
Nahum
3:18  Your shepherds have slumbered, O
sovereign of Ashshur, your nobles lie down to rest. Your people are scattered
on the mountains, and no one gathers them. 
Nahum
3:19  Your injury has no healing, your
wound is grievous. All who hear news of you shall clap their hands over you.
For over whom did your evil not pass continually?
