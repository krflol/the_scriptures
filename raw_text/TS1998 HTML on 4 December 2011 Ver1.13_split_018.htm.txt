Melaḵim Bĕt/2 Kings
2Kings
1:1  And Mo’aḇ revolted against
Yisra’ĕl after the death of Aḥaḇ. 
2Kings
1:2  And Aḥazyah fell through the
lattice of his upper room in Shomeron, and was injured, and sent messengers and
said to them, “Go, inquire of Ba‛al-Zeḇuḇ, the mighty one of
Eqron, if I shall recover from this injury.” 
2Kings
1:3  But a messenger of יהוה
spoke to Ĕliyah the Tishbite, “Rise up, go up to meet the messengers of
the sovereign of Shomeron, and say to them, ‘Is it because there is no Elohim
in Yisra’ĕl that you are going to inquire of Ba‛al-Zeḇuḇ,
the mighty one of Eqron?’ 
2Kings
1:4  “So therefore, thus said יהוה,
‘You are not going to get out of the bed to which you have gone up, for you
shall certainly die.’ ” And Ĕliyah went. 
2Kings
1:5  And the messengers returned to him,
and he said to them, “Why have you come back?” 
2Kings
1:6  And they said to him, “A man came up
to meet us, and said to us, ‘Go, return to the sovereign who sent you, and say
to him, “Thus said יהוה, ‘Is it because there is no
Elohim in Yisra’ĕl that you are sending to inquire of Ba‛al-Zeḇuḇ,
the mighty one of Eqron? Therefore you are not going to get out of the bed to
which you have gone up, for you shall certainly die.’ ” ’ ” 
2Kings
1:7  And he said to them, “What was the
man like who came up to meet you and spoke to you these words?” 
2Kings
1:8  And they answered him, “He was a
hairy man, and wore a leather girdle around his waist.” And he said, “It is Ĕliyah
the Tishbite.” 
2Kings
1:9  He then sent to him a captain of
fifty with his fifty men. And he went up to him, and see, he was sitting on the
top of a hill. And he spoke to him, “Man of Elohim, the sovereign has said, ‘Come
down!’ ” 
2Kings
1:10  And Ĕliyahu answered and said
to the captain of fifty, “And if I am a man of Elohim, let fire come down from
the heavens and consume you and your fifty men.” And fire came down from the
heavens and consumed him and his fifty. 
2Kings
1:11  He then sent another captain of
fifty with his fifty men to him. And he answered and said to him, “Man of
Elohim, this is what the sovereign said, ‘Come down at once!’ ” 
2Kings
1:12  And Ĕliyah answered and said
to them, “If I am a man of Elohim, let fire come down from the heavens and
consume you and your fifty men.” And a fire of Elohim came down from the
heavens and consumed him and his fifty. 
2Kings
1:13  And again he sent a third captain
of fifty with his fifty men. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came
and fell on his knees before Ĕliyahu, and pleaded with him, and said to
him, “Man of Elohim, please let my life and the life of these fifty servants of
yours be precious in your eyes. 
2Kings
1:14  “See, fire has come down from the
heavens and burned up the first two captains of fifties with their fifties. But
let my life be precious in your eyes.” 
2Kings
1:15  And the Messenger of יהוה
said to Ĕliyahu, “Go down with him; do not be afraid of him.” So he rose
up and went down with him to the sovereign, 
2Kings
1:16  and spoke to him, “Thus said יהוה,
‘Because you have sent messengers to inquire of Ba‛al-Zeḇuḇ,
the mighty one of Eqron, is it because there is no Elohim in Yisra’ĕl to
inquire of His word? Therefore you are not going to get out of the bed to which
you have gone up, for you shall certainly die.’ ” 
2Kings
1:17  And he died, according to the word
of יהוה which Ĕliyahu had spoken. And Yehoram
reigned in his place, in the second year of Yehoram son of Yehoshaphat
sovereign of Yehuḏah, for he had no son. 
2Kings
1:18  And the rest of the acts of
Aḥazyahu which he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of
the sovereigns of Yisra’ĕl? 
2Kings
2:1  And it came to be, when יהוה
was to take up Ĕliyahu to the heavens by a whirlwind, that Ĕliyahu
went with Elisha from Gilgal. 
2Kings
2:2  And Ĕliyahu said to Elisha, “Please
remain here, for יהוה has sent me on to Bĕyth Ĕl.”
And Elisha said, “As יהוה lives, and as your being
lives, I do not leave you!” And they went down to Bĕyth Ĕl. 
2Kings
2:3  And the sons of the prophets who
were at Bĕyth Ĕl came out to Elisha, and said to him, “Do you know
that יהוה is taking away your master from your head?”
And he said, “I also know, be silent!” 
2Kings
2:4  And Ĕliyahu said to him, “Elisha,
please remain here, for יהוה has sent me on to
Yeriḥo.” And he said, “As יהוה lives, and as your
being lives, I do not leave you!” And they came into Yeriḥo. 
2Kings
2:5  And the sons of the prophets who
were at Yeriḥo came to Elisha and said to him, “Do you know that יהוה
is taking away your master from over you today?” And he said, “I also know, be
silent!” 
2Kings
2:6  And Ĕliyahu said to him, “Please
remain here, for יהוה has sent me on to the Yardĕn.”
And he said, “As יהוה lives, and as your being lives, I
do not leave you!” And the two of them went on. 
2Kings
2:7  And fifty men of the sons of the
prophets went and stood facing them at a distance, while the two of them stood
by the Yardĕn. 
2Kings
2:8  And Ĕliyahu took his mantle,
and rolled it up, and struck the water. And it was divided this way and that,
so that the two of them passed over on dry ground. 
2Kings
2:9  And it came to be, when they had
passed over, that Ĕliyahu said to Elisha, “Ask what I am to do for you,
before I am taken away from you!” And Elisha said, “Please let a double portion
of your spirit be upon me.” 
2Kings
2:10  And he said, “You have made it hard
to ask, yet if you see me when I am taken from you, it is yours; but if not, it
is not.” 
2Kings
2:11  And it came to be, as they
continued on and spoke, that see, a chariot of fire with horses of fire which
separated the two of them. And Ĕliyahu went up by a whirlwind into the
heavens. 
2Kings
2:12  And Elisha saw it, and he cried
out, “My father, my father, the chariot of Yisra’ĕl and its horsemen!” And
he saw him no more. Then he took hold of his own garments and tore them into
two pieces. 
2Kings
2:13  And he took up the mantle of Ĕliyahu
that had fallen from him, and went back and stood by the bank of the Yardĕn.

2Kings
2:14  And he took the mantle of Ĕliyahu
that had fallen from him, and struck the water, and said, “Where is יהוה
Elohim of Ĕliyahu?” And he struck the water, and it was divided this way
and that, and Elisha passed over. 
2Kings
2:15  And when the sons of the prophets
who were from Yeriḥo saw him, they said, “The spirit of Ĕliyahu
rests on Elisha.” And they came to meet him, and bowed to the ground before
him. 
2Kings
2:16  And they said to him, “Look, there
are fifty strong men with your servants. Please let them go and search for your
master, lest the Spirit of יהוה has taken him up and
cast him upon some mountain or into some valley.” And he said, “Send no one.” 
2Kings
2:17  But they pressed upon him till he
was ashamed, and he said, “Send.” So they sent fifty men, and they searched for
three days but did not find him. 
2Kings
2:18  And they returned to him, for he
remained in Yeriḥo, and he said to them, “Did I not say to you, ‘Do not
go’?” 
2Kings
2:19  And the men of the city said to
Elisha, “Look, the site of this city is good, as my master sees, but the waters
are spoilt, and the soil barren.” 
2Kings
2:20  And he said, “Bring me a new bowl,
and put salt in it.” And they brought it to him. 
2Kings
2:21  And he went out to the source of
the water, and threw salt in there, and said, “Thus said יהוה,
‘I have healed this water – no longer shall death or barrenness come from it.’ ”

2Kings
2:22  And the waters were healed, to this
day, according to the word of Elisha which he spoke. 
2Kings
2:23  And he went up from there to Bĕyth
Ĕl. And as he was going up the way, some youths came from the city and
mocked him, and said to him, “Go up, baldhead! Go up, baldhead!” 
2Kings
2:24  And he turned around and looked at
them, and pronounced a curse on them in the Name of יהוה.
And two female bears came out of the forest and tore to pieces forty-two of the
youths. 
2Kings
2:25  And from there he went to Mount
Karmel, and from there he returned to Shomeron. 
2Kings
3:1  And Yehoram son of Aḥaḇ
began to reign over Yisra’ĕl at Shomeron in the eighteenth year of
Yehoshaphat sovereign of Yehuḏah, and reigned twelve years. 
2Kings
3:2  And he did evil in the eyes of יהוה,
but not like his father and mother; for he removed the statue of Ba‛al
which his father had made.
2Kings
3:3  But he clung to the sins of Yaroḇ‛am
son of Neḇat, who had made Yisra’ĕl sin. He did not turn away from
them. 
2Kings
3:4  And Mĕysha sovereign of Mo’aḇ
was a sheep-breeder, and he paid the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl one hundred
thousand lambs and the wool of one hundred thousand rams. 
2Kings
3:5  And it came to be, when Aḥaḇ
died, that the sovereign of Mo’aḇ revolted against the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl.

2Kings
3:6  And Sovereign Yehoram went out of
Shomeron at that time and mustered all Yisra’ĕl. 
2Kings
3:7  And he went and sent to Yehoshaphat
sovereign of Yehuḏah, saying, “The sovereign of Mo’aḇ has revolted
against me. Do you go with me to fight against Mo’aḇ?” And he said, “I go
up. I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.” 
2Kings
3:8  And he said, “Which way do we go up?”
And he said, “By way of the Wilderness of Eḏom.” 
2Kings
3:9  And the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl
went, and the sovereign of Yehuḏah and the sovereign of Eḏom, and
went round a journey of seven days. And there was no water for the army, nor
for the cattle that followed them. 
2Kings
3:10  And the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl
said, “What? Has יהוה called these three sovereigns to
give them into the hand of Mo’aḇ.” 
2Kings
3:11  And Yehoshaphat said, “Is there no
prophet of יהוה here? Then let us inquire of יהוה
through him.” One of the servants of the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl then
answered and said, “Elisha son of Shaphat is here, who poured water out on the
hands of Ĕliyahu.”  
2Kings
3:12  And Yehoshaphat said, “The word of יהוה
is with him.” And the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl and Yehoshaphat and the
sovereign of Eḏom went down to him. 
2Kings
3:13  And Elisha said to the sovereign of
Yisra’ĕl, “What have I to do with you? Go to the prophets of your father
and the prophets of your mother.” And the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl said to
him, “No, for יהוה has called these three sovereigns to
give them into the hand of Mo’aḇ.” 
2Kings
3:14  And Elisha said, “As יהוה
of hosts lives, before whom I stand, if it were not that I regard the presence
of Yehoshaphat sovereign of Yehuḏah, I would not look at you nor see you.

2Kings
3:15  “And now, bring me a harpist.” And
it came to be, when the harpist played, that the hand of יהוה
came upon him. 
2Kings
3:16  And he said, “Thus said יהוה,
‘Make this wadi ditches – ditches.’ 
2Kings
3:17  “For thus said יהוה,
‘You are not going to see wind, nor rain. Yet that wadi is to be filled with
water, so that you, your cattle, and your beasts shall drink.’ 
2Kings
3:18  “And this shall be but a light
matter in the eyes of יהוה. And He shall give Mo’aḇ
into your hand. 
2Kings
3:19  “And you shall smite every walled
city and every choice city, and shall cut down every good tree, and stop up
every fountain of water, and ruin every good piece of land with stones.” 
2Kings
3:20  And it came to be in the morning,
when the grain offering was offered, that see, water came by way of Eḏom,
and the land was filled with water. 
2Kings
3:21  And when all Mo’aḇ heard that
the sovereigns had come up to fight against them, all who were able to bear
arms and older were gathered, and they stood at the border.
2Kings
3:22  And they rose up early in the
morning, and the sun was shining on the water. And the Mo’aḇites saw the
water on the other side as red as blood. 
2Kings
3:23  And they said, “This is blood. The
sovereigns have indeed struck swords and have killed one another. And now, Mo’aḇ,
to the spoil!” 
2Kings
3:24  And they came to the camp of Yisra’ĕl,
and Yisra’ĕl rose up and smote the Mo’aḇites, so that they fled
before them. And they entered their land, and smote the Mo’aḇites. 
2Kings
3:25  And they broke down the cities, and
each man threw a stone on every good piece of land and filled it. And they
stopped up all the fountains of water and cut down all the good trees, until only the stones of Qir Ḥaraseth
was left. And the slingers went round and smote it. 
2Kings
3:26  And when the sovereign of Mo’aḇ
saw that the battle was too strong for him, he took with him seven hundred men
who drew swords, to break through to the sovereign of Eḏom, but they
could not,
2Kings
3:27  then took his eldest son who would
have reigned in his place, and offered him as a burnt offering upon the wall.
And there was great wrath against Yisra’ĕl. And they left him and returned
to the land. 
2Kings
4:1  And a certain woman of the wives of
the sons of the prophets cried out to Elisha, saying, “Your servant my husband
is dead, and you know that your servant feared יהוה. And
the lender has come to take my two sons to be his slaves.” 
2Kings
4:2  And Elisha said to her, “What should
I do for you? Inform me, what do you have in the house?” And she said, “Your
female servant has none at all in the house except a pot of oil.” 
2Kings
4:3  And he said, “Go, borrow vessels
from everywhere, from all your neighbours, empty vessels, do not get a few. 
2Kings
4:4  “And when you have come in, you
shall shut the door behind you and your sons. Then pour it into all those
vessels, and set aside the filled ones.” 
2Kings
4:5  So she went from him and shut the
door behind her and her sons, who brought the
vessels to her, and she poured it out. 
2Kings
4:6  And it came to be, when the vessels
were filled, that she said to her son, “Bring me another vessel.” But he said
to her, “There is not another vessel.” And the oil ceased. 
2Kings
4:7  So she went and informed the man of
Elohim, and he said, “Go, sell the oil and pay your debt. And you and your sons live on the rest.” 
2Kings
4:8  And it came to be on a day that
Elisha went to Shunĕm, where there was a prominent woman, and she urged
him to eat some food. And it came to be, as often as he passed by, that he
turned in there to eat some food. 
2Kings
4:9  And she said to her husband, “Look,
I know that this is a set-apart man of Elohim, who passes by us continually. 
2Kings
4:10  “Please, let us make a small upper
room on the wall, and let us put a bed for him there, and a table and a chair
and a lampstand. And it shall be, whenever he comes to us, let him turn in
there.” 
2Kings
4:11  And it came to be on a day that he
came there, and he turned in to the upper room and lay down there. 
2Kings
4:12  And he said to Gĕḥazi
his servant, “Call this Shunammite woman.” So he called her, and she stood
before him. 
2Kings
4:13  And he said to him, “Please say to
her, ‘Look, you have gone to all this trouble for us. What is there to be done
for you? Should I speak on your behalf to the sovereign or to the commander of
the army?’ ” And she answered, “I am dwelling among my own people.” 
2Kings
4:14  And he said, “What then is to be
done for her?” And Gĕḥazi answered, “Well, she has no son, and her
husband is old.” 
2Kings
4:15  And he said, “Call her.” So he
called her, and she stood in the doorway. 
2Kings
4:16  And he said, “About this time next
year you shall embrace a son.” And she said, “No, my master, man of Elohim, do
not lie to your female servant!” 
2Kings
4:17  And the woman conceived, and bore a
son when the appointed time had come, of which Elisha had spoken to her. 
2Kings
4:18  And the child grew. And it came to
be on a day that he went out to his father, to the reapers, 
2Kings
4:19  and he said to his father, “My
head, my head!” And he said to a servant, “Take him to his mother.” 
2Kings
4:20  So he took him and brought him to
his mother, and he sat on her knees till noon, and died. 
2Kings
4:21  And she went up and laid him on the
bed of the man of Elohim, and shut the
door on him, and went out. 
2Kings
4:22  And she called to her husband, and
said, “Please send me one of the young men and one of the donkeys, so that I
hurry to the man of Elohim and return.” 
2Kings
4:23  And he said, “Why are you going to
him today? It is neither the New Moon nor the Sabbath.” And she said, “It is
well!” 
2Kings
4:24  And she saddled the donkey and said
to her servant, “Drive and go, do not slow down, except I speak to you.” 
2Kings
4:25  And she went, and came to the man
of Elohim at Mount Karmel. And it came to be, when the man of Elohim saw her at
a distance, that he said to his servant Gĕḥazi, “See, the Shunammite
woman. 
2Kings
4:26  “Please run now to meet her, and
say to her, ‘Is it well with you? Is it well with your husband? Is it well with
the child?’ ” And she answered, “It is well.” 
2Kings
4:27  And she came to the man of Elohim
at the hill, and she caught him by the feet, but Gĕḥazi came near to
push her away. But the man of Elohim said, “Leave her alone, for her being is
bitter in her, and יהוה has hidden it from me, and has
not revealed it to me.” 
2Kings
4:28  And she said, “Did I ask a son of
my master? Did I not say, ‘Do not deceive me’?” 
2Kings
4:29  And he said to Gĕḥazi, “Gird
up your loins, and take my staff in your hand, and go. When you meet anyone, do
not greet him, and when anyone greets you, do not answer him. And you shall lay
my staff on the face of the child.” 
2Kings
4:30  And the mother of the child said, “As
יהוה lives, and as your being lives, I do not leave
you.” And he rose and followed her. 
2Kings
4:31  And Gĕḥazi went on ahead
of them, and laid the staff on the face of the child. But there was no voice
and there was no hearing, so he went back to meet him, and reported to him,
saying, “The child has not awakened.” 
2Kings
4:32  And Elisha came into the house and
saw the child was dead, lying on his bed, 
2Kings
4:33  and he went in, and shut the door
behind the two of them, and prayed to יהוה. 
2Kings
4:34  And he went up and lay on the
child, and put his mouth on his mouth, and his eyes on his eyes, and his hands
on his hands, and stretched himself out on the child, and the flesh of the
child became warm. 
2Kings
4:35  And he returned and walked back and
forth in the house, then went up and stretched himself out on him. And the
child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes. 
2Kings
4:36  And he called Gĕḥazi and
said, “Call this Shunammite.” So he called her. And she came in to him, and he
said, “Pick up your son.” 
2Kings
4:37  Then she went in and fell at his
feet, and bowed herself to the ground, and picked up her son and went out. 
2Kings
4:38  And Elisha returned to Gilgal. And
the scarcity of food was in the land, and the sons of the prophets were sitting
before him. And he said to his servant, “Put on the large pot, and cook stew
for the sons of the prophets.” 
2Kings
4:39  And one went out to the field to
gather plants, and found a wild vine, and gathered wild cucumbers from it,
filling the skirt of his garment, and came and sliced them into the pot of
stew, though they did not know what they were. 
2Kings
4:40  They then served it to the men to
eat. And it came to be, as they were eating the stew, that they cried out and
said, “O man of Elohim, there is death in the pot!” And they were unable to eat
it. 
2Kings
4:41  And he said, “Then bring some flour.”
And he put it into the pot, and said, “Serve it to the people to eat.” And
there was no evil matter in the pot. 
2Kings
4:42  Now a man came from Ba‛al
Shalishah, and brought the man of Elohim bread of the first-fruits, twenty
loaves of barley bread, and newly ripened grain in his knapsack. And he said, “Give
it to the people to eat.” 
2Kings
4:43  And his servant said, “What? Do I
set this before one hundred men?” And he said, “Give it to the people to eat.
For thus said יהוה, ‘Eat and have some left over.’ ” 
2Kings
4:44  And he set it before them, and they
ate and had some left over, according to the word of יהוה.

2Kings
5:1  And Na‛aman, commander of the
army of the sovereign of Aram, was a great man in the eyes of his master, and
highly respected, because by him יהוה had given
deliverance to Aram. And he was a brave man, but leprous. 
2Kings
5:2  And the Arameans had gone out on
raids, and had brought back captive a young girl from the land of Yisra’ĕl,
and she served the wife of Na‛aman. 
2Kings
5:3  And she said to her mistress, “If
only my master were with the prophet who is in Shomeron! Then he would recover
him of his leprosy.” 
2Kings
5:4  And Na‛aman went in and
reported to his master, saying, “Thus and thus spoke the girl who is from the
land of Yisra’ĕl.” 
2Kings
5:5  And the sovereign of Aram said, “Go,
enter, and let me send a letter to the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl.” And he went
and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of garments. 
2Kings
5:6  And he brought the letter to the
sovereign of Yisra’ĕl, which said, “And now, when this letter comes to
you, see I have sent Na‛aman my servant to you, so that you shall recover
him of his leprosy.” 
2Kings
5:7  And it came to be, when the
sovereign of Yisra’ĕl read the letter, that he tore his garments and said,
“Am I Elohim, to kill and keep alive, that this man sends a man to me to
recover him of his leprosy? For consider now, and see how he is seeking an
occasion with me!” 
2Kings
5:8  And it came to be, when Elisha the
man of Elohim heard that the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl had torn his garments,
that he sent to the sovereign, saying, “Why have you torn your garments? Please
let him come to me, so that he knows that there is a prophet in Yisra’ĕl.”

2Kings
5:9  So Na‛aman came with his
horses and chariot, and he stood at the entrance of the house of Elisha. 
2Kings
5:10  And Elisha sent a messenger to him,
saying, “Go, and you shall wash seven times in the Yardĕn, that your flesh
might be restored to you, and be clean.” 
2Kings
5:11  But Na‛aman became wroth, and
went away and said, “See, I said to myself, ‘He would certainly come out to me,
and stand and call on the Name of יהוה his Elohim, and
wave his hand over the place, and recover the leprosy.’ 
2Kings
5:12  “Are not the Aḇanah and the
Pharpar, the rivers of Dammeseq, better than all the waters of Yisra’ĕl?
Could I not wash in them and be clean?” And he turned and went away in a rage. 
2Kings
5:13  And his servants came near and
spoke to him, and said, “My father, if the prophet had spoken to you a great
matter, would you not have done it? How much more then, when he says to you, ‘Wash,
and be clean’?” 
2Kings
5:14  Then he went down and dipped seven
times in the Yardĕn, according to the word of the man of Elohim. And his
flesh was restored like the flesh of a little child, and he was clean. 
2Kings
5:15  And he returned to the man of
Elohim, he and all his company, and came and stood before him and said, “See,
now I know that there is no Elohim in all the earth, except in Yisra’ĕl.
And now, please take a gift from your servant.” 
2Kings
5:16  But he said, “As יהוה
lives, before whom I stand, I do not accept it.” And he pressed on him to
accept it, but he refused. 
2Kings
5:17  Then Na‛aman said, “If not,
please let your servant be given two mule-loads of earth, for no longer is your
servant going to make a burnt offering and slaughtering to other mighty ones,
but to יהוה. 
2Kings
5:18  “ יהוה
grant forgiveness to your servant in this matter: when my master goes into the
house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leans on my hand, and I bow down in
the house of Rimmon; when I bow down in the house of Rimmon, יהוה,
please grant forgiveness to your servant in this matter.” 
2Kings
5:19  Then he said to him, “Go in peace.”
And when he had gone from him some distance, 
2Kings
5:20  But Gĕḥazi, the servant
of Elisha the man of Elohim, said to
himself, “Look, my master has spared Na‛aman this Aramean, while not
receiving from his hands what he brought. But as יהוה
lives, I shall run after him and take whatever from him.” 
2Kings
5:21  And Gĕḥazi pursued Na‛aman.
And when Na‛aman saw him running after him, he came down from the chariot
to meet him, and said, “Is there peace?” 
2Kings
5:22  And he said, “Peace. My master has
sent me, saying, ‘Look, even now two young men of the sons of the prophets have
come to me from the mountains of Ephrayim. Please give them a talent of silver
and two changes of garments.’ ” 
2Kings
5:23  And Na‛aman said, “Please
accept two talents.” And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two
bags, with two changes of garments, and handed them to two of his servants. And
they bare them ahead of him. 
2Kings
5:24  And when he came to the high place,
he took them from their hand, and stored them away in the house, and let the
men go, and they went. 
2Kings
5:25  And he went in and stood before his
master, and Elisha said to him, “Where did you go, Gĕḥazi?” And he
said, “Your servant did not go anywhere.”
2Kings
5:26  But he said to him, “Did not my
heart go with you when the man turned back from his chariot to meet you? Is it
time to accept silver and to accept garments, and olive-trees and vineyards,
and sheep and cattle, and male and female servants? 
2Kings
5:27  “So let the leprosy of Na‛aman
cling to you and your descendants forever.” And he went out from him as leprous
as snow. 
2Kings
6:1  And the sons of the prophets said to
Elisha, “See, the place where we dwell with you is too small for us. 
2Kings
6:2  “Please, let us go to the Yardĕn,
and let every man take a log from there, and let us make there a place to
dwell.” And he answered, “Go.” 
2Kings
6:3  Then the one said, “Please undertake
to go with your servants.” And he answered, “I shall go.” 
2Kings
6:4  And he went with them, and they came
to the Yardĕn, and they cut down trees. 
2Kings
6:5  And it came to be, as one was
cutting down a tree, that the iron axe head fell into the water. And he cried
out and said, “Oh my master, for it was borrowed!” 
2Kings
6:6  And the man of Elohim said, “Where
did it fall?” And he showed him the place. And he cut off a stick, and threw it
in there, and made the iron float. 
2Kings
6:7  And he said, “Pick it up.” And he
reached out his hand and took it. 
2Kings
6:8  And the sovereign of Aram was
fighting against Yisra’ĕl, and took counsel with his servants, saying, “My
camp is in such and such a place.” 
2Kings
6:9  And the man of Elohim sent to the
sovereign of Yisra’ĕl, saying, “Be on guard, do not pass this place, for
the Arameans are coming down there.” 
2Kings
6:10  The sovereign of Yisra’ĕl then
sent to the place of which the man of Elohim had spoken to him, and warned him,
so that he was on his guard there, not once, and not twice. 
2Kings
6:11  And this greatly troubled the heart
of the sovereign of Aram. And he called his servants and said to them, “Declare
to me! Who of us is for the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl?”
2Kings
6:12  And one of his servants said, “None,
my master, O sovereign, for Elisha, the prophet who is in Yisra’ĕl,
declares to the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl the words that you speak in your
bedroom.” 
2Kings
6:13  And he said, “Go and see where he
is, so that I send and get him.” And it was reported to him, saying, “See, he
is in Dothan.” 
2Kings
6:14  And he sent horses and chariots and
a great army there, and they came by night and surrounded the city. 
2Kings
6:15  And the servant of the man of
Elohim rose early and went out, and saw an army, surrounding the city with
horses and chariots. And his servant said to him, “Oh, my master! What do we
do?” 
2Kings
6:16  And he answered, “Do not fear, for
those who are with us are more than those who are with them.” 
2Kings
6:17  And Elisha prayed, and said, “ יהוה,
I pray, open his eyes and let him see.” And יהוה opened
the eyes of the young man, and he looked and saw the mountain covered with
horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.
2Kings
6:18  And when they came down to him,
Elisha prayed to יהוה, and said, “Strike this nation
with blindness, I pray.” And He struck them with blindness according to the
word of Elisha. 
2Kings
6:19  And Elisha said to them, “This is
not the way, nor is this the city. Follow me, and let me bring you to the man
whom you seek.” But he led them to Shomeron. 
2Kings
6:20  And it came to be, when they had
come to Shomeron, that Elisha said, “ יהוה, open the
eyes of these men so that they see.” And יהוה opened
their eyes, and they looked and saw they were in the midst of Shomeron! 
2Kings
6:21  And when the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl
saw them, he said to Elisha, “My father, should I smite? Should I smite?” 
2Kings
6:22  But he said, “Do not smite. Do you
smite those whom you have taken captive with your sword and your bow? Set food
and water before them and let them eat and drink and go to their master.” 
2Kings
6:23  And he made a great feast for them.
And after they ate and drank, he let them go, and they went to their master.
And the bands of Aramean raiders came no more into the land of Yisra’ĕl. 
2Kings
6:24  And after this it came to be that
Ben-Haḏaḏ the sovereign of Aram mustered all his army, and went up
and besieged Shomeron. 
2Kings
6:25  And there was a great scarcity of
food in Shomeron. And see, they besieged it until a donkey’s head went at
eighty pieces of silver, and one-fourth of a kab of dove droppings for five
pieces of silver. 
2Kings
6:26  And it came to be, as the sovereign
of Yisra’ĕl was passing by on the wall, a woman cried out to him, saying, “Help,
my master, O sovereign!” 
2Kings
6:27  And he said, “If יהוה
does not help you, where do I find help for you? From the threshing floor or
from the winepress?” 
2Kings
6:28  And the sovereign said to her, “What
is troubling you?” And she answered, “This woman said to me, ‘Give your son and
let us eat him today, and tomorrow we eat my son.’ 
2Kings
6:29  “So we cooked my son, and ate him.
And I said to her on the next day, ‘Give your son and let us eat him.’ But she
has hidden her son.” 
2Kings
6:30  And it came to be, when the
sovereign heard the words of the woman, that he tore his garments. And as he
passed by on the wall, the people looked and saw the sackcloth on his body,
underneath. 
2Kings
6:31  And he said, “Elohim do so to me
and more also, if the head of Elisha son of Shaphat remains on him today.” 
2Kings
6:32  And Elisha was sitting in his
house, and the elders were sitting with him. And the sovereign sent a man ahead of him, but before the messenger
came to him, he said to the elders, “Do you see how this son of a murderer has
sent someone to take away my head? Look, when the messenger comes, shut the
door, and hold him fast at the door. Is not the sound of his master’s feet
behind him?” 
2Kings
6:33  While he was still speaking with
them, then see, the messenger came down to him, and he said, “Look, this evil
is from יהוה, why should I wait for יהוה
any longer?” 
2Kings
7:1  And Elisha said, “Hear the word of יהוה.
Thus said יהוה, ‘About this time tomorrow a seah of
fine flour for a sheqel, and two seahs of barley for a sheqel, at the gate of
Shomeron.’ ” 
2Kings
7:2  And an officer on whose hand the
sovereign leaned answered the man of Elohim and said, “Look, if יהוה
is making windows in the heavens, shall this word come true?” And he said, “Look,
you are about to see it with your eyes, but not eat of it.” 
2Kings
7:3  And there were four leprous men at
the entrance of the gate. And they said to each other, “Why are we sitting here
until we are dead? 
2Kings
7:4  “If we shall say, ‘Let us go into
the city,’ the scarcity of food is in the city, and we shall die there. And if
we sit here, we shall die. And now, come, let us surrender to the army of the
Arameans. If they keep us alive, we live. And if they kill us, we shall die.” 
2Kings
7:5  So at twilight they rose up to go to
the camp of the Arameans. And when they had come to the outskirts of the
Aramean camp, look, no one was there. 
2Kings
7:6  For יהוה had
caused the army of the Arameans to hear the noise of chariots and the noise of
horses, the noise of a great army, and they said to each other, “Look, the
sovereign of Yisra’ĕl has hired against us the sovereigns of the Ḥittites
and the sovereigns of the Mitsrians to come against us!” 
2Kings
7:7  So they rose up and fled at
twilight, and left the camp as it is – their tents, and their horses, and their
donkeys – and they fled for their lives. 
2Kings
7:8  And when these lepers came to the
outskirts of the camp, they went into one tent and ate and drank, and took from
there silver and gold and garments, and went and hid them. And they came back
and went into another tent, and took from there and went and hid it. 
2Kings
7:9  Then they said to each other, “We
are not doing right. This day is a day of good news, and we are keeping silent.
And if we wait until morning light, then evil shall come upon us. And now,
come, let us go and inform the house of the sovereign.” 
2Kings
7:10  And they came and called to the
gatekeepers of the city, and informed them, saying, “We went to the camp of
Aram, and look, there is not a man or a voice of man, only horses tied and
donkeys tied, and the tents as they were.” 
2Kings
7:11  And the gatekeepers called, and
they informed the house of the sovereign inside. 
2Kings
7:12  So the sovereign rose up in the
night and said to his servants, “Let me now inform you what the Arameans have
done to us. They know that we are starving, so they have gone out of the camp
to hide themselves in the field, saying, ‘When they come out of the city, we
shall catch them alive, and enter into the city.’ ” 
2Kings
7:13  And one of his servants answered
and said, “Please, let some take five of the horses that are left in the city.
Look, they are like the entire crowd of Yisra’ĕl that are left in it,
look, they are like the entire crowd of Yisra’ĕl left from those who are
consumed. So let us send and see.” 
2Kings
7:14  They then took two chariots with
horses. And the sovereign sent them in the direction of the camp of Aram,
saying, “Go and see.” 
2Kings
7:15  And they went after them to the
Yardĕn. And look, all the way was littered with garments and weapons which
the Arameans had thrown away in their haste. And the messengers returned and
reported to the sovereign. 
2Kings
7:16  Then the people went out and
plundered the camp of Aram. So a seah of fine flour was for a sheqel, and two
seahs of barley for a sheqel, according to the word of יהוה.

2Kings
7:17  And the sovereign had appointed the
officer on whose hand he leaned to be in charge of the gate. But the people
trampled him in the gate, and he died, as the man of Elohim had said, who spoke
when the sovereign came down to him. 
2Kings
7:18  And it came to be, as the man of
Elohim had spoken to the sovereign, saying, “Two seahs of barley for a sheqel,
and a seah of fine flour for a sheqel, at this time tomorrow in the gate of
Shomeron,” 
2Kings
7:19  that officer answered the man of
Elohim, and said, “Now look, if יהוה is making windows
in the heavens, is it according to this word?” And he had said, “Look, you are
about to see it with your eyes, but not eat of it.” 
2Kings
7:20  And so it came to be for him, for
the people trampled him in the gate, and he died. 
2Kings
8:1  And Elisha spoke to the woman whose
son he had restored to life, saying, “Rise up and go, you and your household,
and sojourn wherever you do sojourn, for יהוה has
called for a scarcity of food, and also, it is coming upon the land for seven
years.” 
2Kings
8:2  And the woman rose up and did
according to the word of the man of Elohim, and she went with her household and
sojourned in the land of the Philistines, seven years. 
2Kings
8:3  And it came to be, at the end of
seven years, that the woman returned from the land of the Philistines. And she
went to cry out to the sovereign for her house and for her land. 
2Kings
8:4  And the sovereign was speaking to Gĕḥazi,
the servant of the man of Elohim, saying, “Please relate to me all the great
matters Elisha has done.” 
2Kings
8:5  And it came to be, as he was
relating to the sovereign how he had restored the dead to life, that see, the
woman whose son he had restored to life, was crying out to the sovereign for
her house and for her land. And Gĕḥazi said, “My master, O
sovereign, this is the woman, and this is her son whom Elisha restored to life.”

2Kings
8:6  So the sovereign asked the woman,
and she related to him. And the sovereign appointed a certain eunuch for her,
saying, “Return all that was hers, and all the increase of the field from the
day that she left the land until now.” 
2Kings
8:7  And Elisha came to Dammeseq, and
Ben-Haḏaḏ sovereign of Aram was sick. And it was reported to him,
saying, “The man of Elohim has come here.” 
2Kings
8:8  And the sovereign said to Ḥaza’ĕl,
“Take a present in your hand, and go to meet the man of Elohim, and inquire of יהוה
by him, saying, ‘Do I recover from this sickness?’ ” 
2Kings
8:9  And Ḥaza’ĕl went to meet
him and took a present with him, of all the good wares of Dammeseq, forty camel-loads. And he came and stood before
him, and said, “Your son Ben-Haḏaḏ sovereign of Aram has sent me to
you, saying, ‘Do I recover from this sickness?’ ” 
2Kings
8:10  And Elisha said to him, “Go, say to
him, ‘You shall certainly recover.’ But יהוה has shown
me that he shall certainly die.” 
2Kings
8:11  And he looked at him steadily until he was ashamed. Then the man of Elohim wept. 
2Kings
8:12  And Ḥaza’ĕl said, “Why
is my master weeping?” And he answered, “Because I know the evil that you are
going to do to the children of Yisra’ĕl: Setting their strongholds on
fire, and slaying their young men with the sword, and dashing their children,
and ripping open their women with child.” 
2Kings
8:13  And Ḥaza’ĕl said, “But
what is your servant – a dog, that he should perform this great matter?” And
Elisha answered, “ יהוה has shown that you are to be
sovereign over Aram!”
2Kings
8:14  And he left Elisha, and came to his
master, who said to him, “What did Elisha say to you?” And he answered, “He
said to me that you shall certainly recover.” 
2Kings
8:15  And on the next day it came to be
that he took a thick cloth and dipped it in water, and spread it over his face
so that he died. And Ḥaza’ĕl reigned in his place. 
2Kings
8:16  And in the fifth year of Yehoram
son of Aḥaḇ sovereign of Yisra’ĕl – Yehoshaphat was sovereign
of Yehuḏah – Yehoram son of Yehoshaphat began to reign as sovereign of
Yehuḏah. 
2Kings
8:17  He was thirty-two years old when he
began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Yerushalayim. 
2Kings
8:18  And he walked in the way of the
sovereigns of Yisra’ĕl, as the house of Aḥaḇ had done, for the
daughter of Aḥaḇ was his wife. And he did evil in the eyes of יהוה.

2Kings
8:19  However, יהוה
would not destroy Yehuḏah, for the sake of Dawiḏ His servant, as He
promised him to give a lamp to him and his sons forever. 
2Kings
8:20  In his days Eḏom revolted
from under the hand of Yehuḏah, and made a sovereign over themselves. 
2Kings
8:21  And Yoram passed over to Tsa‛ir,
and all his chariots with him. And he rose by night and smote the Eḏomites
who had surrounded him and the commanders of the chariots, but his people fled
to their tents. 
2Kings
8:22  Yet Eḏom has been in revolt
from under the hand of Yehuḏah to this day. Then Liḇnah revolted at
the same time. 
2Kings
8:23  And the rest of the acts of Yoram,
and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the
sovereigns of Yehuḏah? 
2Kings
8:24  So Yoram slept with his fathers,
and was buried with his fathers in the City of Dawiḏ. And Aḥazyahu
his son reigned in his place. 
2Kings
8:25  In the twelfth year of Yoram son of
Aḥaḇ sovereign of Yisra’ĕl, Aḥazyahu son of Yehoram
sovereign of Yehuḏah began to reign. 
2Kings
8:26  Aḥazyahu was twenty-two years
old when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Yerushalayim. And the
name of his mother was Athalyahu, the granddaughter of Omri, sovereign of Yisra’ĕl.

2Kings
8:27  And he walked in the way of the
house of Aḥaḇ, and did evil in the eyes of יהוה,
as the house of Aḥaḇ had done, for he was the son-in-law of the
house of Aḥaḇ. 
2Kings
8:28  And he went with Yoram son of
Aḥaḇ to battle against Ḥaza’ĕl sovereign of Aram at
Ramoth Gil‛aḏ, and the Arameans smote Yoram. 
2Kings
8:29  And Sovereign Yoram went back to
Yizre‛ĕl to recover from the wounds with which the Arameans had
smitten him at Ramah, when he fought against Ḥaza’ĕl sovereign of
Aram. Then Aḥazyahu son of Yehoram, the sovereign of Yehuḏah, went
down to see Yoram son of Aḥaḇ in Yizre‛ĕl, for he was
sick. 
2Kings
9:1  And Elisha the prophet called one of
the sons of the prophets, and said to him, “Gird your loins and take this flask
of oil in your hand, and go to Ramoth Gil‛aḏ. 
2Kings
9:2  “And you shall go there and look
there for Yĕhu son of Yehoshaphat, son of Nimshi, and go in and make him
rise up from among his brothers, and take him to an inner room, 
2Kings
9:3  “and take the flask of oil, and pour
it on his head, and say, ‘Thus said יהוה, “I have
anointed you sovereign over Yisra’ĕl.” ’ Then you shall open the door and
flee, and do not wait.” 
2Kings
9:4  So the young man – the young man the
prophet – went to Ramoth Gil‛aḏ, 
2Kings
9:5  and came in and saw the commanders
of the army sitting. And he said, “I have a message for you, O commander.” And
Yĕhu said, “For which one of us?” And he said, “For you, commander.” 
2Kings
9:6  And he rose up and went into the
house. And he poured the oil on his head, and said to him, “Thus said יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, ‘I have anointed you sovereign over the people of יהוה,
over Yisra’ĕl. 
2Kings
9:7  ‘And you shall smite the house of
Aḥaḇ your master, and I shall avenge the blood of My servants the
prophets, and the blood of all the servants of יהוה, at
the hand of Izeḇel. 
2Kings
9:8  ‘And all the house of Aḥaḇ
shall perish. And I shall cut off from Aḥaḇ all the males in Yisra’ĕl,
both those shut up and those left at large. 
2Kings
9:9  ‘And I shall give up the house of
Aḥaḇ like the house of Yaroḇ‛am son of Neḇat, and
like the house of Ba‛asha son of Aḥiyah. 
2Kings
9:10  ‘And the dogs are going to eat Izeḇel
in the portion of Yizre‛ĕl, with none to bury her.’ ” Then he opened
the door and fled. 
2Kings
9:11  And Yĕhu came out to the
servants of his master, and one said to him, “Is there peace? Why did this
madman come to you?” And he said to them, “You know the man and his talk.” 
2Kings
9:12  And they said, “A lie! Reveal it to
us now.” So he said, “Thus and thus he spoke to me, saying, ‘Thus said יהוה,
“I have anointed you sovereign over Yisra’ĕl.” ’ ” 
2Kings
9:13  And they hurried, and each one took
his garment and put it under him on the top of the steps. And they blew a ram’s
horn, saying, “Yĕhu reigns!” 
2Kings
9:14  Thus Yĕhu son of Yehoshaphat,
son of Nimshi, conspired against Yoram – now Yoram had been guarding Ramoth Gil‛aḏ,
he and all Yisra’ĕl, against Ḥaza’ĕl sovereign of Aram. 
2Kings
9:15  But Sovereign Yehoram had returned
to Yizre‛ĕl to recover from the wounds with which the Arameans had
smitten him when he fought with Ḥaza’ĕl sovereign of Aram – Yĕhu
now said, “If this is your desire, let no one leave or escape from the city to
go and make it known in Yizre‛ĕl!” 
2Kings
9:16  And Yĕhu rode in a chariot and
went to Yizre‛ĕl, for Yoram was laid up there. And Aḥazyah
sovereign of Yehuḏah had come down to see Yoram. 
2Kings
9:17  And a watchman stood on the tower
in Yizre‛ĕl, and he saw the company of Yĕhu as he came, and
said, “I see a company of men.” And Yehoram said, “Get a horseman and send him
to meet them, and let him say, ‘Is there peace?’ ” 
2Kings
9:18  And the horseman went to meet him,
and said, “Thus said the sovereign, ‘Is there peace?’ ” And Yĕhu said, “What
have you to do with peace? Turn around and follow me.” And the watchman spoke,
saying, “The messenger went to them, but is not coming back.” 
2Kings
9:19  Then he sent out a second horseman
who came to them, and said, “Thus said the sovereign, ‘Is there peace?’ ” And Yĕhu
answered, “What have you to do with peace? Turn around and follow me.” 
2Kings
9:20  And the watchman spoke, saying, “He
went up to them and is not coming back. And the driving is like the driving of
Yĕhu son of Nimshi, for he drives madly!” 
2Kings
9:21  Then Yehoram said, “Hitch up.” And
his chariot was hitched up. And Yehoram sovereign of Yisra’ĕl and
Aḥazyahu sovereign of Yehuḏah went out, each in his chariot. And
they went out to meet Yĕhu, and met him on the portion of Naḇoth the
Yizre‛ĕlite. 
2Kings
9:22  And it came to be, when Yehoram saw
Yĕhu, that he said, “Is there peace, Yĕhu?” But he answered, “What
peace, as long as the whorings of your mother Izeḇel and her witchcraft
are so many?” 
2Kings
9:23  Thereupon Yehoram turned his hands
around and fled, and said to Aḥazyahu, “Treachery, O Aḥazyah!” 
2Kings
9:24  And Yĕhu drew his bow and shot
Yehoram between his arms. And the arrow came out at his heart, and he sank down
in his chariot. 
2Kings
9:25  And Yĕhu said to Biḏqar his officer, “Take him up, and throw
him into the portion of the field of Naḇoth the Yizre‛ĕlite.
Remember how you and I were riding together behind Aḥaḇ his father,
and יהוה lifted up this pronouncement against him: 
2Kings
9:26  ‘Have I not seen the blood of Naḇoth
and the blood of his sons last night?’ declares יהוה. ‘And
I shall repay you in this portion,’ declares יהוה. And
now, take up, throw him on the portion, according to the word of יהוה.”
2Kings
9:27  And Aḥazyah sovereign of Yehuḏah
saw this and fled up the way to Bĕyth Haggan. And Yĕhu pursued him,
and said, “Smite him, him too, in the chariot,” at the ascent to Gur, which is
by Yiḇle‛am. And he fled to Meḡiddo, and died there. 
2Kings
9:28  Then his servants conveyed him in
the chariot to Yerushalayim, and buried him in his tomb with his fathers in the
City of Dawiḏ. 
2Kings
9:29  And in the eleventh year of Yoram
son of Aḥaḇ, Aḥazyah began to reign over Yehuḏah. 
2Kings
9:30  And Yĕhu came to Yizre‛ĕl,
and Izeḇel heard of it. And she put paint on her eyes and adorned her
head, and looked through a window. 
2Kings
9:31  And as Yĕhu came to the gate,
she said, “Is it peace, Zimri, slayer of your master?” 
2Kings
9:32  And he lifted up his face to the
window and said, “Who is with me? Who?” And two, three eunuchs looked down to
him. 
2Kings
9:33  And he said, “Throw her down.” And
they threw her down, and some of her blood spattered on the wall and on the
horses, and he trampled her under foot. 
2Kings
9:34  And he went in, and he ate and
drank, and said, “Go now, see to this cursed one, and bury her, for she was a
sovereign’s daughter.” 
2Kings
9:35  So they went to bury her, but all
they found of her was the skull and the feet and the palms of the hands. 
2Kings
9:36  And they came back and informed
him. And he said, “This is the word of יהוה, which He
spoke by His servant Ĕliyahu the Tishbite, saying, ‘In the portion of
Yizre‛ĕl dogs are going to eat the flesh of Izeḇel, 
2Kings
9:37  and the corpse of Izeḇel
shall be as dung on the surface of the field, in the portion of Yizre‛ĕl,
so that they do not say, “This is Izeḇel.” ’ ” 
2Kings
10:1  And Aḥaḇ had seventy
sons in Shomeron. And Yĕhu wrote letters and sent to Shomeron, to the
rulers of Yizre‛ĕl, to the elders, and to the guardians of Aḥaḇ,
saying, 
2Kings
10:2  And now, when this letter comes to
you, since your master’s sons are with you, and you have chariots and horses,
and a walled city, and weapons, 
2Kings
10:3  choose the best and most upright of
your master’s sons, and set him on his father’s throne, and fight for your
master’s house. 
2Kings
10:4  And they were greatly afraid, and
said, “Look, two sovereigns have not stood before him, how do we stand, we?” 
2Kings
10:5  And he who was over the house, and
he who was over the city, the elders also, and the guardians, sent to Yĕhu,
saying, “We are your servants, and all that you say to us we do. We do not set
up anyone to reign. Do what is good in your eyes.” 
2Kings
10:6  And he wrote a second letter to
them, saying, If you are for me, and if you obey my voice, take the heads of
the men, your master’s sons, and come to me at Yizre‛ĕl by this time
tomorrow. Now the sovereign’s sons, seventy beings, were with the great men of
the city, who brought them up. 
2Kings
10:7  And it came to be, when the letter
came to them, that they took the sovereign’s sons and slaughtered them, seventy
men, and put their heads in baskets and sent them to him at Yizre‛ĕl.

2Kings
10:8  Then a messenger came and informed
him, saying, “They have brought the heads of the sovereign’s sons.” And he
said, “Make them two heaps at the entrance of the gate until morning.” 
2Kings
10:9  And it came to be, in the morning,
that he went out and stood, and said to all the people, “You are righteous.
Look, I conspired against my master and slew him, but who smote all these? 
2Kings
10:10  “Know now that not one word of יהוה
which יהוה spoke concerning the house of Aḥaḇ
does fall to the ground, for יהוה has done what He
spoke by His servant Ĕliyahu.” 
2Kings
10:11  And Yĕhu smote all those left
of the house of Aḥaḇ in Yizre‛ĕl, and all his great men
and his friends and his priests, until he left him without a survivor. 
2Kings
10:12  And he rose up to go, and went to
Shomeron. On the way, at Bĕyth Ĕqeḏ of the Shepherds, 
2Kings
10:13  Yĕhu met the brothers of
Aḥazyahu sovereign of Yehuḏah, and said, “Who are you?” And they
answered, “We are brothers of Aḥazyahu, and we have come down to greet
the sons of the sovereign and the sons of the sovereigness mother.” 
2Kings
10:14  And he said, “Take them alive!” So
they took them alive, and slew them at the well of Bĕyth Ĕqeḏ,
forty-two men, and he left none of them. 
2Kings
10:15  And he left there and met Yehonaḏaḇ
son of Rĕḵaḇ, coming to meet him, and blessed him and said to
him, “Is your heart right, as my heart is toward your heart?” And Yehonaḏaḇ
answered, “It is.” Yĕhu said, “If
it is, give me your hand.” And he gave him his hand, and he took him up to him
into the chariot. 
2Kings
10:16  And he said, “Come with me, and
see my ardour for יהוה.” And they made him ride in his
chariot. 
2Kings
10:17  And he came to Shomeron, and smote
all those left of Aḥaḇ in Shomeron, till he had destroyed them,
according to the word of יהוה which He spoke to Ĕliyahu.

2Kings
10:18  And Yĕhu gathered all the
people and said to them, “Aḥaḇ served Ba‛al a little; Yĕhu
serves him much. 
2Kings
10:19  “And now, call to me all the
prophets of Ba‛al, all his servants, and all his priests. Let no one be
missing, for I have a great slaughtering to make to Ba‛al. Anyone who is
lacking shall not live!” But Yĕhu did this deceptively, in order to
destroy the servants of Ba‛al. 
2Kings
10:20  And Yĕhu said, “Set apart an
assembly for Ba‛al.” So they proclaimed it. 
2Kings
10:21  And Yĕhu sent throughout all
Yisra’ĕl, and all the servants of Ba‛al came, so that there was not
a man left who did not come. And they came into the house of Ba‛al, and
the house of Ba‛al was filled from end to end.
2Kings
10:22  And he said to him who was over
the wardrobe, “Bring out garments for all the servants of Ba‛al.” And he
brought out garments for them. 
2Kings
10:23  And Yĕhu and Yehonaḏaḇ
son of Rĕḵaḇ went into the house of Ba‛al, and said to
the servants of Ba‛al, “Search and see that no servants of יהוה
are here with you, but only the servants of Ba‛al.” 
2Kings
10:24  So they went in to make offerings
and burnt offerings. Now Yĕhu had appointed for himself eighty men on the
outside, and had said, “The man who lets escape any of the men whom I have brought into your hands – his life for
his life!” 
2Kings
10:25  And it came to be, when he had
finished making the burnt offering, Yĕhu said to the guard and to the
officers, “Go in, smite them, let no one come out!” And they smote them with
the edge of the sword, and the guards and the officers threw them out, and went
into the inner room of the house of Ba‛al, 
2Kings
10:26  and brought out the pillars of the
house of Ba‛al and burned them, 
2Kings
10:27  and broke down the statue of Ba‛al,
and broke down the house of Ba‛al and made it a latrine to this day. 
2Kings
10:28  Thus Yĕhu destroyed Ba‛al
out of Yisra’ĕl. 
2Kings
10:29  However, Yĕhu did not turn
away from the sins of Yaroḇ‛am son of Neḇat, who had made
Yisra’ĕl sin, from the golden calves that were at Bĕyth Ĕl and
Dan. 
2Kings
10:30  And יהוה
said to Yĕhu, “Because you have done well by doing what is right in My
eyes, and have done to the house of Aḥaḇ all that was in My heart,
your sons are going to sit on the throne of Yisra’ĕl to the fourth
generation.” 
2Kings
10:31  But Yĕhu did not guard to
walk in the Torah of יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl with
all his heart. For he did not turn away from the sins of Yaroḇ‛am,
who had made Yisra’ĕl sin. 
2Kings
10:32  In those days יהוה
began to cut off some in Yisra’ĕl. And Ḥaza’ĕl smote them
throughout all the border of Yisra’ĕl, 
2Kings
10:33  from the Yardĕn to the
sun-rising: all the land of Gil‛aḏ – the Gaḏites, and the Re’uḇĕnites,
and the Menashshehites – from Aro‛ĕr, which is by the wadi Arnon, including
Gil‛aḏ and Bashan. 
2Kings
10:34  And the rest of the acts of Yĕhu,
and all that he did, and all his might, are they not written in the book of the
annals of the sovereigns of Yisra’ĕl? 
2Kings
10:35  So Yĕhu slept with his
fathers, and they buried him in Shomeron. And Yeho’aḥaz his son reigned
in his place. 
2Kings
10:36  And the days that Yĕhu
reigned over Yisra’ĕl in Shomeron were twenty-eight years. 
2Kings
11:1  And Athalyah was the mother of
Aḥazyahu. And when she saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed
all the offspring of the reign. 
2Kings
11:2  But Yehosheḇa, the daughter
of Sovereign Yoram, sister of Aḥazyahu, took Yo’ash son of Aḥazyah,
and stole him away from among the sons of the sovereign’s sons who were put to
death. So they hid him and his nurse in the bedroom, from Athalyahu, and he was
not put to death. 
2Kings
11:3  And he remained with her in hiding
in the House of יהוה for six years, while Athalyah was
reigning over the land. 
2Kings
11:4  And in the seventh year Yehoyaḏa
sent and brought the commanders of hundreds, with the Karites and the runners,
and brought them into the House of יהוה to him. And he
made a covenant with them and took an oath from them in the House of יהוה,
and showed them the son of the sovereign. 
2Kings
11:5  And he commanded them, saying, “This
is what you are to do: One-third of you who come in on the Sabbath to be on
guard in the sovereign’s house, 
2Kings
11:6  and one-third at the gate of Sur,
and one-third at the gate behind the runners. And you shall be on guard in the
house, lest it be broken down. 
2Kings
11:7  “And the two detachments of you who
are going out on the Sabbath shall be on guard in the House of יהוה
for the sovereign.
2Kings
11:8  “And you shall surround the
sovereign on all sides, every man with his weapons in his hand. And whoever
comes within the ranks, let him be put to death. And be with the sovereign as
he goes out and as he comes in.” 
2Kings
11:9  So the commanders of the hundreds
did according to all that Yehoyaḏa the priest commanded. And each of them
took his men who were going in on the Sabbath, with those who were going out on
the Sabbath, and came to Yehoyaḏa the priest. 
2Kings
11:10  And the priest gave the commanders
of hundreds the spears and shields which had belonged to Sovereign Dawiḏ,
that were in the House of יהוה.
2Kings
11:11  And the runners stood, every man
with his weapons in his hand, all around the sovereign, from the right side of
the House to the left side of the House, by the altar and the House. 
2Kings
11:12  And he brought out the son of the
sovereign and put on him the diadem and the Witness. And they set him up to
reign and anointed him, and they clapped their hands and said, “Let the
sovereign live!” 
2Kings
11:13  And Athalyah heard the noise of
the runners, the people, and she came to the people, into the House of יהוה,

2Kings
11:14  and looked and saw the sovereign
standing by a column, according to the ruling, and the chiefs and the
trumpeters were beside the sovereign, and all the people of the land rejoicing
and blowing trumpets. And Athalyah tore her garments and cried out, “Treason!
Treason!” 
2Kings
11:15  And Yehoyaḏa the priest
commanded the commanders of the hundreds, the officers of the army, and said to
them, “Take her outside the ranks, and slay with the sword whoever follows her.”
For the priest had said, “Do not let her be killed in the House of יהוה.”

2Kings
11:16  So they took hold of her, and she
went by way of the horses’ entrance to the sovereign’s house, and was put to
death there. 
2Kings
11:17  And Yehoyaḏa made a covenant
between יהוה and the sovereign and the people, to be
the people of יהוה – also between the sovereign and the
people. 
2Kings
11:18  And all the people of the land
went to the house of Ba‛al, and broke it down. They completely broke up
its altars and images, and slew Mattan the priest of Ba‛al before the
altars. And the priest appointed inspectors over the House of יהוה,

2Kings
11:19  and took the commanders of
hundreds, and the Karites, and the runners, and all the people of the land. And
they brought the sovereign down from the House of יהוה,
and went by way of the gate of the runners to the sovereign’s house. And he sat
on the throne of the sovereigns. 
2Kings
11:20  And all the people of the land
rejoiced. And the city had rest, for they had slain Athalyahu with the sword in
the sovereign’s house. 
2Kings
11:21  Yeho’ash was seven years old when
he began to reign. 
2Kings
12:1  Yeho’ash began to reign in the
seventh year of Yĕhu, and he reigned forty years in Yerushalayim. And his
mother’s name was Tsiḇyah of Be’ĕrsheḇa. 
2Kings
12:2  And Yeho’ash did what was right in
the eyes of יהוה all the days in which Yehoyaḏa
the priest instructed him. 
2Kings
12:3  However, the high places were not taken
away; the people still slaughter and burned incense on the high places. 
2Kings
12:4  And Yeho’ash said to the priests, “All
the silver of the set-apart gifts that are brought into the House of יהוה,
the silver coming over, each man’s assessment silver, all the silver that a man
purposes in his heart to bring into the House of יהוה, 
2Kings
12:5  let the priests take for
themselves, each from his friend. And let them repair the damages of the House,
wherever there is damage.” 
2Kings
12:6  And it came to be, by the
twenty-third year of Sovereign Yeho’ash, that the priests had not repaired the
damages of the House, 
2Kings
12:7  and Sovereign Yeho’ash called
Yehoyaḏa the priest and the other priests, and said to them, “Why have
you not repaired the damages of the House? And now, do not take any more silver
from your friends, but give it for repairing the damages of the House.” 
2Kings
12:8  And the priests agreed that they
would neither receive any more silver from the people, nor repair the damages
of the House. 
2Kings
12:9  And Yehoyaḏa the priest took
a chest, and bored a hole in its lid, and set it beside the altar, on the right
side as one comes into the House of יהוה. And the
priests who guarded the door put there all the silver that was brought into the
House of יהוה. 
2Kings
12:10  And it came to be, whenever they
saw that there was much silver in the chest, that the sovereign’s scribe and
the high priest came up and put it in bags, and counted the silver that was
found in the House of יהוה, 
2Kings
12:11  and gave the silver, weighed out,
into the hands of those who did the work, who had the oversight of the House of
יהוה. And they paid it out to the carpenters and
builders who worked on the House of יהוה, 
2Kings
12:12  and to stonemasons and
stonecutters, and for buying timber and hewn stone to repair the damage of the
House of יהוה, and for all that was paid out to repair
the House. 
2Kings
12:13  However there were not made for
the House of יהוה basins of silver, snuffers,
sprinkling-bowls, trumpets, any objects of gold, or objects of silver, from the
silver that was brought into the House of יהוה, 
2Kings
12:14  for they gave that to the workmen,
and they repaired the House of יהוה with it. 
2Kings
12:15  And they did not reckon with the
men into whose hand they gave the silver to be paid to workmen, for they acted
trustworthily. 
2Kings
12:16  The silver from the trespass
offerings and the silver from the sin offerings was not brought into the House
of יהוה. It belonged to the priests.
2Kings
12:17  And Ḥaza’ĕl sovereign
of Aram went up and fought against Gath, and captured it. And Ḥaza’ĕl
set his face to go up to Yerushalayim. 
2Kings
12:18  And Yeho’ash sovereign of Yehuḏah
took all the set-apart gifts that his fathers, Yehoshaphat and Yehoram and
Aḥazyahu, sovereigns of Yehuḏah, had set apart, and his own
set-apart gifts, and all the gold found in the treasuries of the House of יהוה
and in the sovereign’s house, and sent them to Ḥaza’ĕl sovereign of
Aram. Then he went away from Yerushalayim. 
2Kings
12:19  And the rest of the acts of Yo’ash,
and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the
sovereigns of Yehuḏah? 
2Kings
12:20  And his servants rose up and made
a conspiracy, and smote Yo’ash in the house of Millo, which goes down to Silla.

2Kings
12:21  For Yozaḵar son of Shim‛ath
and Yehozaḇaḏ son of Shomĕr, his servants, smote him. So he
died, and they buried him with his fathers in the City of Dawiḏ. And
Amatsyah his son reigned in his place. 
2Kings
13:1  In the twenty-third year of Yo’ash
son of Aḥazyahu, sovereign of Yehuḏah, Yeho’aḥaz son of Yĕhu
began to reign over Yisra’ĕl in Shomeron, and reigned seventeen years. 
2Kings
13:2  And he did evil in the eyes of יהוה,
and followed the sins of Yaroḇ‛am son of Neḇat, who had made
Yisra’ĕl sin. He did not turn away from them. 
2Kings
13:3  And the displeasure of יהוה
burned against Yisra’ĕl, and He gave them into the hand of Ḥaza’ĕl
sovereign of Aram, and into the hand of Ben-Haḏaḏ son of Ḥaza’ĕl,
all the days.
2Kings
13:4  Then Yeho’aḥaz sought the
face of יהוה. And יהוה listened
to him, for He saw the oppression of Yisra’ĕl, because the sovereign of
Aram oppressed them. 
2Kings
13:5  And יהוה
gave Yisra’ĕl a saviour, so that they came out from under the hand of
Aram. And the children of Yisra’ĕl dwelt in their tents as before. 
2Kings
13:6  However, they did not turn away
from the sins of the house of Yaroḇ‛am, who had made Yisra’ĕl
sin, but walked in them. Moreover, the Ashĕrah also remained in Shomeron. 
2Kings
13:7  For He left of the army of Yeho’aḥaz
only fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen, for the
sovereign of Aram had destroyed them and made them like the dust at threshing. 
2Kings
13:8  And the rest of the acts of Yeho’aḥaz,
and all that he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the
annals of the sovereigns of Yisra’ĕl? 
2Kings
13:9  So Yeho’aḥaz slept with his
fathers, and they buried him in Shomeron. And Yo’ash his son reigned in his
place. 
2Kings
13:10  In the thirty-seventh year of Yo’ash
sovereign of Yehuḏah, Yeho’ash son of Yeho’aḥaz began to reign over
Yisra’ĕl in Shomeron, sixteen years. 
2Kings
13:11  And he did evil in the eyes of יהוה.
He did not turn away from all the sins of Yaroḇ‛am son of Neḇat,
who had made Yisra’ĕl sin – he walked in it. 
2Kings
13:12  And the rest of the acts of Yo’ash,
and all that he did, and his might with which he fought against Amatsyah
sovereign of Yehuḏah, are they not written in the book of the annals of
the sovereigns of Yisra’ĕl? 
2Kings
13:13  So Yo’ash slept with his fathers.
And Yaroḇ‛am sat on his throne. And Yo’ash was buried in Shomeron
with the sovereigns of Yisra’ĕl. 
2Kings
13:14  And Elisha had become sick with
the sickness in which he died. And Yo’ash the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl came
down to him, and wept over his face, and said, “O my father, my father, the
chariots of Yisra’ĕl and their horsemen!” 
2Kings
13:15  And Elisha said to him, “Take a
bow and some arrows.” And he took a bow and some arrows. 
2Kings
13:16  And he said to the sovereign of
Yisra’ĕl, “Place your hand on the bow.” So he placed his hand, and Elisha
placed his hands on the hands of the sovereign, 
2Kings
13:17  and said, “Open the east window.” And
he had opened it and Elisha said, “Shoot.” And he shot. Then he said, “The
arrow of deliverance of יהוה and the arrow of
deliverance from Aram, for you shall smite Aram at Aphĕq until it is
finished.” 
2Kings
13:18  Then he said, “Take the arrows,”
and he took them. And he said to the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl, “Strike the
ground,” and he struck three times, and stopped. 
2Kings
13:19  And the man of Elohim was wroth
with him and said, “You should have smitten five or six times, then you would
have smitten Aram till its utter destruction. But now you shall smite Aram only
three times.” 
2Kings
13:20  And Elisha died, and they buried
him. And the raiding bands from Mo’aḇ came into the land in the spring of
the year. 
2Kings
13:21  And it came to be, they were
burying a man, and there they saw a raiding band, and cast the man in the tomb
of Elisha. And the man fell and touched the bones of Elisha, and came to life
and stood on his feet. 
2Kings
13:22  And Ḥaza’ĕl sovereign
of Aram oppressed Yisra’ĕl all the days of Yeho’aḥaz. 
2Kings
13:23  But יהוה
showed favour to them, and had compassion on them, and turned toward them, for
the sake of His covenant with Aḇraham, Yitsḥaq, and Ya‛aqoḇ,
and would not destroy them or cast them from His presence as yet. 
2Kings
13:24  And Ḥaza’ĕl sovereign
of Aram died. And Ben-Haḏaḏ his son reigned in his place. 
2Kings
13:25  And Yeho’ash son of Yeho’aḥaz
recovered from the hand of Ben-Haḏaḏ, son of Ḥaza’ĕl,
the cities which he had taken out of the hand of Yeho’aḥaz his father in
battle. Yo’ash smote him three times, and he recovered the cities of Yisra’ĕl.
2Kings
14:1  In the second year of Yo’ash son of
Yo’aḥaz, sovereign of Yisra’ĕl, Amatsyahu son of Yo’ash, sovereign
of Yehuḏah, began to reign. 
2Kings
14:2  He was twenty-five years old when
he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Yerushalayim. And his
mother’s name was Yeho‛addin of Yerushalayim. 
2Kings
14:3  And he did what was right in the
eyes of יהוה, but not like his father Dawiḏ. He
did according to all his father Yo’ash did. 
2Kings
14:4  However, the high places were not
taken away. The people still slaughtered and burned incense on the high places.

2Kings
14:5  And it came to be, as soon as the
reign was strong in his hand, that he smote his servants who had smitten his
father the sovereign. 
2Kings
14:6  But he did not put to death the
children of the murderers, according to what is written in the Book of the
Torah of Mosheh, in which יהוה commanded, saying, “Fathers
are not put to death for the children, and children are not put to death for
the fathers, but each one is put to death for his own sin.” 
2Kings
14:7  He smote Eḏom in the Valley
of Salt, ten thousand, and took Sela in battle, and called its name Yoqthe’ĕl
to this day. 
2Kings
14:8  Amatsyah then sent messengers to
Yeho’ash son of Yeho’aḥaz, son of Yĕhu, sovereign of Yisra’ĕl,
saying, “Come, let us look each other in the face!” 
2Kings
14:9  And Yeho’ash sovereign of Yisra’ĕl
sent to Amatsyahu sovereign of Yehuḏah, saying, “The thistle that was in
Leḇanon sent to the cedar that was in Leḇanon, saying, ‘Give your
daughter to my son as wife.’ And a wild beast that was in Leḇanon passed
by and trampled the thistle. 
2Kings
14:10  “You have certainly smitten Eḏom,
and your heart has lifted you up. Be esteemed and stay in your house. But why
do you stir up yourself to evil, that you should fall – you and Yehuḏah
with you?”
2Kings
14:11  But Amatsyahu did not listen, so
Yeho’ash sovereign of Yisra’ĕl went up, and he and Amatsyahu sovereign of Yehuḏah
faced one another at Bĕyth Shemesh, which belongs to Yehuḏah. 
2Kings
14:12  And Yehuḏah was smitten
before Yisra’ĕl, and they each fled to his tent. 
2Kings
14:13  And Yeho’ash sovereign of Yisra’ĕl
caught Amatsyahu sovereign of Yehuḏah, son of Yeho’ash, son of
Aḥazyahu, at Bĕyth Shemesh. And they came to Yerushalayim and he
broke through the wall of Yerushalayim from the Gate of Ephrayim to the Corner
Gate, four hundred cubits, 
2Kings
14:14  and took all the gold and silver,
and all the objects that were found in the House of יהוה
and in the treasuries of the sovereign’s house, and hostages, and returned to
Shomeron. 
2Kings
14:15  And the rest of the acts of Yeho’ash
which he did, and his might, and how he fought with Amatsyahu sovereign of Yehuḏah,
are they not written in the book of the annals of the sovereigns of Yisra’ĕl?

2Kings
14:16  So Yeho’ash slept with his
fathers, and was buried in Shomeron with the sovereigns of Yisra’ĕl. And
Yaroḇ‛am his son reigned in his place. 
2Kings
14:17  And Amatsyahu son of Yo’ash,
sovereign of Yehuḏah, lived fifteen years after the death of Yeho’ash son
of Yeho’aḥaz, sovereign of Yisra’ĕl. 
2Kings
14:18  And the rest of the acts of
Amatsyahu, are they not written in the book of the annals of the sovereigns of
Yehuḏah? 
2Kings
14:19  And they made a conspiracy against
him in Yerushalayim, and he fled to Laḵish. And they sent after him to Laḵish
and killed him there, 
2Kings
14:20  and brought him on horses, and he
was buried at Yerushalayim with his fathers in the City of Dawiḏ. 
2Kings
14:21  And all the people of Yehuḏah
took Azaryah, who was sixteen years old, and set him up to reign instead of his
father Amatsyahu. 
2Kings
14:22  He built Ĕylath and restored
it to Yehuḏah, after the sovereign slept with his fathers. 
2Kings
14:23  In the fifteenth year of Amatsyahu
son of Yo’ash, the sovereign of Yehuḏah, Yaroḇ‛am son of Yo’ash,
the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl, began to reign in Shomeron, and reigned
forty-one years. 
2Kings
14:24  And he did evil in the eyes of יהוה.
He did not turn away from all the sins of Yaroḇ‛am son of Neḇat,
who had made Yisra’ĕl sin. 
2Kings
14:25  He restored the border of Yisra’ĕl
from the entrance of Ḥamath to the Sea of the Araḇah, according to
the word of יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, which He had
spoken through His servant Yonah son of Amittai, the prophet who was from Gath Ḥĕpher.

2Kings
14:26  For יהוה
saw that the affliction of Yisra’ĕl was very bitter. And there was no one,
neither shut up nor left at large, to help Yisra’ĕl. 
2Kings
14:27  And יהוה
had not said that He would blot out the name of Yisra’ĕl from under the
heavens, but saved them by the hand of Yaroḇ‛am son of Yo’ash. 
2Kings
14:28  And the rest of the acts of Yaroḇ‛am,
and all that he did, and his might, how he fought, and how he recovered
Dammeseq and Ḥamath for Yehuḏah in Yisra’ĕl, are they not
written in the book of the annals of the sovereigns of Yisra’ĕl? 
2Kings
14:29  So Yaroḇ‛am slept with
his fathers, the sovereigns of Yisra’ĕl. And Zeḵaryah his son reigned
in his place. 
2Kings
15:1  In the twenty-seventh year of Yaroḇ‛am
sovereign of Yisra’ĕl, Azaryah son of Amatsyah, sovereign of Yehuḏah,
began to reign. 
2Kings
15:2  He was sixteen years old when he
began to reign, and he reigned fifty-two years in Yerushalayim. And his mother’s
name was Yeḵolyahu of Yerushalayim. 
2Kings
15:3  And he did what was right in the
eyes of יהוה, according to all that his father
Amatsyahu did, 
2Kings
15:4  however, the high places were not
taken away. The people still slaughtered and burned incense on the high places.

2Kings
15:5  And יהוה
smote the sovereign, so that he was a leper until the day of his death, and he
dwelt in a separate house. And Yotham son of the sovereign was over the house,
ruling the people of the land. 
2Kings
15:6  And the rest of the acts of
Azaryahu, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the annals
of the sovereigns of Yehuḏah? 
2Kings
15:7  So Azaryah slept with his fathers,
and they buried him with his fathers in the City of Dawiḏ. And Yotham his
son reigned in his place. 
2Kings
15:8  In the thirty-eighth year of
Azaryahu sovereign of Yehuḏah, Zeḵaryahu son of Yaroḇ‛am
began to reign over Yisra’ĕl in Shomeron, for six months.
2Kings
15:9  And he did evil in the eyes of יהוה,
as his fathers had done. He did not turn away from the sins of Yaroḇ‛am
son of Neḇat, who had made Yisra’ĕl sin. 
2Kings
15:10  And Shallum son of Yaḇĕsh
conspired against him, and smote him in front of the people, and killed him,
and reigned in his place. 
2Kings
15:11  And the rest of the acts of Zeḵaryah,
see, they are written in the book of the annals of the sovereigns of Yisra’ĕl.

2Kings
15:12  This was the word of יהוה
which He spoke to Yĕhu, saying, “Your sons to the fourth generation are going to sit on the
throne of Yisra’ĕl.” And it came to be so. 
2Kings
15:13  Shallum son of Yaḇĕsh
began to reign in the thirty-ninth year of Uzziyah, the sovereign of Yehuḏah.
And he reigned a month of days in Shomeron. 
2Kings
15:14  And Menaḥĕm son of Gaḏi
went up from Tirtsah, and came to Shomeron, and smote Shallum son of Yaḇĕsh
in Shomeron and killed him, and reigned in his place. 
2Kings
15:15  And the rest of the acts of
Shallum, and the conspiracy which he led, see, they are written in the book of
the annals of the sovereigns of Yisra’ĕl. 
2Kings
15:16  And Menaḥĕm smote
Tiphsaḥ, and all who were there, and its borders, from Tirtsah. Because
they did not open it to him, therefore he smote it. And he ripped open all the
pregnant women. 
2Kings
15:17  In the thirty-ninth year of
Azaryah sovereign of Yehuḏah, Menaḥĕm son of Gaḏi began
to reign over Yisra’ĕl, ten years in Shomeron. 
2Kings
15:18  And he did evil in the eyes of יהוה.
He did not turn away from the sins of Yaroḇ‛am son of Neḇat,
who had made Yisra’ĕl sin, all his days. 
2Kings
15:19  Pul the sovereign of Ashshur came
against the land. And Menaḥĕm gave Pul a thousand talents of silver,
for his hand to be with him to strengthen the reign in his hand. 
2Kings
15:20  And Menaḥĕm exacted the
silver of Yisra’ĕl, of all the mighty men of wealth, of each man fifty
sheqels of silver, to give to the sovereign of Ashshur. And the sovereign of
Ashshur turned back, and did not stay there in the land. 
2Kings
15:21  And the rest of the acts of
Menaḥĕm, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of
the annals of the sovereigns of Yisra’ĕl? 
2Kings
15:22  So Menaḥĕm slept with
his fathers. And Peqaḥyah his son reigned in his place. 
2Kings
15:23  In the fiftieth year of Azaryah
the sovereign of Yehuḏah, Peqaḥyah the son of Menaḥĕm
began to reign over Yisra’ĕl in Shomeron, for two years. 
2Kings
15:24  And he did evil in the eyes of יהוה.
He did not turn away from the sins of Yaroḇ‛am son of Neḇat,
who had made Yisra’ĕl sin.
2Kings
15:25  And Peqaḥ son of Remalyahu,
a chief officer of his, conspired against him and smote him in Shomeron, in the
high place of the sovereign’s house, along with Argoḇ and Aryĕh, and
with him were fifty men of Gil‛aḏ. So he killed him and reigned in
his place. 
2Kings
15:26  And the rest of the acts of
Peqaḥyah, and all that he did, see, they are written in the book of the
annals of the sovereigns of Yisra’ĕl. 
2Kings
15:27  In the fifty-second year of
Azaryah sovereign of Yehuḏah, Peqaḥ son of Remalyahu began to reign
over Yisra’ĕl in Shomeron, for twenty years. 
2Kings
15:28  And he did evil in the eyes of יהוה.
He did not turn away from the sins of Yaroḇ‛am son of Neḇat,
who had made Yisra’ĕl sin. 
2Kings
15:29  In the days of Peqaḥ
sovereign of Yisra’ĕl, Tiḡlath-Pileser sovereign of Ashshur came and
took Iyon, and Aḇĕl Bĕyth Ma‛aḵah, and
Yanowaḥ, and Qeḏesh, and Ḥatsor, and Gil‛aḏ, and
Galil, all the land of Naphtali, and took them into exile to Ashshur. 
2Kings
15:30  And Hoshĕa son of Ĕlah
led a conspiracy against Peqaḥ son of Remalyahu, and smote him, and
killed him, and reigned in his place in the twentieth year of Yotham son of
Uzziyah. 
2Kings
15:31  And the rest of the acts of
Peqaḥ, and all that he did, see, they are written in the book of the
annals of the sovereigns of Yisra’ĕl. 
2Kings
15:32  In the second year of Peqaḥ
son of Remalyahu, sovereign of Yisra’ĕl, Yotham son of Uzziyahu, sovereign
of Yehuḏah, began to reign. 
2Kings
15:33  He was twenty-five years old when
he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Yerushalayim. And his mother’s
name was Yerusha the daughter of Tsaḏoq. 
2Kings
15:34  And he did what was right in the
eyes of יהוה. He did according to all that his father
Uzziyahu did. 
2Kings
15:35  However, the high places were not
taken away. The people still slaughtered and burned incense on the high places.
He built the Upper Gate of the House of יהוה. 
2Kings
15:36  And the rest of the acts of
Yotham, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of
the sovereigns of Yehuḏah? 
2Kings
15:37  In those days יהוה
began to send Retsin sovereign of Aram and Peqaḥ son of Remalyahu against
Yehuḏah. 
2Kings
15:38  So Yotham slept with his fathers,
and was buried with his fathers in the City of Dawiḏ his father. And
Aḥaz his son reigned in his place. 
2Kings
16:1  In the seventeenth year of
Peqaḥ son of Remalyahu, Aḥaz son of Yotham, sovereign of Yehuḏah,
began to reign.
2Kings
16:2  Aḥaz was twenty years old
when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Yerushalayim. And he
did not do what was right in the eyes of יהוה his
Elohim, as his father Dawiḏ had done. 
2Kings
16:3  But he walked in the way of the
sovereigns of Yisra’ĕl, and he also made his son pass through the fire,
according to the abominations of the gentiles whom יהוה
had dispossessed from before the children of Yisra’ĕl. 
2Kings
16:4  And he slaughtered and burned
incense on the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree. 
2Kings
16:5  Then Retsin sovereign of Aram and
Peqaḥ son of Remalyahu, sovereign of Yisra’ĕl, came up to
Yerushalayim, to battle. And they besieged Aḥaz but were unable to
overcome him. 
2Kings
16:6  At that time Retsin sovereign of
Aram recovered Ĕylath for Aram, and drove the men of Yehuḏah from Ĕylath.
And the Eḏomites went to Ĕylath, and have dwelt there to this day. 
2Kings
16:7  And Aḥaz sent messengers to
Tiḡlath-Pileser sovereign of Ashshur, saying, “I am your servant and your
son. Come up and save me from the hand of the sovereign of Aram and from the
hand of the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl, who are rising up against me.”
2Kings
16:8  And Aḥaz took the silver and
gold that was found in the House of יהוה, and in the
treasuries of the house of the sovereign, and sent it as a present to the
sovereign of Ashshur. 
2Kings
16:9  And the sovereign of Ashshur
listened to him. And the sovereign of Ashshur went up against Dammeseq and
captured it, and exiled it to Qir, and he killed Retsin. 
2Kings
16:10  And Sovereign Aḥaz went to
meet Tiḡlath-Pileser sovereign of Ashshur at Dummeseq, and saw an altar
that was at Dammaseq. And Sovereign Aḥaz sent to Uriyah the priest a
sketch of the altar and its pattern, according to all its workmanship. 
2Kings
16:11  And Uriyah the priest built an
altar according to all that Sovereign Aḥaz had sent from Dammeseq. And
Uriyah the priest made it before Sovereign Aḥaz came from Dammeseq. 
2Kings
16:12  And when the sovereign came from
Dammeseq, the sovereign saw the altar, and the sovereign approached the altar
and made offerings on it. 
2Kings
16:13  And he burned his burnt offering
and his grain offering. And he poured his drink offering and sprinkled the
blood of his peace offerings on the altar. 
2Kings
16:14  And the bronze altar which was
before יהוה he brought from the front of the House,
from between the new altar and the House of יהוה, and
put it on the north side of his
altar. 
2Kings
16:15  And Sovereign Aḥaz commanded
Uriyah the priest, saying, “On the great altar burn the morning burnt offering,
and the evening grain offering, and the sovereign’s burnt offering, and his
grain offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the land, and
their grain offering, and their drink offerings. And sprinkle on it all the
blood of the burnt offering and all the blood of the slaughtering. And the
bronze altar is for me to inquire by.”
2Kings
16:16  And Uriyah the priest did
according to all that Sovereign Aḥaz commanded. 
2Kings
16:17  And Sovereign Aḥaz cut off the
side panels of the stands, and removed the basins from them. And he took down
the Sea from the bronze oxen that were under it, and put it on a pavement of
stones. 
2Kings
16:18  And the covered way which they had
built in the House for the Sabbath, and the sovereign’s outer entrance, he took
from the House of יהוה, because of the sovereign of
Ashshur. 
2Kings
16:19  And the rest of the acts of
Aḥaz which he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the
sovereigns of Yehuḏah? 
2Kings
16:20  So Aḥaz slept with his
fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the City of Dawiḏ. And Ḥizqiyahu
his son reigned in his place. 
2Kings
17:1  In the twelfth year of Aḥaz
sovereign of Yehuḏah, Hoshĕa son of Ĕlah began to reign over
Yisra’ĕl in Shomeron, for nine years. 
2Kings
17:2  And he did evil in the eyes of יהוה,
but not as the sovereigns of Yisra’ĕl who were before him. 
2Kings
17:3  Shalmaneser sovereign of Ashshur
came up against him. And Hoshĕa became his servant, and rendered him a
present. 
2Kings
17:4  But the sovereign of Ashshur found
a conspiracy in Hoshĕa, for he had sent messengers to So, sovereign of
Mitsrayim, and had not brought a present to the sovereign of Ashshur, as year
by year. And the sovereign of Ashshur shut him up, and bound him in prison. 
2Kings
17:5  And the sovereign of Ashshur went
through all the land, and went up to Shomeron and besieged it for three years. 
2Kings
17:6  In the ninth year of Hoshĕa,
the sovereign of Ashshur captured Shomeron and exiled Yisra’ĕl to Ashshur,
and settled them in Ḥalaḥ and Ḥaḇor, the River of
Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes. 
2Kings
17:7  Now this came to be because the
children of Yisra’ĕl had sinned against יהוה their
Elohim – who had brought them up out of the land of Mitsrayim, from under the
hand of Pharaoh sovereign of Mitsrayim – and feared other mighty ones, 
2Kings
17:8  and walked in the laws of the
gentiles whom יהוה had dispossessed from before the
children of Yisra’ĕl, and of the sovereigns of Yisra’ĕl that they had
made. 
2Kings
17:9  And the children of Yisra’ĕl
secretly did against יהוה their Elohim matters that
were not right, and they built for themselves high places in all their cities,
from watchtower unto the walled city, 
2Kings
17:10  and set up for themselves pillars
and Ashĕrim on every high hill and under every green tree, 
2Kings
17:11  and burned incense there on all
the high places, like the gentiles whom יהוה had
removed from their presence. And they did evil matters to provoke יהוה,

2Kings
17:12  and served the idols, of which יהוה
had said to them, “Do not do this.” 
2Kings
17:13  And יהוה
warned Yisra’ĕl and Yehuḏah, through all of His prophets, and every
seer, saying, “Turn back from your evil ways, and guard My commands and My
laws, according to all the Torah which I commanded your fathers, and which I
sent to you by My servants the prophets.” 
2Kings
17:14  But they did not listen and
hardened their necks, like the necks of their fathers, who did not put their
trust in יהוה their Elohim, 
2Kings
17:15  and rejected His laws and His
covenant that He had made with their fathers, and His witnesses which He had
witnessed against them, and went after worthlessness, and became worthless, and
after the gentiles who were all around them, of whom יהוה
had commanded them not to do like them. 
2Kings
17:16  And they left all the commands of יהוה
their Elohim, and made for themselves a moulded image, two calves, and made an
Ashĕrah and bowed themselves to all the host of the heavens, and served Ba‛al,

2Kings
17:17  and caused their sons and
daughters to pass through the fire, and practised divination and sorcery, and
sold themselves to do evil in the eyes of יהוה, to
provoke Him. 
2Kings
17:18  So יהוה
was very enraged with Yisra’ĕl, and removed them from His presence – none
was left but the tribe of Yehuḏah alone. 
2Kings
17:19  Yehuḏah, also, did not guard
the commands of יהוה their Elohim, but walked in the
laws of Yisra’ĕl which they made.
2Kings
17:20  And יהוה
rejected all the seed of Yisra’ĕl, and afflicted them, and gave them into
the hand of plunderers, until He had cast them out from His presence. 
2Kings
17:21  For He tore Yisra’ĕl from the
house of Dawiḏ, and they made Yaroḇ‛am son of Neḇat
sovereign. And Yaroḇ‛am drove Yisra’ĕl from following יהוה,
and made them commit a great sin. 
2Kings
17:22  And the children of Yisra’ĕl
walked in all the sins of Yaroḇ‛am which he did. They did not turn
away from them, 
2Kings
17:23  until יהוה
removed Yisra’ĕl from His presence, as He spoke by all His servants the
prophets. So Yisra’ĕl was exiled from their land to Ashshur, as it is to
this day. 
2Kings
17:24  And the sovereign of Ashshur
brought people from Baḇel, and
from Kuthah, and from Awwa, and from Ḥamath, and Sepharwayim, and placed them in the cities of Shomeron instead
of the children of Yisra’ĕl. And they took possession of Shomeron and
dwelt in its cities. 
2Kings
17:25  And it came to be, at the
beginning of their dwelling there, that they did not fear יהוה,
and יהוה sent lions among them, which kept on slaying
among them. 
2Kings
17:26  And they spoke to the sovereign of
Ashshur, saying, “The nations whom you have removed and placed in the cities of
Shomeron do not know the right-ruling of the Elohim of the land. And He has
sent lions among them, and see, they are slaying among them because they do not
know the right-ruling of the Elohim of the land.” 
2Kings
17:27  And the sovereign of Ashshur
commanded, saying, “Send one of the priests whom you exiled from there, to go
there. Let him go and dwell there, and let him teach them the right-ruling of
the Elohim of the land.” 
2Kings
17:28  And one of the priests whom they
had exiled from Shomeron came and dwelt in Bĕyth Ĕl, and taught them
how to fear יהוה.
2Kings
17:29  But every nation was making mighty
ones of its own, and put them in the houses of the high places which the
Shomeronites had made, every nation in the cities where they dwelt. 
2Kings
17:30  And the men of Baḇel made
Sukkoth Benoth, and the men of Kuth made Nĕrḡal, and the men of Ḥamath
made Ashima, 
2Kings
17:31  and the Awwites made Niḇḥaz
and Tartaq. And the Sepharwites burned their children in fire to Aḏrammeleḵ
and Anammeleḵ, the mighty ones of Sepharim. 
2Kings
17:32  They also feared יהוה,
and from every class they made for themselves priests of the high places, who
offered for them in the house of the high places. 
2Kings
17:33  They were fearing יהוה,
and they were serving their own mighty ones, according to the ruling of the
nations from among whom they had been exiled.
2Kings
17:34  To this day they are doing
according to the former rulings: they are not fearing יהוה,
nor do they follow their laws or their right-rulings, or the Torah and command
which יהוה had commanded the children of Ya‛aqoḇ,
whose name He made Yisra’ĕl, 
2Kings
17:35  with whom יהוה
had made a covenant and commanded them, saying, “Do not fear other mighty ones,
nor bow down to them nor serve them nor slaughter to them; 
2Kings
17:36  but יהוה,
who brought you up from the land of Mitsrayim with great power and with an
outstretched arm, Him you shall fear, and to Him you shall bow yourselves, and
to Him you shall slaughter. 
2Kings
17:37  “And guard to do forever the laws,
and the right-rulings, and the Torah, and the command which He wrote for you.
And do not fear other mighty ones. 
2Kings
17:38  “And do not forget the covenant
that I have made with you, and do not fear other mighty ones. 
2Kings
17:39  “But fear יהוה
your Elohim, so that He delivers you from the hand of all your enemies.”
2Kings
17:40  And they did not obey, but did
according to their former ruling. 
2Kings
17:41  So these nations were fearing יהוה,
and served their carved images, both their children and their children’s
children. As their fathers did, they are doing to this day.
2Kings
18:1  And it came to be in the third year
of Hoshĕa son of Ĕlah, sovereign of Yisra’ĕl, that Ḥizqiyah
son of Aḥaz, sovereign of Yehuḏah, began to reign.
2Kings
18:2  He was twenty-five years old when
he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Yerushalayim. And his
mother’s name was Aḇi, daughter of Zeḵaryah. 
2Kings
18:3  And he did what was right in the
eyes of יהוה, according to all that his father Dawiḏ
did. 
2Kings
18:4  He took away the high places and
broke the pillars, and cut down the Ashĕrah, and broke in pieces the
bronze serpent which Mosheh had made, for until those days the children of
Yisra’ĕl burned incense to it, and called it Neḥushtan. 
2Kings
18:5  He put his trust in יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, and after him was none like him among all the
sovereigns of Yehuḏah, nor who were before him, 
2Kings
18:6  and he clung to יהוה.
He did not turn away from following Him, but guarded His commands, which יהוה
had commanded Mosheh. 
2Kings
18:7  And יהוה
was with him – wherever he went he acted wisely. And he rebelled against the
sovereign of Ashshur and did not serve him. 
2Kings
18:8  He smote the Philistines, as far as
Azzah and its borders – from watchtower unto the walled city. 
2Kings
18:9  And it came to be in the fourth
year of Sovereign Ḥizqiyahu, which was the seventh year of Hoshĕa
son of Ĕlah, sovereign of Yisra’ĕl, that Shalmaneser sovereign of
Ashshur came up against Shomeron and besieged it, 
2Kings
18:10  and they captured it at the end of
three years. In the sixth year of Ḥizqiyah, that is the ninth year of
Hoshĕa sovereign of Yisra’ĕl, Shomeron was captured. 
2Kings
18:11  And the sovereign of Ashshur
exiled Yisra’ĕl to Ashshur, and placed them in Ḥalaḥ and Ḥaḇor,
the River of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes, 
2Kings
18:12  because they did not obey the
voice of יהוה their Elohim, but transgressed His
covenant – all that Mosheh the servant of יהוה had
commanded. And they did not obey nor do them. 
2Kings
18:13  And in the fourteenth year of
Sovereign Ḥizqiyahu, Sanḥĕriḇ sovereign of Ashshur came
up against all the walled cities of Yehuḏah and captured them. 
2Kings
18:14  And Ḥizqiyah sovereign of
Yehuḏah sent to the sovereign of Ashshur at Laḵish, saying, “I have
done wrong, turn away from me. I shall bear whatever you impose on me.” And the
sovereign of Ashshur imposed upon Ḥizqiyah, the sovereign of Yehuḏah,
three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold. 
2Kings
18:15  And Ḥizqiyah gave him all
the silver that was found in the House of יהוה and in
the treasuries of the sovereign’s house. 
2Kings
18:16  At that time Ḥizqiyah cut
off the doors of the Hĕḵal of יהוה, and the
doorposts which Ḥizqiyah sovereign of Yehuḏah had overlaid, and
gave it to the sovereign of Ashshur. 
2Kings
18:17  And the sovereign of Ashshur sent
the Tartan, and the Raḇsaris, and the Raḇshaqĕh from Laḵish,
with a great army against Yerushalayim, to Sovereign Ḥizqiyahu. And they
went up and came to Yerushalayim. And when they had come up, they came and
stood by the channel of the upper pool, which was on the highway to the
Launderer’s Field. 
2Kings
18:18  And they called to the sovereign.
And Elyaqim son of Ḥilqiyahu, who was over the household, and Sheḇnah
the scribe, and Yo’aḥ son of Asaph, the recorder, came out to them. 
2Kings
18:19  And the Raḇshaqĕh said
to them, “Please say to Ḥizqiyahu, ‘Thus said the great sovereign, the
sovereign of Ashshur, “What is this trust in which you have trusted? 
2Kings
18:20  “You have spoken of having counsel
and strength for battle, but they are only words of the lips! And in whom do
you trust, that you rebel against me? 
2Kings
18:21  “Now look! You have put your trust
in the staff of this crushed reed, Mitsrayim, on which if a man leans, it shall
go into his hand and pierce it. So is Pharaoh sovereign of Mitsrayim to all who
trust in him. 
2Kings
18:22  “But when you say to me, ‘We trust
in יהוה our Elohim,’ is it not He whose high places and
whose altars Ḥizqiyahu has taken away, and said to Yehuḏah and Yerushalayim,
‘Bow yourselves before this altar in Yerushalayim’?” ’ 
2Kings
18:23  “And now, I urge you, give a
pledge to my master the sovereign of Ashshur, then I give you two thousand
horses, if you are able to put riders on them!
2Kings
18:24  “And how do you turn back the face
of one commander of the least of my master’s servants, and trust in Mitsrayim
for chariots and horsemen? 
2Kings
18:25  “Have I now come up without יהוה
against this place to destroy it? יהוה said to me, ‘Go
up against this land, and you shall destroy it.’ ” 
2Kings
18:26  Then said Elyaqim son of Ḥilqiyahu,
and Sheḇnah, and Yo’aḥ to the Raḇshaqĕh, “Please speak
to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it. And do not speak to us in
the language of Yehuḏah, in the ears of the people on the wall.” 
2Kings
18:27  And the Raḇshaqĕh said
to them, “Has my master sent me to your master and to you to speak these words,
and not to the men sitting on the wall to eat their own dung and drink their
own urine, with you?” 
2Kings
18:28  And the Raḇshaqĕh stood
and called out with a loud voice in the language of Yehuḏah, and spoke
and said, “Hear the word of the great sovereign, the sovereign of Ashshur! 
2Kings
18:29  “Thus said the sovereign, ‘Do not
let Ḥizqiyahu deceive you, for he is unable to deliver you out of his
hand, 
2Kings
18:30  and do not let Ḥizqiyahu
make you trust in יהוה, saying, “ יהוה
shall certainly deliver us, and this city is not given into the hand of the
sovereign of Ashshur.” ’ 
2Kings
18:31  “Do not listen to Ḥizqiyahu,
for thus said the sovereign of Ashshur, ‘Make peace with me by a present and
come out to me, and let each of you eat from his own vine and each from his own
fig tree, and each of you drink the waters of his own cistern, 
2Kings
18:32  until I come. Then I shall take
you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of
bread and vineyards, a land of olive-trees and honey, and live, and not die.
But do not listen to Ḥizqiyahu, when he misleads you, saying, “ יהוה
shall deliver us.” 
2Kings
18:33  ‘Has any of the mighty ones of the
nations at all delivered its land from the hand of the sovereign of Ashshur? 
2Kings
18:34  ‘Where are the mighty ones of Ḥamath
and Arpaḏ? Where are the mighty ones of Sepharwayim and Hĕna and
Iwwah? Did they deliver Shomeron from my hand? 
2Kings
18:35  ‘Who among all the mighty ones of
the lands have delivered their land out of my hand, that יהוה
should deliver Yerushalayim from my hand?’ ”
2Kings
18:36  But the people were silent and did
not answer him a word, for the command of the sovereign was, “Do not answer
him.” 
2Kings
18:37  And Elyaqim son of Ḥilqiyah,
who was over the household, and Sheḇnah the scribe, and Yo’aḥ son
of Asaph, the recorder, came to Ḥizqiyahu with their garments torn, and
they reported to him the words of the Raḇshaqĕh. 
2Kings
19:1  And it came to be, when Sovereign Ḥizqiyahu
heard it, that he tore his garments, and covered himself with sackcloth, and
went into the House of יהוה, 
2Kings
19:2  and sent Elyaqim, who was over the
household, and Sheḇnah the scribe, and the elders of the priests,
covering themselves with sackcloth, to Yeshayahu the prophet, son of Amots. 
2Kings
19:3  And they said to him, “Thus said Ḥizqiyahu,
‘This day is a day of distress and rebuke and scorn, for the children have come
to birth but there is no power to bring forth. 
2Kings
19:4  ‘It could be that יהוה
your Elohim does hear all the words of the Raḇshaqĕh, whom his
master the sovereign of Ashshur has sent to reproach the living Elohim, and
shall rebuke the words which יהוה your Elohim has
heard. Therefore lift up your prayer for the remnant that is left.’ ” 
2Kings
19:5  And the servants of Sovereign Ḥizqiyahu
came to Yeshayahu, 
2Kings
19:6  and Yeshayahu said to them, “Say
this to your master, ‘Thus said יהוה, “Do not be afraid
of the words which you have heard, with which the servants of the sovereign of
Ashshur have reviled Me.
2Kings
19:7  “See, I am putting a spirit upon
him, and he shall hear a report and return to his own land. And I shall cause
him to fall by the sword in his land.” ’ ” 
2Kings
19:8  And the Raḇshaqĕh
returned and found the sovereign of Ashshur fighting against Liḇnah, for
he had heard that he had left Laḵish. 
2Kings
19:9  And when the sovereign heard
concerning Tirhaqah sovereign of Kush, “See, he has come out to fight against
you,” he again sent messengers to Ḥizqiyahu, saying,
2Kings
19:10  “Speak to Ḥizqiyahu
sovereign of Yehuḏah, saying, ‘Do not let your Elohim in whom you trust
deceive you, saying, “Yerushalayim is not given into the hand of the sovereign
of Ashshur.” 
2Kings
19:11  ‘See, you have heard what the
sovereigns of Ashshur have done to all lands by putting them under the ban. And
are you going to be delivered? 
2Kings
19:12  ‘Have the mighty ones of the
nations delivered those whom my fathers have destroyed: Gozan and Ḥaran
and Retseph, and the sons of Ĕḏen who were in Telassar? 
2Kings
19:13  ‘Where is the sovereign of Ḥamath,
and the sovereign of Arpaḏ, and the sovereign of the city of Sepharwayim,
Hĕna, and Iwwah?’ ” 
2Kings
19:14  And Ḥizqiyahu received the
letters from the hand of the messengers, and read them, and went up to the
House of יהוה. And Ḥizqiyahu spread it before יהוה.

2Kings
19:15  And Ḥizqiyahu prayed before יהוה,
and said, “O יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, the One who
dwells between the keruḇim, You are Elohim, You alone, of all the reigns
of the earth. You have made the heavens and earth. 
2Kings
19:16  “Incline Your ear, O יהוה,
and hear. Open Your eyes, O יהוה, and see. And hear the
words of Sanḥĕriḇ, which he has sent to reproach the living
Elohim. 
2Kings
19:17  “Truly, יהוה,
the sovereigns of Ashshur have laid waste the nations and their lands, 
2Kings
19:18  and have put their mighty ones
into the fire, for they were not mighty ones, but the work of men’s hands, wood
and stone, and destroyed them. 
2Kings
19:19  “And now, O יהוה
our Elohim, I pray, save us from his hand, so that all the reigns of the earth
know that You are יהוה Elohim, You alone.” 
2Kings
19:20  Then Yeshayahu son of Amots sent
to Ḥizqiyahu, saying, “Thus said יהוה Elohim of
Yisra’ĕl, ‘I have heard that which you have prayed to Me against
Sanḥĕriḇ sovereign of Ashshur.’ 
2Kings
19:21  “This is the word which יהוה
has spoken concerning him, ‘The maiden, the daughter of Tsiyon, has despised
you, mocked you; the daughter of Yerushalayim has shaken her head behind you! 
2Kings
19:22  ‘Whom have you reproached and
reviled? Against whom have you raised a voice, and lifted up your eyes on high?
Against the Set-apart One of Yisra’ĕl! 
2Kings
19:23  ‘By the hand of your messengers
you have reproached יהוה, and said, “With my many
chariots I have come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Leḇanon.
And I cut down its tall cedars, its choice cypress trees. And I enter its
remotest parts, its thickest forest. 
2Kings
19:24  ‘I have dug and drunk strange
water, and with the soles of my feet I dry up all the streams of defence.” 
2Kings
19:25  ‘Have you not heard long ago, I
made it; from days of old I formed it? Now I have brought it to be, that you
should make walled cities ruinous heaps. 
2Kings
19:26  ‘And their inhabitants were
powerless, they were overthrown and put to shame, they were as the grass of the
field and the green plants, as the grass on the house-tops and withered before
it came up. 
2Kings
19:27  ‘But I know your sitting down, and
your going out and your coming in, and your rage against Me. 
2Kings
19:28  ‘Because your rage against Me and
your pride have come up to My ears, I shall put My hook in your nose and My
bridle in your lips, and I shall turn you back by the way which you came. 
2Kings
19:29  ‘And this is the sign for you:
This year you eat what grows of itself, and in the second year what springs
from that, and in the third year sow and reap and plant vineyards and eat their
fruit. 
2Kings
19:30  ‘And the remnant who have escaped
of the house of Yehuḏah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit
upward. 
2Kings
19:31  ‘For out of Yerushalayim comes
forth a remnant, and those who escape from Mount Tsiyon – the ardour of יהוה
does this.’ 
2Kings
19:32  “Therefore thus said יהוה
concerning the sovereign of Ashshur, ‘He does not come into this city, nor does
he shoot an arrow there, nor does he come before it with shield, nor does he
build a siege mound against it. 
2Kings
19:33  ‘By the way that he came, by the
same he turns back. And he does not come into this city,’ declares יהוה.

2Kings
19:34  ‘And I shall defend this city, to
save it for My own sake and for the sake of Dawiḏ My servant.’ ” 
2Kings
19:35  And it came to be in that night
that the messenger of יהוה went out, and smote in the
camp of Ashshur one hundred and eighty-five thousand. And they rose up early in
the morning and saw all of them dead bodies. 
2Kings
19:36  And Sanḥĕriḇ
sovereign of Ashshur broke camp and went away, and turned back, and remained in
Ninewĕh. 
2Kings
19:37  And it came to be, as he was
bowing himself in the house of Nisroḵ his mighty one, that his sons Aḏrammeleḵ
and Shar’etser smote him with the sword, and they escaped into the land of
Ararat. And his son Ĕsarḥaddon reigned in his place. 
2Kings
20:1  In those days Ḥizqiyahu was
sick unto death. And Yeshayahu the prophet, son of Amots, went to him and said
to him, “Thus said יהוה, ‘Set your house in order, for
you are going to die, and not live.’ ” 
2Kings
20:2  And he turned his face toward the
wall, and prayed to יהוה, saying, 
2Kings
20:3  “I pray to You, O יהוה,
remember how I have walked before You in truth and with a perfect heart, and
have done what was good in Your eyes.” And Ḥizqiyahu wept bitterly. 
2Kings
20:4  And it came to be, before Yeshayahu
had gone out into the middle court, that the word of יהוה
came to him, saying, 
2Kings
20:5  “Return and say to Ḥizqiyahu
the leader of My people, ‘Thus said יהוה, the Elohim of
Dawiḏ your father, “I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears.
See, I am going to heal you. On the third day go up to the House of יהוה.

2Kings
20:6  “And I shall add to your days
fifteen years, and deliver you and this city from the hand of the sovereign of
Ashshur, and shall defend this city for My own sake, and for the sake of Dawiḏ
My servant.” ’ ” 
2Kings
20:7  And Yeshayahu said, “Take a cake of
figs.” And they took and laid it on the boil, and he recovered. 
2Kings
20:8  And Ḥizqiyahu said to
Yeshayahu, “What is the sign that יהוה does heal me,
and that I shall go up to the House of יהוה the third
day?” 
2Kings
20:9  And Yeshayahu said, “This is the
sign for you from יהוה, that יהוה
does the word which He has spoken: shall the shadow go forward ten degrees or
go backward ten degrees?” 
2Kings
20:10  And Ḥizqiyahu said, “It
would be easy for the shadow to go down ten degrees; no, but let the shadow go
backward ten degrees.” 
2Kings
20:11  And Yeshayahu the prophet cried
out to יהוה, and He brought the shadow ten degrees
backward, by which it had gone down on the sundial of Aḥaz. 
2Kings
20:12  At that time Beroḏaḵ-Balaḏan
son of Balaḏan, sovereign of Baḇel, sent letters and a present to Ḥizqiyahu,
for he heard that Ḥizqiyahu had been sick. 
2Kings
20:13  And Ḥizqiyahu listened to
them, and showed them all his treasure house, the silver and the gold, and the
spices and the precious ointment, and all his armoury, and all that was found
among his treasures. There was not an object in his house or in all his rule
that Ḥizqiyahu did not show them.
2Kings
20:14  And Yeshayahu the prophet came to
Sovereign Ḥizqiyahu, and said to him, “What did these men say, and from
where did they come to you?” And Ḥizqiyahu said, “They came from a
distant land, from Baḇel.” 
2Kings
20:15  And he said, “What have they seen
in your house?” And Ḥizqiyahu answered, “They saw all that is in my
house; there is not an object among my treasures that I did not show them.” 
2Kings
20:16  And Yeshayahu said to Ḥizqiyahu,
“Hear the word of יהוה : 
2Kings
20:17  ‘See, the days are coming when all
that is in your house, and what your fathers have treasured up until this day,
shall be brought to Baḇel – no object is to be left,’ said יהוה.

2Kings
20:18  ‘And they are going to take away
some of your sons who are to be born to you, whom you bring forth, and they
shall be eunuchs in the palace of the sovereign of Baḇel.’ ” 
2Kings
20:19  And Ḥizqiyahu said to
Yeshayahu, “The word of יהוה which you have spoken is
good!” And he said, “Is it not so, if peace and truth are to be in my days?” 
2Kings
20:20  And the rest of the acts of Ḥizqiyahu,
and all his might and how he made a pool and a channel and brought water into
the city, are they not written in the book of the annals of the sovereigns of
Yehuḏah? 
2Kings
20:21  So Ḥizqiyahu slept with his
fathers. And Menashsheh his son reigned in his place. 
2Kings
21:1  Menashsheh was twelve years old
when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty-five years in Yerushalayim. And
his mother’s name was Ḥephtsiḇah. 
2Kings
21:2  And he did evil in the eyes of יהוה,
according to the abominations of the gentiles whom יהוה
dispossessed before the children of Yisra’ĕl. 
2Kings
21:3  For he turned and built the high
places which Ḥizqiyahu his father had destroyed, and raised up altars for
Ba‛al, and made an Ashĕrah, as Aḥaḇ sovereign of Yisra’ĕl
had done, and he bowed himself to all the host of the heavens and served them. 
2Kings
21:4  And he built altars in the House of
יהוה, of which יהוה had said, “In
Yerushalayim I put My Name.” 
2Kings
21:5  And he built altars for all the
host of the heavens in the two courtyards of the House of יהוה.

2Kings
21:6  And he made his son pass through
the fire, and practised magic, and used divination, and consulted spiritists
and mediums. He did much evil in the eyes of יהוה, to
provoke Him.
2Kings
21:7  And he placed a carved image of Ashĕrah
that he had made in the House of which יהוה had said to
Dawiḏ and to Shelomoh his son, “In this house and in Yerushalayim, which
I have chosen out of all the tribes of Yisra’ĕl, I put My Name forever, 
2Kings
21:8  and no more shall I cause the feet
of Yisra’ĕl to move from the soil which I gave their fathers – only if
they guard to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to
all the Torah that My servant Mosheh commanded them.” 
2Kings
21:9  But they did not obey, and
Menashsheh led them astray to do more evil than the gentiles whom יהוה
had destroyed before the children of Yisra’ĕl. 
2Kings
21:10  And יהוה
spoke by His servants the prophets, saying, 
2Kings
21:11  “Because Menashsheh sovereign of
Yehuḏah has done these abominations, having done more evil than all the
Amorites who were before him, and also made Yehuḏah sin with his idols, 
2Kings
21:12  therefore thus said יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, ‘See, I am bringing such evil upon Yerushalayim and
Yehuḏah that both ears of those who hear of it shall tingle. 
2Kings
21:13  ‘And I shall stretch over
Yerushalayim the measuring line of Shomeron and the plummet of the house of
Aḥaḇ, and shall wipe Yerushalayim as one wipes a dish, wiping it
and turning it upside down. 
2Kings
21:14  ‘And I shall forsake the remnant
of My inheritance and give them into the hand of their enemies. And they shall
be for a prey and for a plunder to all their enemies, 
2Kings
21:15  because they have done evil in My
eyes, and have provoked Me since the day their fathers came out of Mitsrayim,
even to this day.’ ” 
2Kings
21:16  And also, Menashsheh shed very
much innocent blood, until he had filled Yerushalayim from one end to another,
besides his sin with which he made Yehuḏah sin, in doing evil in the eyes
of יהוה.
2Kings
21:17  And the rest of the acts of
Menashsheh, and all that he did, and the sin that he committed, are they not
written in the book of the annals of the sovereigns of Yehuḏah? 
2Kings
21:18  So Menashsheh slept with his
fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza.
And his son Amon reigned in his place. 
2Kings
21:19  Amon was twenty-two years old when
he began to reign, and he reigned two years in Yerushalayim. And the name of
his mother was Meshullemeth the daughter of Ḥaruts of Yoteḇah. 
2Kings
21:20  And he did evil in the eyes of יהוה,
as his father Menashsheh had done, 
2Kings
21:21  and walked in all the ways that
his father had walked, and served the idols that his father had served, and
bowed himself to them, 
2Kings
21:22  and forsook יהוה
Elohim of his fathers, and did not walk in the way of יהוה.

2Kings
21:23  And the servants of Amon conspired
against him, and killed the sovereign in his own house. 
2Kings
21:24  But the people of the land smote
all those who had conspired against Sovereign Amon, and the people of the land
set up his son Yoshiyahu to reign in his place. 
2Kings
21:25  And the rest of the acts of Amon
which he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the sovereigns
of Yehuḏah? 
2Kings
21:26  And he was buried in his tomb in
the garden of Uzza. And his son Yoshiyahu reigned in his place. 
2Kings
22:1  Yoshiyahu was eight years old when
he began to reign, and he reigned thirty-one years in Yerushalayim. And his
mother’s name was Yeḏiḏah the daughter of Aḏayah of Botsqath.

2Kings
22:2  And he did what was right in the
eyes of יהוה, and walked in all the ways of his father
Dawiḏ, and did not turn aside, right or left. 
2Kings
22:3  And it came to be, in the
eighteenth year of Sovereign Yoshiyahu, that the sovereign sent Shaphan the
scribe, son of Atsalyahu, son of Meshullam, to the House of יהוה,
saying, 
2Kings
22:4  “Go up to Ḥilqiyahu the high
priest, and let him weigh the silver which has been brought into the House of יהוה,
which the doorkeepers have gathered from the people. 
2Kings
22:5  “And let them give it into the hand
of those doing the work, who are the overseers in the House of יהוה.
And let them give it to those who are in the House of יהוה
doing the work, to repair the damages of the house, 
2Kings
22:6  to carpenters and to builders and
to stonemasons, and to buy timber and hewn stone to repair the house. 
2Kings
22:7  “However, let not the silver given
into their hand be reckoned with them, for they are acting trustworthily.” 
2Kings
22:8  And Ḥilqiyahu the high priest
said to Shaphan the scribe, “I have found the Book of the Torah in the House of
יהוה.” And Ḥilqiyah gave the book to Shaphan, and
he read it. 
2Kings
22:9  And Shaphan the scribe came to the
sovereign, and brought word to the sovereign again, saying, “Your servants have
gathered the silver that was found in the house, and have given it into the
hand of those who do the work, who oversee the House of יהוה.”

2Kings
22:10  And Shaphan the scribe informed
the sovereign, saying, “Ḥilqiyah the priest has given me a book.” And
Shaphan read it before the sovereign. 
2Kings
22:11  And it came to be, when the
sovereign heard the words of the Book of the Torah, that he tore his garments, 
2Kings
22:12  and the sovereign commanded Ḥilqiyah
the priest, and Aḥiqam son of Shaphan, and Aḵbor son of Miḵayah,
and Shaphan the scribe, and Asayah a servant of the sovereign, saying, 
2Kings
22:13  “Go, inquire of יהוה
for me, for the people and for all Yehuḏah, concerning the words of this
book that has been found. For great is the wrath of יהוה
that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not obeyed the words of
this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” 
2Kings
22:14  Then Ḥilqiyahu the priest,
and Aḥiqam, and Aḵbor, and Shaphan, and Asayah went to Ḥuldah
the prophetess, the wife of Shallum son of Tiqwah, son of Ḥarḥas,
keeper of the wardrobe. Now she was dwelling in Yerushalayim in the Second Quarter.
And they spoke with her. 
2Kings
22:15  And she said to them, “Thus said יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, ‘Say to the man who sent you to Me, 
2Kings
22:16  “Thus said יהוה,
‘See, I am bringing evil on this place and on its inhabitants, all the words of
the book which the sovereign of Yehuḏah has read, 
2Kings
22:17  because they have forsaken Me and
burned incense to other mighty ones to provoke Me with all the works of their
hands. And so My wrath shall be kindled against this place and not be quenched.’
” ’ 
2Kings
22:18  “And to the sovereign of Yehuḏah,
who sent you to inquire of יהוה, say this to him, ‘Thus
said יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, “As for the words
which you have heard, 
2Kings
22:19  because your heart was tender, and
you humbled yourself before יהוה when you heard what I
spoke against this place and against its inhabitants, that they would become a
ruin and a curse, and did tore your garments and wept before Me, I also have
heard,” declares יהוה. 
2Kings
22:20  “Therefore, see, I am gathering
you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace, so that
your eyes do not see all the evil I am bringing on this place.” ’ ” And they
brought word to the sovereign.
2Kings
23:1  And the sovereign sent, and they
gathered all the elders of Yehuḏah and Yerushalayim to him. 
2Kings
23:2  And the sovereign went up to the
House of יהוה with all the men of Yehuḏah, and
all the inhabitants of Yerushalayim with him, and the priests and the prophets
and all the people, both small and great. And he read in their hearing all the
words of the Book of the Covenant which had been found in the House of יהוה.

2Kings
23:3  And the sovereign stood by the
column and made a covenant before יהוה, to follow יהוה
and to guard His commands and His witnesses and His laws, with all his heart
and all his being, to establish the words of this covenant that were written in
this book. And all the people stood to the covenant. 
2Kings
23:4  Then the sovereign commanded Ḥilqiyahu
the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the doorkeepers, to
bring out of the Hĕḵal of יהוה all the
objects that were made for Ba‛al, and for Ashĕrah, and for all the
host of the heavens. And he burned them outside Yerushalayim in the fields of
Qiḏron, and took their ashes to Bĕyth Ĕl.
2Kings
23:5  And he put down the black-robed
priests whom the sovereigns of Yehuḏah had appointed to burn incense on
the high places in the cities of Yehuḏah and in the places all around
Yerushalayim, and those who burned incense to Ba‛al, to the sun, and to
the moon, and to the constellations, and to all the host of the heavens.
2Kings
23:6  And he brought out the Ashĕrah
from the House of יהוה, to the wadi Qiḏron
outside Yerushalayim, and burned it at the wadi Qiḏron and ground it to
ashes, and threw its ashes on the graves of the sons of the people.
2Kings
23:7  And he broke down the houses of the
male cult prostitutes that were in the House of יהוה,
where the women wove tapestries for the Ashĕrah. 
2Kings
23:8  And he brought all the priests from
the cities of Yehuḏah, and defiled the high places where the priests had
burned incense, from Geḇa to Be’ĕrsheḇa, and broke down the
high places at the gates which were at the entrance of the Gate of Yehoshua the
governor of the city, which were to the left of the city gate. 
2Kings
23:9  However, the priests of the high
places did not come up to the altar of יהוה in
Yerushalayim, but they ate unleavened bread among their brothers. 
2Kings
23:10  And he defiled Topheth, which is
in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, so that no man could make his son or his
daughter pass through the fire to Moleḵ. 
2Kings
23:11  And he did away with the horses
that the sovereigns of Yehuḏah had given to the sun, at the entrance to
the House of יהוה, by the room of Nathan-Meleḵ
the eunuch, that were in the court. And he burned the chariots of the sun with
fire. 
2Kings
23:12  And the altars that were on the
roof of the upper room of Aḥaz, which the sovereigns of Yehuḏah had
made, and the altars which Menashsheh had made in the two courtyards of the
House of יהוה, the sovereign broke down, and rushed
from there, and threw their dust into the wadi Qiḏron. 
2Kings
23:13  And the sovereign defiled the high
places that were before Yerushalayim, which were on the right hand of the
Mountain of Destruction, which Shelomoh sovereign of Yisra’ĕl built for
Ashtoreth the abomination of the Tsiḏonians, and for Kemosh the
abomination of the Mo’aḇites, and for Milkom the abomination of the
children of Ammon. 
2Kings
23:14  And he broke in pieces the pillars
and cut down the Ashĕrim, and filled their places with the bones of men. 
2Kings
23:15  And also the altar that was at Bĕyth
Ĕl, and the high place which Yaroḇ‛am son of Neḇat made,
by which he made Yisra’ĕl sin, both that altar and the high place he broke
down. And he burned the high place and ground it to dust, and burned the Ashĕrah.

2Kings
23:16  Then Yoshiyahu turned, and saw the
tombs that were there on the mountain. And he sent and took the bones out of
the tombs and burned them on the altar, and defiled it according to the word of
יהוה which the man of Elohim proclaimed, who proclaimed
these words. 
2Kings
23:17  And he said, “What tombstone is
this that I see?” And the men of the city said to him, “It is the tomb of the
man of Elohim who came from Yehuḏah and proclaimed these matters which
you have done against the altar of Bĕyth Ĕl.” 
2Kings
23:18  And he said, “Let him alone, let
no one move his bones.” So they left his bones alone, with the bones of the
prophet who came from Shomeron. 
2Kings
23:19  And Yoshiyahu also took away all
the houses of the high places that were in the cities of Shomeron, which the
sovereigns of Yisra’ĕl had made to provoke. And he did to them according
to all the deeds he did in Bĕyth Ĕl. 
2Kings
23:20  And he slaughtered all the priests
of the high places who were there, on the altars, and burned men’s bones on
them, and went back to Yerushalayim. 
2Kings
23:21  And the sovereign commanded all
the people, saying, “Prepare the Passover to יהוה your
Elohim, as it is written in this Book of the Covenant.” 
2Kings
23:22  For such a Passover had not been
prepared since the days of the rulers who ruled Yisra’ĕl, nor in all the
days of the sovereigns of Yisra’ĕl and the sovereigns of Yehuḏah, 
2Kings
23:23  but in the eighteenth year of
Sovereign Yoshiyahu this Passover was prepared before יהוה
in Yerushalayim. 
2Kings
23:24  And also, Yoshiyahu put away those
who consulted mediums and spiritists, and the household mighty ones and idols,
and all the abominations that were seen in the land of Yehuḏah and in
Yerushalayim, in order to establish the words of the Torah which were written
in the book that Ḥilqiyahu the priest found in the House of יהוה.
2Kings
23:25  And before him there was no
sovereign like him, who turned back to יהוה with all
his heart, and with all his being, and with all his might, according to all the
Torah of Mosheh; and after him none rose up like him. 
2Kings
23:26  However, יהוה
did not turn from the fierceness of His great wrath, with which His wrath
burned against Yehuḏah, because of all the provocations with which
Menashsheh had provoked Him. 
2Kings
23:27  And יהוה
said, “Even Yehuḏah I shall remove from My presence, as I have removed
Yisra’ĕl, and I shall reject this city Yerushalayim which I have chosen,
and the House of which I said, ‘My Name is there.’ ” 
2Kings
23:28  And the rest of the acts of
Yoshiyahu, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the annals
of the sovereigns of Yehuḏah? 
2Kings
23:29  In his days Pharaoh Neḵo
sovereign of Mitsrayim went up against the sovereign of Ashshur, to the River
Euphrates. And Sovereign Yoshiyahu went out to him, and he killed him at Meḡiddo
when he saw him. 
2Kings
23:30  And his servants conveyed his body
in a chariot from Meḡiddo, and brought him to Yerushalayim, and buried
him in his own tomb. And the people of the land took Yeho’aḥaz son of
Yoshiyahu, and anointed him, and set him up to reign in his father’s place. 
2Kings
23:31  Yeho’aḥaz was twenty-three
years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in Yerushalayim.
And his mother’s name was Ḥamutal the daughter of Yirmeyahu of Liḇnah.

2Kings
23:32  And he did evil in the eyes of יהוה,
according to all that his fathers did. 
2Kings
23:33  And Pharaoh Neḵo imprisoned
him at Riblah in the land of Ḥamath, to keep him from reigning in
Yerushalayim. And he imposed on the land a fine of one hundred talents of
silver and a talent of gold. 
2Kings
23:34  And Pharaoh Neḵo set up
Elyaqim son of Yoshiyahu to reign in place of his father Yoshiyahu, and changed
his name to Yehoyaqim. And Pharaoh took Yeho’aḥaz and went to Mitsrayim,
and he died there. 
2Kings
23:35  And Yehoyaqim gave the silver and
gold to Pharaoh. Only, he taxed the land to give silver according to the
command of Pharaoh. He exacted the silver and gold from the people of the land,
from every one according to his assessment, to give it to Pharaoh Neḵo. 
2Kings
23:36  Yehoyaqim was twenty-five years
old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Yerushalayim. And
his mother’s name was Zeḇiḏah the daughter of Peḏayah of
Rumah. 
2Kings
23:37  And he did evil in the eyes of יהוה,
according to all that his fathers did. 
2Kings
24:1  In his days Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar
sovereign of Baḇel came up, and Yehoyaqim became his servant for three
years. And he turned and rebelled against him. 
2Kings
24:2  And יהוה
sent against him raiding bands of Chaldeans, and raiding bands of Aram, and
raiding bands of Mo’aḇ, and raiding bands of the children of Ammon. And
He sent them against Yehuḏah to destroy it, according to the word of יהוה
which He had spoken by His servants the prophets. 
2Kings
24:3  Only at the command of יהוה
this came upon Yehuḏah, to remove them
from His presence, because of the sins of Menashsheh, according to all that he
did, 
2Kings
24:4  and also because of the innocent
blood that he shed. For he filled Yerushalayim with innocent blood, which יהוה
would not forgive. 
2Kings
24:5  And the rest of the acts of
Yehoyaqim, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the annals
of the sovereigns of Yehuḏah?
2Kings
24:6  So Yehoyaqim slept with his
fathers. And Yehoyaḵin his son reigned in his place. 
2Kings
24:7  And the sovereign of Mitsrayim did
not come out of his land again, for the sovereign of Baḇel had taken all
that belonged to the sovereign of Mitsrayim from the wadi of Mitsrayim to the
River Euphrates. 
2Kings
24:8  Yehoyaḵin was eighteen years
old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Yerushalayim three months. And
his mother’s name was Neḥushta the daughter of Elnathan of Yerushalayim. 
2Kings
24:9  And he did evil in the eyes of יהוה,
according to all that his father did. 
2Kings
24:10  At that time the servants of Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar
sovereign of Baḇel came up against Yerushalayim, and the city was
besieged. 
2Kings
24:11  And Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar
sovereign of Baḇel came against the city, as his servants were besieging
it. 
2Kings
24:12  And Yehoyaḵin sovereign of
Yehuḏah, and his mother, and his servants, and his heads, and his eunuchs
went out to the sovereign of Baḇel. And the sovereign of Baḇel, in
the eighth year of his reign, took him prisoner. 
2Kings
24:13  And he took from there all the
treasures of the House of יהוה and the treasures of the
sovereign’s house, and he cut in pieces all the objects of gold which Shelomoh
sovereign of Yisra’ĕl had made in the Hĕḵal of יהוה,
as יהוה had said. 
2Kings
24:14  And he exiled all Yerushalayim,
and all the officers and all the mighty brave men – ten thousand exiles – and
all the craftsmen and smiths. None remained except the poorest people of the
land. 
2Kings
24:15  And he exiled Yehoyaḵin to
Baḇel. And the sovereign’s mother, and the sovereign’s wives, and his
eunuchs, and the leading men of the land he exiled from Yerushalayim to Baḇel.

2Kings
24:16  And all the mighty brave men,
seven thousand, and craftsmen and smiths, one thousand, all who were strong and
fit for battle, these the sovereign of Baḇel brought to Baḇel into
exile. 
2Kings
24:17  And the sovereign of Baḇel
set up Mattanyah, Yehoyaḵin’s uncle, to reign in his place, and changed
his name to Tsiḏqiyahu. 
2Kings
24:18  Tsiḏqiyahu was twenty-one
years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Yerushalayim.
And his mother’s name was Ḥamutal the daughter of Yirmeyahu of Liḇnah.

2Kings
24:19  And he did evil in the eyes of יהוה,
according to all that Yehoyaqim did. 
2Kings
24:20  For this took place in
Yerushalayim and Yehuḏah because of the displeasure of יהוה,
until He had cast them out from His presence. And Tsiḏqiyahu rebelled
against the sovereign of Baḇel. 
2Kings
25:1  And it came to be in the ninth year
of his reign, in the tenth month, on the tenth of the month, that Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar
sovereign of Baḇel and all his army came against Yerushalayim and
encamped against it, and they built a siege wall against it all around. 
2Kings
25:2  And the city was besieged until the
eleventh year of Sovereign Tsiḏqiyahu. 
2Kings
25:3  By the ninth of the month the
scarcity of food had become so severe in the city that there was no food for
the people of the land. 
2Kings
25:4  Then the city wall was breached,
and all the men of battle fled at
night by way of the gate between two walls, which was by the sovereign’s
garden, even though the Chaldeans were still encamped all around against the
city. And the sovereign went by way
of the desert plain. 
2Kings
25:5  And the army of the Chaldeans
pursued the sovereign, and overtook him in the desert plains of Yeriḥo,
and all his army was scattered from him. 
2Kings
25:6  And they seized the sovereign and
brought him up to the sovereign of Baḇel at Riblah, and they pronounced
sentence on him. 
2Kings
25:7  And they slaughtered the sons of
Tsiḏqiyahu before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Tsiḏqiyahu, and
bound him with bronze shackles, and took him to Baḇel. 
2Kings
25:8  And in the fifth month, on the
seventh of the month, which was the nineteenth year of Sovereign Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar
sovereign of Baḇel, Neḇuzaraḏan the chief of the guard, a
servant of the sovereign of Baḇel, came to Yerushalayim. 
2Kings
25:9  And he burned the House of יהוה
and the house of the sovereign, and all the houses of Yerushalayim – even every
great house he burned with fire. 
2Kings
25:10  And all the army of the Chaldeans
who were with the chief of the guard broke down the walls of Yerushalayim all
around. 
2Kings
25:11  And Neḇuzaraḏan the
chief of the guard took into exile the rest of the people who were left in the
city and the deserters who deserted to the sovereign of Baḇel, with the
rest of the multitude. 
2Kings
25:12  But the chief of the guard left
some of the poor of the land as vinedressers and farmers. 
2Kings
25:13  And the bronze columns that were
in the House of יהוה, and the stands and the bronze Sea
that were in the House of יהוה, the Chaldeans broke in
pieces, and took their bronze away to Baḇel. 
2Kings
25:14  And they took the pots, and the
shovels, and the snuffers, and the ladles, and all the bronze utensils the priests
used in the service.
2Kings
25:15  And the chief of the guard took
the fire holders and the basins which were of solid gold and solid silver. 
2Kings
25:16  The bronze of all these utensils
was beyond measure – the two columns, the one Sea, and the stands, which
Shelomoh had made for the House of יהוה. 
2Kings
25:17  The height of one column was
eighteen cubits, and the capital on it was of bronze. And the height of the
capital was three cubits, and the network and pomegranates all around the
capital were all of bronze. And the second column was the same, with a network.

2Kings
25:18  And the chief of the guard took
Serayah the chief priest, and Tsephanyahu the second priest, and the three
doorkeepers. 
2Kings
25:19  And out of the city he took a certain
eunuch who was appointed over the men of battle, and five men of those who saw
the sovereign’s face, who were found in the city, and the chief scribe of the
army who mustered the people of the land, and sixty men of the people of the
land who were found in the city. 
2Kings
25:20  And Neḇuzaraḏan, chief
of the guard, took them and made them go to the sovereign of Baḇel at
Riblah. 
2Kings
25:21  And the sovereign of Baḇel
smote them and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Ḥamath. So he
exiled Yehuḏah from its own land. 
2Kings
25:22  And he appointed Geḏalyahu
son of Aḥiqam, son of Shaphan, over the people who were left in the land
of Yehuḏah, whom Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar sovereign of Baḇel
had left. 
2Kings
25:23  And all the commanders of the
armies, they and their men, heard that the sovereign of Baḇel had
appointed Geḏalyahu. And they came to Geḏalyahu at Mitspah, even
Yishma‛ĕl son of Nethanyah, and Yoḥanan son of Qarĕaḥ,
and Serayah son of Tanḥumeth the Netophathite, and Ya‛azanyahu the
son of a Ma‛aḵathite, they and their men. 
2Kings
25:24  And Geḏalyahu swore to them
and their men, and said to them, “Do not be afraid of the servants of the
Chaldeans. Dwell in the land and serve the sovereign of Baḇel, and let it
be well with you.” 
2Kings
25:25  And in the seventh month it came
to be that Yishma‛ĕl son of Nethanyah, son of Elishama, of the seed
of the reign, came with ten men and smote Geḏalyahu that he died, and the
Yehuḏim, and the Chaldeans who were with him at Mitspah. 
2Kings
25:26  And all the people rose up, small
and great, and the commanders of the armies, and went to Mitsrayim, for they
were afraid of the Chaldeans. 
2Kings
25:27  And it came to be in the
thirty-seventh year of the exile of Yehoyaḵin sovereign of Yehuḏah,
in the twelfth month, on the twenty-seventh of the month, that Ewil-Meroḏaḵ
sovereign of Baḇel, in the year that he began to reign, released Yehoyaḵin
sovereign of Yehuḏah from prison, 
2Kings
25:28  and spoke kindly to him, and set
his throne above the throne of the sovereigns who were with him in Baḇel,

2Kings
25:29  and changed his prison garments.
And he ate bread continually before the sovereign all the days of his life. 
2Kings
25:30  And as his allowance, a continual
allowance was given to him from the sovereign, a quota for each day, all the
days of his life.
