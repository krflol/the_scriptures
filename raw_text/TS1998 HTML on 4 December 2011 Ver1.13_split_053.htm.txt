Luk
12:10  “And everyone who shall speak a
word against the Son of Aḏam, it shall be forgiven him, but to him who
has blasphemed against the Set-apart Spirit, it shall not be forgiven. 
Luk
12:11  “And when they bring you to the
congregations and rulers and authorities, do not worry about how or what you
should answer, or what you should say, 
Luk
12:12  for the Set-apart Spirit shall
teach you in that very hour what you should say.” 
Luk
12:13  And someone from the crowd said to
Him, “Teacher, speak to my brother, to divide the inheritance with me.” 
Luk
12:14  But He said to him, “Man, who made
Me a judge or divider over you?” 
Luk
12:15  And He said to them, “Mind, and
beware of greed, because one’s life does not consist in the excess of his
possessions.” 
Luk
12:16  He then spoke a parable to them,
saying, “The land of a certain rich man yielded well. 
Luk
12:17  “And he was reasoning within
himself, saying, ‘What shall I do, because I have no room to store my crops?’ 
Luk
12:18  “And he said, ‘I am going to do
this: pull down my storehouses and build greater, and store all my crops and my
goods there, 
Luk
12:19  then say to myself, “Life, you
have many goods laid up for many years, take your ease, eat, drink, rejoice.” ’

Luk
12:20  “But Elohim said to him, ‘You
mindless one! This night your life shall be demanded from you. And who shall
own what you have prepared?’ 
Luk
12:21  “So is he who is storing up
treasure for himself, and is not rich toward Elohim.” 
Luk
12:22  And He said to His taught ones, “For
this reason I say to you, do not worry about your life, what you shall eat; nor
about the body, what you shall put on. 
Luk
12:23  “The life is more than the food,
and the body is more than the clothing. 
Luk
12:24  “Look at the ravens, for they
neither sow nor reap, which have neither storehouse nor granary, and Elohim
feeds them. How much more valuable are you than the birds? 
Luk
12:25  “And which of you by worrying is
able to add one cubit to his life’s span? 
Luk
12:26  “If then you are unable to do the
least, why do you worry about the rest? 
Luk
12:27  “Look at the lilies, how they
grow. They neither toil nor spin, and I say to you, even Shelomoh in all his
esteem was not dressed like one of these. 
Luk
12:28  “And if Elohim so clothes the
grass, which today exists in the field and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace,
how much more you, O you of little belief? 
Luk
12:29  “And do not seek what you shall
eat or what you shall drink, and do not keep worrying. 
Luk
12:30  “For the gentiles of the world
seek all these, and your Father knows that you need these. 
Luk
12:31  “But seek the reign of Elohim, and
all these shall be added to you. 
Luk
12:32  “Do not fear, little flock,
because your Father did delight to give you the reign. 
Luk
12:33  “Sell your possessions and give in
kindness. Make yourselves purses which do not grow old, a treasure in the
heavens that does not fail, where no thief does come near nor moth destroys. 
Luk
12:34  “For where your treasure is, there
your heart shall be also. 
Luk
12:35  “Let your loins be girded and your
lamps burning, 
Luk
12:36  and be like men waiting for their
master, when he shall return from the wedding, that when he comes and knocks
they open to him immediately. 
Luk
12:37  “Blessed are those servants whom
the master, when he comes, shall find watching. Truly, I say to you that he
shall gird himself and make them sit down to eat, and shall come and serve
them. 
Luk
12:38  “And if he comes in the second
watch, or in the third watch, and find them so, blessed are those servants. 
Luk
12:39  “And know this, that if the master
of the house had known what hour the thief comes, he would have watched and not
allowed his house to be broken into. 
Luk
12:40  “And you, then, be ready, for the
Son of Aḏam is coming at an hour you do not expect.” 
Luk
12:41  And Kĕpha said to Him, “Master,
do You speak this parable to us, or also to all?” 
Luk
12:42  And the Master said, “Who then is
the trustworthy and wise manager, whom his master shall appoint over his
household, to give the portion of food in due season? 
Luk
12:43  “Blessed is that servant whom his
master shall find so doing when he comes. 
Luk
12:44  “Truly, I say to you that he shall
appoint him over all his possessions. 
Luk
12:45  “But if that servant says in his
heart, ‘My master is delaying his coming,’ and begins to beat the male servants
and female servants, and to eat and drink and be drunk, 
Luk
12:46  the master of that servant shall
come on a day when he does not expect him, and at an hour that he does not
know, and shall cut him in two and appoint his portion with the unbelievers. 
Luk
12:47  “And that servant who knew his
master’s desire, and did not prepare, nor did according to his desire, shall be
beaten with many stripes. 
Luk
12:48  “But he who did not know, yet did
what deserved flogging, shall be beaten with few. And everyone to whom much is
given, from him much shall be demanded. And to whom much has been entrusted,
from him much more shall be asked. 
Luk
12:49  “I came to send fire on the earth,
and how I wish it were already kindled! 
Luk
12:50  “But I have an immersion to be
immersed with, and how distressed I am until it is accomplished! 
Luk
12:51  “Do you think that I came to give
peace on earth? I say to you, no, but rather division. 
Luk
12:52  “For from now on five in one house
shall be divided, three against two, and two against three – 
Luk
12:53  father shall be divided against
son, and son against father, mother against daughter, and daughter against
mother, mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and daughter-in-law against
her mother-in-law.” 
Luk
12:54  And He also said to the crowds, “When
you see a cloud rising out of the west, immediately you say, ‘A storm is
coming,’ and so it is. 
Luk
12:55  “And when you see the south wind
blow, you say, ‘There shall be hot weather,’ and it is. 
Luk
12:56  “Hypocrites! You know to discern
the face of the heaven and of the earth, but how is it you do not discern this
time? 
Luk
12:57  “And why, also, do you not judge
for yourselves what is right? 
Luk
12:58  “For, as you go with your opponent
to a ruler, try hard along the way to settle with him, lest he drag you to the
judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and the officer throw you into
prison. 
Luk
12:59  “I say to you, you shall certainly
not leave there until you have paid even the last mite.” 
Luk
13:1  And some were present at that time,
reporting to Him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their
offerings. 
Luk
13:2  And יהושע
answering, said to them, “Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners
than all other Galileans, because
they have suffered like this? 
Luk
13:3  “I say to you, no! But unless you
repent you shall all perish in the same way. 
Luk
13:4  “Or those eighteen on whom the
tower in Shiloaḥ fell and killed them, do you think that they were
greater offenders than all other men who dwelt in Yerushalayim? 
Luk
13:5  “I say to you, no! But unless you
repent you shall all perish in the same way.” 
Luk
13:6  And He spoke this parable, “A
certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came seeking fruit
on it and found none. 
Luk
13:7  “And he said to the gardener, ‘Look,
for three years I have come seeking fruit on this fig tree and find none. Cut
it down, why does it even make the ground useless?’ 
Luk
13:8  “And he answering, said to him, ‘Master,
leave it this year too, until I dig around it and throw manure. 
Luk
13:9  ‘And if indeed it bears fruit, good. But if not so, you shall cut it
down.’ ” 
Luk
13:10  And He was teaching in one of the
congregations on the Sabbath, 
Luk
13:11  and see, there was a woman having
a weakening spirit for eighteen years, and was bent over and was unable to
straighten up at all. 
Luk
13:12  And יהושע,
seeing her, called her near and said to her, “Woman, you are loosened from your
weakness.” 
Luk
13:13  And He laid His hands on her, and
immediately she was straightened up, and praised Elohim. 
Luk
13:14  But the ruler of the congregation,
responding, much displeased that יהושע had healed
on the Sabbath, said to the crowd, “There are six days on which men should
work, so come and be healed on them, and not on the Sabbath day.” 
Luk
13:15  Then the Master answered him and
said, “Hypocrite! Does not each one of you on the Sabbath loosen his ox or his
donkey from the stall, and lead it away to water it? 
Luk
13:16  “And this one, being a daughter of
Aḇraham, whom Satan has bound, look, for eighteen years, should she not be
loosened from this bond on the Sabbath?” 
Luk
13:17  And when He said this, all His
opponents were put to shame. And all the crowd rejoiced for all the splendid works being done by Him. 
Luk
13:18  Therefore He said, “What is the
reign of Elohim like? And to what shall I compare it? 
Luk
13:19  “It is like a mustard seed, which
a man took and threw into his garden. And it grew and became a large tree, and
the birds of the heavens nested in its branches.” 
Luk
13:20  And again He said, “To what shall
I compare the reign of Elohim? 
Luk
13:21  “It is like leaven, which a woman
took and hid in three measures of flour until it was all leavened.” 
Luk
13:22  And He was going through the
cities and villages, teaching, and journeying toward Yerushalayim, 
Luk
13:23  and someone said to Him, “Master,
are there few who are being saved?” And He said to them, 
Luk
13:24  “Strive to enter through the
narrow gate, because many, I say to you, shall seek to enter in and shall not
be able. 
Luk
13:25  “When once the Master of the house
has risen up and shut the door, and you begin to stand outside and knock at the
door, saying, ‘Master, Master, open for us,’ and He shall answer and say to
you, ‘I do not know you, where you are from,’ 
Luk
13:26  then you shall begin to say, ‘We
ate and drank in Your presence, and You taught in our streets.’ 
Luk
13:27  “But He shall say, ‘I say to you I
do not know you, where you are from. Depart from Me, all you workers of
unrighteousness.’ 
Luk
13:28  “There shall be weeping and
gnashing of teeth, when you see Aḇraham and Yitsḥaq and Ya‛aqoḇ
and all the prophets in the reign of Elohim, and yourselves thrown outside. 
Luk
13:29  “And they shall come from the east
and the west, and from the north and the south, and sit down in the reign of
Elohim. 
Luk
13:30  “And see, there are last who shall
be first, and there are first who shall be last.” 
Luk
13:31  On the same day there came certain
Pharisees, saying to Him, “Get out and go from here, for Herodes wishes to kill
You.” 
Luk
13:32  And He said to them, “Go, say to
that fox, ‘See, I cast out demons and perform healings today and tomorrow, and
the third day I shall be perfected.’ 
Luk
13:33  “But I have to journey today, and
tomorrow, and the day following, because it is not fitting for a prophet to
perish outside of Yerushalayim. 
Luk
13:34  “Yerushalayim, Yerushalayim,
killing the prophets and stoning those who are sent to her! How often I wished
to gather your children together, the way a hen gathers her chickens under her wings, but you would not! 
Luk
13:35  “See, your House is left to you
laid waste. And truly I say to you, you shall by no means see Me until the time comes when you say, ‘Blessed is
He who is coming in the Name of יהוה !’ ” 
Luk
14:1  And it came to be, as He went into
the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees to eat bread on the Sabbath,
that they were watching Him closely. 
Luk
14:2  And see, there was a certain man
before Him suffering from dropsy. 
Luk
14:3  And יהושע
responding, spoke to those learned in the Torah and the Pharisees, saying, “Is
it right to heal on the Sabbath?” 
Luk
14:4  But they were silent. So taking
hold of him He healed him, and let him go. 
Luk
14:5  And to them He said, “Which of you,
having a donkey or an ox that has fallen into a pit, shall not immediately pull
him out on the Sabbath day?” 
Luk
14:6  And they were unable to answer Him
regarding these matters. 
Luk
14:7  And He spoke a parable to those who
were invited, when He noted how they chose the best places, saying to them: 
Luk
14:8  “When you are invited by anyone to
a wedding feast, do not sit down in the best place, lest one more distinguished
than you be invited by him, 
Luk
14:9  and he who invited you and him come
and say to you, ‘Give this one place,’ and then you begin with shame to take
the last place. 
Luk
14:10  “Rather, when you are invited, go
and sit down in the last place, so that when he who invited you comes he shall
say to you, ‘Friend, come up higher.’ Then you shall have esteem in the
presence of those who sit at the table with you. 
Luk
14:11  “For everyone who is exalting
himself shall be humbled, and he who is humbling himself shall be exalted.” 
Luk
14:12  And He also said to him who
invited Him, “When you give a dinner or a supper, do not ask your friends, nor
your brothers, nor your relatives, nor your rich neighbours, lest they also
invite you back, and you be repaid. 
Luk
14:13  “But when you give a feast, invite
poor ones, crippled ones, lame ones, blind ones, 
Luk
14:14  and you shall be blessed, because
they do not have to repay you. For you shall be repaid at the resurrection of
the righteous.” 
Luk
14:15  And when one of those who sat at
the table with Him heard this, he said to Him, “Blessed is he who eats bread in
the reign of Elohim!” 
Luk
14:16  But He said to him, “A certain man
gave a great supper and invited many, 
Luk
14:17  and he sent his servant at supper
time to say to those who were invited, ‘Come, for all is now ready.’ 
Luk
14:18  “But one by one they all began
making excuses. The first said to him, ‘I have bought a field, and I need to go
and see it. I ask you to have me excused.’ 
Luk
14:19  “And another said, ‘I have bought
five yoke of oxen, and I am going to try them out. I ask you to have me
excused.’ 
Luk
14:20  “And another said, ‘I have married
a wife, and because of this I am unable to come.’ 
Luk
14:21  “And that servant came and
reported this to his master. Then the master of the house, being wroth, said to
his servant, ‘Hurry out into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in
here the poor, and crippled, and lame, and blind.’ 
Luk
14:22  “And the servant said, ‘Master, it
is done as you commanded, and still there is room.’ 
Luk
14:23  “And the master said to the
servant, ‘Go out into the street corners and hedges, and compel them to come
in, so that my house is filled. 
Luk
14:24  ‘For I say to you that none of
those men who were invited shall taste my supper.’ ” 
Luk
14:25  And large crowds were going with
Him, and turning, He said to them, 
Luk
14:26  “If anyone comes to Me and does
not hate his father and mother, and wife, and children, and brothers, and
sisters, and his own life too, he is unable to be My taught one. 
Luk
14:27  “And whoever does not bear his
stake and come after Me is unable to be My taught one. 
Luk
14:28  “For who of you, wishing to build
a tower, does not sit down first and count the cost, whether he has enough to complete it? 
Luk
14:29  “Otherwise, when he has laid the
foundation, and is unable to finish it, all who see it begin to mock him, 
Luk
14:30  saying, ‘This man began to build
and was unable to finish.’ 
Luk
14:31  “Or what sovereign, going to fight
against another sovereign, does not sit down first and take counsel whether he
is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty
thousand? 
Luk
14:32  “And if not, while the other is
still far away, he sends a delegation and asks conditions of peace. 
Luk
14:33  “So, then, everyone of you who
does not give up all that he has, is unable to be My taught one. 
Luk
14:34  “The salt is good, but if the salt
becomes tasteless, with what shall it be seasoned? 
Luk
14:35  “It is not fit for land, nor for
manure, they throw it out. He who has ears to hear, let him hear!” 
Luk
15:1  Now all the tax collectors and the
sinners were coming to Him to hear Him. 
Luk
15:2  And the Pharisees and scribes
grumbled, saying, “This One receives sinners and eats with them.” 
Luk
15:3  And He spoke this parable to them,
saying, 
Luk
15:4  “What man among you, having a
hundred sheep, and having lost one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in
the wilderness and go after the one which is lost until he finds it? 
Luk
15:5  “And having found it, he lays it on
his shoulders, rejoicing. 
Luk
15:6  “And having come home, he calls
together his friends and neighbours, saying to them, ‘Rejoice with me, for I
have found my sheep which was lost!’ 
Luk
15:7  “I say to you that in the same way
there shall be more joy in the heaven over one sinner repenting, than over ninety-nine
righteous ones who need no repentance. 
Luk
15:8  “Or what woman, having ten silver
coins, if she loses one coin, does not light a lamp and sweep the house, and
seek diligently till she finds it? 
Luk
15:9  “And having found it, she calls
friends and neighbours together, saying, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found the
coin which I lost!’ 
Luk
15:10  “I say to you, in the same way
there is joy in the presence of the messengers of Elohim over one sinner
repenting.” 
Luk
15:11  And He said, “A certain man had
two sons, 
Luk
15:12  and the younger of them said to
his father, ‘Father, give me the portion of goods falling to me.’ And he divided his livelihood between them. 
Luk
15:13  “And not many days after, the
younger son, having gathered all together, went away to a distant country, and
there wasted his goods with loose living. 
Luk
15:14  “And when he had spent all, there
arose a severe scarcity of food throughout that land, and he began to be in
need. 
Luk
15:15  “And he went and joined himself to
one of the citizens of that country, and he sent him to his fields to feed
pigs. 
Luk
15:16  “And he was longing to fill his
stomach with the pods which the pigs were eating, and no one gave to him. 
Luk
15:17  “But having come to himself, he
said, ‘How many of my father’s hired servants have bread enough and to spare,
and I am perishing with hunger! 
Luk
15:18  ‘Having risen, I shall go to my
father and say to him, “Father, I have sinned against the heaven, and before
you, 
Luk
15:19  and I am no longer worthy to be
called your son. Make me like one of your hired servants.” ’ 
Luk
15:20  “And having risen, he went to his
father. And while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was moved
with compassion, and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him. 
Luk
15:21  “And the son said to him, ‘Father,
I have sinned against the heaven, and before you, and I am no longer worthy to
be called your son.’ 
Luk
15:22  “But the father said to his
servants, ‘Bring out the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his
hand and sandals on his feet. 
Luk
15:23  ‘And bring the fattened calf here
and slaughter it, and let us eat and rejoice, 
Luk
15:24  because this son of mine was dead
and is alive again, and he was lost and is found.’ And they began to rejoice. 
Luk
15:25  “And his older son was in the
field, and when he came and approached the house, he heard music and dancing. 
Luk
15:26  “And having called one of the
servants he asked what this meant. 
Luk
15:27  “And he said to him, ‘Your brother
has come, and your father has slaughtered the fattened calf because he received
him back in health.’ 
Luk
15:28  “And he was wroth and would not go
in. So his father came out and pleaded with him. 
Luk
15:29  “And answering, he said to his
father, ‘See, these many years I have been serving you, and I have never
transgressed a command of yours, but to me you have never given a young goat,
so I could rejoice with my friends. 
Luk
15:30  ‘But when this son of yours came,
who has devoured your livelihood with whores, you slaughtered the fattened calf
for him.’ 
Luk
15:31  “Then he said to him, ‘Son, you
are always with me, and all I have is yours. 
Luk
15:32  ‘And we had to rejoice and be
glad, for your brother was dead and is alive, and was lost and is found.’ ” 
Luk
16:1  And He also said to His taught
ones, “There was a certain rich man who had a manager and he was accused to him
as wasting his possessions. 
Luk
16:2  “So having called him he said to
him, ‘What is this I hear about you? Give an account of your management, for
you are no longer able to be manager.’ 
Luk
16:3  “And the manager said within
himself, ‘What shall I do? For my master is taking the managership away from
me. I am unable to dig, I am ashamed to beg. 
Luk
16:4  ‘I know what I shall do, that, when
I am removed from the managership, they might receive me into their houses.’ 
Luk
16:5  “And calling every one of his
master’s debtors to him, he said to the first, ‘How much do you owe my master?’

Luk
16:6  “And he said, ‘A hundred measures
of oil.’ And he said to him, ‘Take your bill, and sit down quickly and write
fifty.’ 
Luk
16:7  “Then to another he said, ‘And how
much do you owe?’ And he said, ‘A hundred measures of wheat.’ And he said to
him, ‘Take your bill, and write eighty.’ 
Luk
16:8  “And the master praised the
unrighteous manager because he had acted shrewdly, because the sons of this age
are more shrewd in their generation than the sons of light. 
Luk
16:9  “And would I say to you, make
friends for yourselves by unrighteous mammon, that when you fail, they shall
receive you into everlasting dwellings? 
Luk
16:10  “He who is trustworthy in what is
least, is trustworthy also in much. And he who is unrighteous in what is least
is unrighteous also in much. 
Luk
16:11  “If, therefore, you have not been
trustworthy in the unrighteous mammon, who shall entrust to you the true? 
Luk
16:12  “And if you have not been
trustworthy in what is another man’s, who shall give you what is your own? 
Luk
16:13  “No servant is able to serve two
masters, for either he shall hate the one and love the other, or else he shall
cling to the one and despise the other. You are not able to serve Elohim and
mammon.” 
Luk
16:14  And the Pharisees, who loved
silver, also heard all this, and were sneering at Him, 
Luk
16:15  so He said to them, “You are those
who declare yourselves righteous before men, but Elohim knows your hearts,
because what is highly thought of among men is an abomination in the sight of
Elohim. 
Luk
16:16  “The Torah and the prophets are
until Yoḥanan. Since then the reign of Elohim is being announced, and
everyone is doing violence upon it. 
Luk
16:17  “And it is easier for the heaven
and the earth to pass away than for one tittle of the Torah to fall. 
Luk
16:18  “Everyone putting away his wife
and marrying another commits adultery. And everyone marrying her who is put
away from her husband commits adultery. 
Luk
16:19  “But there was a certain rich man
who used to dress in purple and fine linen and lived luxuriously every day. 
Luk
16:20  “And there was a certain beggar
named El‛azar, being covered with sores, who was placed at his gate, 
Luk
16:21  and longing to be fed with the
crumbs which fell from the rich man’s table. Indeed, even the dogs came and licked
his sores. 
Luk
16:22  “And it came to be that the beggar
died, and was carried by the messengers to the bosom of Aḇraham. And the
rich man also died and was buried. 
Luk
16:23  “And while suffering tortures in
the grave, having lifted up his eyes, he saw Aḇraham far away, and El‛azar
in his bosom. 
Luk
16:24  “And crying out he said, ‘Father Aḇraham,
have compassion on me, and send El‛azar to dip the tip of his finger in
water and cool my tongue, for I am suffering in this flame.’ 
Luk
16:25  “But Aḇraham said, ‘Son,
remember that in your life you received your good, and likewise El‛azar
the evil, but now he is comforted and you are suffering. 
Luk
16:26  ‘And besides all this, between us
and you a great chasm has been set, so that those who wish to pass from here to
you are unable, nor do those from there pass to us.’ 
Luk
16:27  “And he said, ‘Then I beg you,
father, that you would send him to my father’s house, 
Luk
16:28  for I have five brothers, let him
warn them, lest they also come to this place of torture.’ 
Luk
16:29  “Aḇraham said to him, ‘They
have Mosheh and the prophets, let them hear them.’ 
Luk
16:30  “And he said, ‘No, father Aḇraham,
but if someone from the dead goes to them, they shall repent.’ 
Luk
16:31  “But he said to him, ‘If they do
not hear Mosheh and the prophets, neither would they be persuaded even if one
should rise from the dead.’ ” 
Luk
17:1  And He said to the taught ones, “It
is inevitable that stumbling-blocks should come, but woe to him through whom
they come! 
Luk
17:2  “It would be better for him if a
millstone is put around his neck, and he were thrown into the sea, than that he
should cause one of these little ones to stumble. 
Luk
17:3  “Take heed to yourselves. If your
brother sins against you, rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive him. 
Luk
17:4  “And if he sins against you seven
times in a day, and seven times in a day comes back to you, saying, ‘I repent,’
you shall forgive him.” 
Luk
17:5  And the emissaries said to the
Master, “Give us more belief.” 
Luk
17:6  And the Master said, “If you have
belief as a mustard seed, you would say to this mulberry tree, ‘Be pulled up by
the roots and be planted in the sea,’ and it would obey you. 
Luk
17:7  “But who of you, having a servant
ploughing or shepherding, would say to him when he has come in from the field, ‘Come
immediately and sit down to eat’? 
Luk
17:8  “But would he not rather say to
him, ‘Prepare somewhat for my supper, and gird yourself and serve me while I
eat and drink, and afterward you shall eat and drink’? 
Luk
17:9  “Would he thank that servant
because he did what he was commanded? I think not. 
Luk
17:10  “So also you, when you have done
all that you were commanded, say, ‘We are unworthy servants, we have done what
was our duty to do.’ ” 
Luk
17:11  And it came to be, as He went to
Yerushalayim, that He passed through the midst of Shomeron and Galil. 
Luk
17:12  And as He was entering into a
certain village, He was met by ten leprous men, who stood at a distance. 
Luk
17:13  And they lifted up their voices,
saying, “ יהושע, Master, have compassion on us!” 
Luk
17:14  And having seen them, He said to them, “Go, show
yourselves to the priests.” And it came to be, that as they were going, they
were cleansed. 
Luk
17:15  And one of them, when he saw that
he was healed, returned, praising Elohim with a loud voice, 
Luk
17:16  and he fell down upon his face at
His feet, giving thanks to Him. And he was a Shomeronite. 
Luk
17:17  And יהושע
answering, said, “Were there not ten cleansed? But where are the nine? 
Luk
17:18  “Was no one found to return to
give praise to Elohim, except this foreigner?” 
Luk
17:19  And He said to him, “Rise, go your
way. Your belief has made you well.” 
Luk
17:20  And having been asked by the
Pharisees when the reign of Elohim would come, He answered them and said, “The
reign of Elohim does not come with intent watching, 
Luk
17:21  nor shall they say, ‘Look here!’
or ‘Look there!’ For look, the reign of Elohim is in your midst!” 
Luk
17:22  And He said to the taught ones, “Days
shall come when you shall long to see one of the days of the Son of Aḏam,
but you shall not see it. 
Luk
17:23  “And they shall say to you, ‘Look
here!’ or ‘Look there!’ Do not go after them, nor follow. 
Luk
17:24  “For as the lightning that flashes
out of one part under heaven shines to the other part under heaven, so also the
Son of Aḏam shall be in His day. 
Luk
17:25  “But first He has to suffer much
and be rejected by this generation. 
Luk
17:26  “And as it came to be in the days
of Noaḥ, so also shall it be in the days of the Son of Aḏam: 
Luk
17:27  “They were eating, they were
drinking, they were marrying, they were given in marriage, until the day that
Noaḥ went into the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all. 
Luk
17:28  “And likewise, as it came to be in
the days of Lot: They were eating, they were drinking, they were buying, they
were selling, they were planting, they were building, 
Luk
17:29  but on the day Lot went out of Seḏom
it rained fire and sulphur from heaven and destroyed all. 
Luk
17:30  “It shall be the same in the day
the Son of Aḏam is revealed. 
Luk
17:31  “In that day, he who shall be on
the house-top, and his goods in the house, let him not come down to take them
away. And likewise the one who is in the field, let him not turn back. 
Luk
17:32  “Remember the wife of Lot. 
Luk
17:33  “Whoever seeks to save his life
shall lose it, and whoever loses his life shall preserve it. 
Luk
17:34  “I say to you, in that night there
shall be two in one bed, the one shall be taken and the other shall be left. 
Luk
17:35  “Two shall be grinding together,
the one shall be taken and the other shall be left. 
Luk
17:36  “Two shall be in the field, the
one shall be taken and the other shall be left.” 
Luk
17:37  And they answering, said to Him, “Where,
Master?” And He said to them, “Where the body is, there also the eagles shall
be gathered together.” 
Luk
18:1  And He spoke a parable to them,
that they should always pray and not lose heart, 
Luk
18:2  saying, “In a certain city there
was a certain judge, not fearing Elohim nor regarding man. 
Luk
18:3  “And a widow was in that city, and
she came to him, saying, ‘Do right to me on my adversary.’ 
Luk
18:4  “And he would not for a while, but
afterward he said within himself, ‘Even if I do not fear Elohim nor regard man,

Luk
18:5  yet because this widow troubles me
I shall do right to her, lest by her continual coming she wears me out.’ ” 
Luk
18:6  And the Master said, “Hear what the
unrighteous judge said. 
Luk
18:7  “And shall Elohim not do right by
all means to His own chosen ones who are crying out day and night to Him, and
being patient over them? 
Luk
18:8  “I say to you that He shall do
right to them speedily. But when the Son of Aḏam comes, shall He find the
belief on the earth?” 
Luk
18:9  And He also spoke this parable to
some who relied on themselves that they were righteous, and looking down on
others: 
Luk
18:10  “Two men went up to the Set-apart
Place to pray – the one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. 
Luk
18:11  “The Pharisee stood and began to
pray with himself this way, ‘Elohim, I thank You that I am not like the rest of
men, swindlers, unrighteous, adulterers, or even as this tax collector. 
Luk
18:12  ‘I fast twice a week, I give
tithes of all that I possess.’ 
Luk
18:13  “But the tax collector standing at
a distance would not even raise his eyes to the heaven, but was beating his
breast, saying, ‘Elohim, show favour unto me, a sinner!’ 
Luk
18:14  “I say to you, this man went down
to his house declared right, rather than the other. For everyone who is
exalting himself shall be humbled, and he who is humbling himself shall be
exalted.” 
Luk
18:15  And they also brought infants to
Him to touch them, but His taught ones seeing it, rebuked them. 
Luk
18:16  But יהושע
called them to Him and said, “Let the little children come to Me, and do not
forbid them, for of such is the reign of Elohim. 
Luk
18:17  “Truly, I say to you, whoever does
not receive the reign of Elohim as a little child, shall certainly not enter
into it.” 
Luk
18:18  And a certain ruler asked Him,
saying, “Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit everlasting life?” 
Luk
18:19  So יהושע
said to him, “Why do you call Me good? No one is good except One – Elohim. 
Luk
18:20  “You know the commands, ‘Do not
commit adultery,’ ‘Do not murder,’ ‘Do not steal,’ ‘Do not bear false witness,’
‘Respect your father and your mother.’ ” 
Luk
18:21  And he said, “All these I have
watched over from my youth.” 
Luk
18:22  And hearing this, יהושע
said to him, “Yet one you lack: Sell all that you have and distribute to the
poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven. And come, follow Me.” 
Luk
18:23  But when he heard this, he became
intensely sad, for he was extremely rich. 
Luk
18:24  And when יהושע
saw that he became intensely sad, He said, “How hard it is for those who have
riches to enter into the reign of Elohim! 
Luk
18:25  “For it is easier for a camel to
enter through a needle’s eye than for a rich man to enter into the reign of
Elohim.” 
Luk
18:26  And those who heard it said, “And
who is able to be saved?” 
Luk
18:27  And He said, “What is impossible
with men is possible with Elohim.” 
Luk
18:28  And Kĕpha said, “See, we have
left all and followed You.” 
Luk
18:29  And He said to them, “Truly, I say
to you, there is no one who has left house or parents or brothers or wife or
children, for the sake of the reign of Elohim, 
Luk
18:30  who shall not receive many times
more in this present time, and in the age to come everlasting life.” 
Luk
18:31  And taking the twelve aside, He
said to them, “See, we are going up to Yerushalayim, and all that have been
written by the prophets about the Son of Aḏam shall be accomplished. 
Luk
18:32  “For He shall be delivered up to
the gentiles and shall be mocked and insulted and spat upon, 
Luk
18:33  and having flogged Him they shall
kill Him. And on the third day He shall rise again.” 
Luk
18:34  But they understood none of this,
and this word was hidden from them, and they did not know what was being said. 
Luk
18:35  And it came to be, that as He was
coming near Yeriḥo, that a certain blind man was sitting by the way
begging. 
Luk
18:36  And hearing a crowd passing by, he
asked what it meant. 
Luk
18:37  And they reported to him that יהושע
of Natsareth was passing by. 
Luk
18:38  And he cried out, saying, “ יהושע,
Son of Dawiḏ, have compassion on me!” 
Luk
18:39  And those going before were
rebuking him that he should be silent, but he was crying out much more, “Son of
Dawiḏ, have compassion on me!” 
Luk
18:40  And יהושע
stopped and commanded him to be brought to Him. And when he had come near, He
asked him, 
Luk
18:41  saying, “What do you wish Me to do
for you?” And he said, “Master, to receive my sight.” 
Luk
18:42  And יהושע
said to him, “Receive your sight! Your belief has saved you.” 
Luk
18:43  And immediately he received his
sight, and was following Him, praising Elohim. And all the people, seeing it,
gave praise to Elohim. 
Luk
19:1  And having entered, He was passing
through Yeriḥo. 
Luk
19:2  And see, a man called Zakkai! And
he was a chief tax collector, and he was rich, 
Luk
19:3  and he was seeking to see who יהושע
was, but was unable because of the crowd, for he was small in stature. 
Luk
19:4  And having run ahead, he climbed up
into a sycamore tree to see Him, because He was about to pass by. 
Luk
19:5  And as יהושע
came to the place, He looked up and saw him, and said to him, “Zakkai, hurry
and come down, for I have to stay at your house today.” 
Luk
19:6  And he hurried and came down, and
received Him, rejoicing. 
Luk
19:7  And seeing it, they all grumbled,
saying, “He has gone in to stay with a man who is a sinner.” 
Luk
19:8  But Zakkai stood up and said to the
Master, “Look, Master, I give half of my possessions to the poor. And if I have
taken whatever from anyone by false accusation, I repay fourfold.” 
Luk
19:9  And יהושע
said to him, “Today deliverance has come to this house – since he also is a son
of Aḇraham. 
Luk
19:10  “For the Son of Aḏam has
come to seek and to save what was lost.” 
Luk
19:11  And as they were hearing this, He
spoke another parable, because He was near Yerushalayim and they thought the
reign of Elohim was about to be manifested straightaway. 
Luk
19:12  He therefore said, “A certain
nobleman went to a distant country to receive for himself a reign and to
return. 
Luk
19:13  “And calling ten of his servants,
He gave them ten minas, and said to them, ‘Trade until I come.’ 
Luk
19:14  “But his subjects were hating him,
and sent a delegation after him, to say, ‘We do not wish this one to reign over
us.’ 
Luk
19:15  “And it came to be, when he came
back, having received the reign, that he sent for these servants to whom he had
given the silver, in order to know what each had gained by trading. 
Luk
19:16  “And the first came, saying, ‘Master,
your mina has earned ten minas.’ 
Luk
19:17  “And he said to him, ‘Well done,
good servant. Because you were trustworthy in a small matter, have authority over ten cities.’ 
Luk
19:18  “And the second came, saying, ‘Master,
your mina has earned five minas.’ 
Luk
19:19  “And he said to him also, ‘And you
– be over five cities.’ 
Luk
19:20  “And another came, saying, ‘Master,
here is your mina, which I kept laid up in a handkerchief. 
Luk
19:21  ‘For I was afraid of you, because
you are a hard man. You take up what you did not lay down, and reap what you
did not sow.’ 
Luk
19:22  “And he said to him, ‘Out of your
own mouth I shall judge you, you wicked servant. You knew that I was a hard
man, taking up what I did not lay down and reaping what I did not sow. 
Luk
19:23  ‘Why did you not put the silver in
the bank, that when I come I could have collected it with interest?’ 
Luk
19:24  “Then he said to those who stood
by, ‘Take the mina from him, and give it to him who possesses ten minas.’ 
Luk
19:25  “But they said to him, ‘Master, he
already possesses ten minas.’ 
Luk
19:26  ‘For I say to you, that to
everyone who possesses shall be given; and from him who does not possess, even
what he possesses shall be taken away from him. 
Luk
19:27  ‘But those enemies of mine who did
not wish me to reign over them, bring them here and slay them before me.’ ” 
Luk
19:28  And having said this, He went on
ahead, going up to Yerushalayim. 
Luk
19:29  And it came to be, when He came
near to Bĕyth Phaḡi and Bĕyth Anyah, at the mountain of Olives,
that He sent two of His taught ones, 
Luk
19:30  saying, “Go into the village
opposite you, in which, as you enter, you shall find a colt tied, on which no
one has ever sat. Loosen it and bring it here. 
Luk
19:31  “And if anyone asks you, ‘Why do
you loosen it?’ thus you shall say to him, ‘Because the Master has need of it.’
” 
Luk
19:32  And those who were sent went away
and found it as He had said to them. 
Luk
19:33  And as they were loosing the colt,
the owners of it said to them, “Why do you loosen the colt?” 
Luk
19:34  And they said, “The Master needs
it.” 
Luk
19:35  So they brought it to יהושע.
And throwing their garments on the colt, they set יהושע
on it. 
Luk
19:36  And as He went, they were
spreading their garments on the way. 
Luk
19:37  And as He was coming near, already
at the descent of the Mount of Olives, the entire crowd of the taught ones
began, to praise Elohim, rejoicing with a loud voice for all the miracles they
had seen, 
Luk
19:38  saying, “ ‘Blessed is the
Sovereign who is coming in the Name of יהוה !’ Peace in
heaven and esteem in the highest!” 
Luk
19:39  And some of the Pharisees from the
crowd, said to Him, “Teacher, rebuke Your taught ones.” 
Luk
19:40  But He answering, said to them, “I
say to you that if these shall be silent, the stones would cry out.” 
Luk
19:41  And as He came near, He saw the
city and wept over it, 
Luk
19:42  saying, “If you only knew even
today, the matters for your peace!
But now they are hidden from your eyes. 
Luk
19:43  “Because days shall come upon you
when your enemies shall build a rampart around you, and surround you and press
you on all sides, 
Luk
19:44  and dash you to the ground, and
your children within you. And they shall not leave in you one stone upon
another, because you did not know the time of your visitation.” 
Luk
19:45  And having entered into the
Set-apart Place, He began to drive out those selling and buying in it, 
Luk
19:46  saying to them, “It has been
written, ‘My House is a house of prayer,’ but you have made it a ‘den of
robbers.’ ” 
Luk
19:47  And He was teaching daily in the
Set-apart Place. But the chief priests, and the scribes, and the leaders of the
people were seeking to destroy Him, 
Luk
19:48  but they did not find what they
might do, for all the people were hanging upon Him, listening. 
Luk
20:1  And it came to be, on one of those
days, as He was teaching the people in the Set-apart Place and bringing the
Good News, that the chief priests and the scribes, together with the elders,
came up 
Luk
20:2  and spoke to Him, saying, “Say to
us, by what authority are You doing these? Or who is he who gave You this
authority?” 
Luk
20:3  And He answering, said to them, “I
shall ask you one question too, and answer Me: 
Luk
20:4  “The immersion of Yoḥanan –
was it from heaven or from men?” 
Luk
20:5  And they debated among themselves,
saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ He shall say, ‘Then why did you not believe
him?’ 
Luk
20:6  “But if we say, ‘From men,’ all the
people shall stone us, for they are persuaded that Yoḥanan was a prophet.”

Luk
20:7  And they answered that they did not
know from where it was. 
Luk
20:8  And יהושע
said to them, “Neither do I say to you by what authority I do these.” 
Luk
20:9  And He began to speak this parable
to the people, “A certain man planted a vineyard, and leased it to farmers, and
went away for a long time. 
Luk
20:10  “And at harvest time he sent a servant to the farmers, to give him some of
the fruit of the vineyard. But the farmers beat him and sent him away
empty-handed. 
Luk
20:11  “And again he sent another
servant. And they beat him too and maltreated him, and sent him away
empty-handed. 
Luk
20:12  “And again he sent a third. And
they wounded him too and cast him out. 
Luk
20:13  “And the owner of the vineyard
said, ‘What shall I do? I shall send my son, the beloved. They might respect
him when they see him.’ 
Luk
20:14  “But when the farmers saw him,
they reasoned among themselves, saying, ‘This is the heir. Come, let us kill
him, so that the inheritance becomes ours.’ 
Luk
20:15  “And they cast him out of the
vineyard and killed him. What, then, shall the owner of the vineyard do to
them? 
Luk
20:16  “He shall come and destroy those
farmers and give the vineyard to others.” And having heard, they said, “Let it
not be!” 
Luk
20:17  But He looked at them and said, “What
then is this that has been written, ‘The stone which the builders rejected has
become the chief corner-stone’? 
Luk
20:18  “Everyone who falls on that stone
shall be broken, but on whomever it falls, he shall be pulverised.” 
Luk
20:19  And the chief priests and the
scribes sought to lay hands on Him in the same hour, but they feared the
people, for they knew that He had spoken this parable against them. 
Luk
20:20  And keeping a close watch on Him, they sent spies who pretended to
be righteous, to catch Him in a word, in order to deliver Him to the rule and
to the authority of the governor. 
Luk
20:21  So they asked Him, saying, “Teacher,
we know that You say and teach rightly, and You are not partial to any, but
teach the way of Elohim truly, 
Luk
20:22  “Is it right for us to pay taxes
to Caesar or not?” 
Luk
20:23  But perceiving their craftiness,
He said to them, “Why do you try Me? 
Luk
20:24  “Show Me a silver piece. Whose
likeness and inscription does it have?” And they answering, said, “Caesar’s.” 
Luk
20:25  And He said to them, “Then give to
Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to Elohim what is Elohim’s.” 
Luk
20:26  And they were unable to catch Him
in a saying in the presence of the people, and marvelling at His answer, they
were silent. 
Luk
20:27  And some of the Sadducees, who
deny that there is a resurrection, came to Him and asked Him, 
Luk
20:28  saying, “Teacher, Mosheh wrote to
us that if a man’s brother dies, having a wife, and he dies childless, his
brother should take his wife and raise up offspring for his brother. 
Luk
20:29  “Now, there were seven brothers,
and the first took a wife, and died childless. 
Luk
20:30  “And the second took her as wife,
and he died childless. 
Luk
20:31  “And the third took her, and in
the same way the seven also. And they left no children, and died. 
Luk
20:32  “And last of all the woman died
too. 
Luk
20:33  “At the resurrection, then, whose
wife does she become? For the seven had her as wife.” 
Luk
20:34  And יהושע
answering, said to them, “The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage,

Luk
20:35  but those who are counted worthy
of attaining that age, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor
are they given in marriage, 
Luk
20:36  for neither is it possible for
them to die any more, because they are like messengers and are sons of Elohim,
being sons of the resurrection. 
Luk
20:37  “But that the dead are raised,
even Mosheh showed at the bush when he called יהוה ‘the
Elohim of Aḇraham, and the Elohim of Yitsḥaq, and the Elohim of Ya‛aqoḇ.’

Luk
20:38  “Now He is not the Elohim of the
dead, but of the living, for all live to Him.” 
Luk
20:39  And some of the scribes answering,
said, “Teacher, You have spoken well.” 
Luk
20:40  And they were not bold enough to question Him any more. 
Luk
20:41  And He said to them, “How do they
say that the Messiah is the Son of Dawiḏ? 
Luk
20:42  “For Dawiḏ himself said in
the Book of Psalms, ‘ יהוה said to my Master, “sit at
My right hand, 
Luk
20:43  until I make Your enemies a
footstool of Your feet.” ’ 
Luk
20:44  “Dawiḏ then calls Him ‘Master,’
how is He then his Son?” 
Luk
20:45  And in the hearing of all the
people, He said to His taught ones, 
Luk
20:46  “Beware of the scribes, who like
to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the market-places, and the best
seats in the congregations, and the best places at feasts, 
Luk
20:47  who devour widows’ houses, and for
a show make long prayers. They shall receive greater judgment.” 
Luk
21:1  And looking up He saw the rich
putting their gifts into the treasury, 
Luk
21:2  and He saw a certain poor widow
putting in two mites. 
Luk
21:3  And He said, “Truly I say to you
that this poor widow has put in more than all. 
Luk
21:4  “For all these out of their excess
have put in offerings for Elohim, but she out of her poverty has put in all
that she had to live on.” 
Luk
21:5  And as some were speaking about the
Set-apart Place, that it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts, He said, 
Luk
21:6  “These that you see – the days are
coming in which not one stone shall be left upon another that shall not be
thrown down.” 
Luk
21:7  And they asked Him, saying, “Teacher,
but when shall this be? And what is the sign when this is about to take place?”

Luk
21:8  And He said, “See that you are not
led astray, for many shall come in My Name, saying, ‘I am,’ and, ‘The time is
near.’ Then do not go after them. 
Luk
21:9  “But when you hear of fightings and
unrests, do not be alarmed, for these have to take place first, but the end is
not immediately.” 
Luk
21:10  Then He said to them, “Nation
shall rise against nation, and reign against reign. 
Luk
21:11  “And there shall be great
earthquakes in various places, and scarcities of food and deadly diseases. And
there shall be horrors, and great signs from heaven. 
Luk
21:12  “But before all this, they shall
lay their hands on you and persecute you, delivering you up to the
congregations and prisons, and be brought before sovereigns and rulers for My
Name’s sake. 
Luk
21:13  “And it shall turn out to you for
a witness. 
Luk
21:14  “Therefore, resolve in your hearts
not to premeditate on what to answer. 
Luk
21:15  “For I shall give you a mouth and
wisdom which all your adversaries shall not be able to refute or resist. 
Luk
21:16  “And you shall also be betrayed by
parents and brothers and relatives and friends. And some of you shall be put to
death. 
Luk
21:17  “And you shall be hated by all
because of My Name. 
Luk
21:18  “But not a hair of your head shall
be lost at all. 
Luk
21:19  “Possess your lives by your
endurance!
Luk
21:20  “And when you see Yerushalayim
surrounded by armies, then know that its laying waste is near. 
Luk
21:21  “Then let those in Yehuḏah
flee to the mountains, and let those who are in the midst of her go out, and
let not those who are in the fields enter her. 
Luk
21:22  “Because these are days of
vengeance, to fill all that have been written. 
Luk
21:23  “And woe to those who are pregnant
and to those who are nursing children in those days! For there shall be great
distress in the earth and wrath upon this people. 
Luk
21:24  “And they shall fall by the edge
of the sword, and be led away captive into all nations. And Yerushalayim shall
be trampled underfoot by the gentiles until the times of the gentiles are
filled. 
Luk
21:25  “And there shall be signs in the
sun, and moon, and stars, and on the earth anxiety of nations, in bewilderment
at the roaring of the sea, and agitation, 
Luk
21:26  men fainting from fear and the
expectation of what is coming on the earth, for the powers of the heavens shall
be shaken. 
Luk
21:27  “And then they shall see the Son
of Aḏam coming in a cloud with power and much esteem. 
Luk
21:28  “And when these matters begin to take place, look up and
lift up your heads, because your redemption draws near.” 
Luk
21:29  And He spoke a parable to them, “Look
at the fig tree, and all the trees. 
Luk
21:30  “When they have already budded,
observing it, you shall know for yourselves that summer is now near. 
Luk
21:31  “So you also, when you see these matters take place, know that the reign
of Elohim is near. 
Luk
21:32  “Truly, I say to you, this
generation shall by no means pass away till all shall have taken place. 
Luk
21:33  “The heaven and the earth shall
pass away, but My words shall by no means pass away. 
Luk
21:34  “And take heed to yourselves, lest
your hearts be weighed down by gluttony, and drunkenness, and worries of this
life, and that day come on you suddenly. 
Luk
21:35  “For it shall come as a snare on
all those dwelling on the face of all the earth. 
Luk
21:36  “Watch then at all times, and pray
that you be counted worthy to escape all this about to take place, and to stand
before the Son of Aḏam.” 
Luk
21:37  And He was teaching in the
Set-apart Place by day, but at night He went out and stayed on the mountain of
Olives, 
Luk
21:38  and early in the morning all the
people came to Him in the Set-apart Place to hear Him. 
Luk
22:1  And the Festival of Unleavened
Bread drew near, which is called Passover. 
Luk
22:2  And the chief priests and the
scribes were seeking how to kill Him, for they feared the people. 
Luk
22:3  And Satan entered into Yehuḏah,
who was called man from Qerioth, who
was numbered among the twelve. 
Luk
22:4  And he went and spoke with the
chief priests and captains, how he might deliver Him up to them. 
Luk
22:5  And they were glad, and agreed to
give him silver. 
Luk
22:6  And he promised, and was seeking an
occasion to deliver Him up to them, away from the crowd. 
Luk
22:7  And the Day of Unleavened Bread
came when the Passover had to be slaughtered. 
Luk
22:8  And He sent Kĕpha and
Yoḥanan, saying, “Go and prepare the Passover for us to eat.” 
Luk
22:9  And they said to Him, “Where do You
wish us to prepare?” 
Luk
22:10  And He said to them, “See, as you
enter into the city, a man shall meet you carrying a jar of water. Follow him
into the house he enters. 
Luk
22:11  “And you shall say to the master
of the house, ‘The Teacher says to you, “Where is the guest room where I might
eat the Passover with My taught ones?” ’ 
Luk
22:12  “And he shall show you a large,
furnished upper room. Prepare it there.” 
Luk
22:13  And going they found it as He had
said to them, and they prepared the Passover. 
Luk
22:14  And when the hour had come, He sat
down, and the twelve emissaries with Him. 
Luk
22:15  And He said to them, “With desire
I have desired to eat this Passover with you before My suffering, 
Luk
22:16  for I say to you, I shall
certainly not eat of it again until it is filled in the reign of Elohim.” 
Luk
22:17  And taking the cup, giving thanks,
He said, “Take this and divide it among yourselves, 
Luk
22:18  for I say to you, I shall
certainly not drink of the fruit of the vine until the reign of Elohim comes.” 
Luk
22:19  And taking bread, giving thanks,
He broke it and gave it to them, saying, “This is My body which is given for
you, do this in remembrance of Me.” 
Luk
22:20  Likewise the cup also, after
supper, saying, “This cup is the renewed covenant in My blood which is shed for
you. 
Luk
22:21  “But see, the hand of him
delivering Me up is with Me on the table. 
Luk
22:22  “For indeed the Son of Aḏam
goes as it has been decreed, but woe to that man by whom He is delivered up!” 
Luk
22:23  And they began to ask among
themselves, which of them it could be who was about to do this. 
Luk
22:24  And there also took place a
dispute among them, as to which of them seemed to be greater. 
Luk
22:25  And He said to them, “The
sovereigns of the gentiles rule over them, and those who control them are
called ‘workers of good.’ 
Luk
22:26  “But not so with you, but let him
who is greatest among you be as the youngest, and the leader as one who serves.

Luk
22:27  “For who is greater, the one who
sits at the table, or the one who serves? Is it not the one who sits at the
table? But I am in your midst as the One who serves. 
Luk
22:28  “But you are those who have
remained with Me in My trials. 
Luk
22:29  “And I covenant for you, as My
Father covenanted for Me, a reign, 
Luk
22:30  to eat and drink at My table, in
My reign, and to sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Yisra’ĕl.” 
Luk
22:31  And the Master said, “Shim‛on,
Shim‛on! See, Satan has asked for you to sift you as wheat. 
Luk
22:32  “But I have prayed for you, that
your belief should not fail. And when you have turned, strengthen your
brothers.” 
Luk
22:33  And he said to Him, “Master, I am
prepared to go with You, both to prison and to death.” 
Luk
22:34  And He said, “I say to you, Kĕpha,
the cock shall not crow at all today until you have denied three times that you
know Me.” 
Luk
22:35  And He said to them, “When I sent
you without purse and bag and sandals, did you lack any?” And they said, “None
at all.” 
Luk
22:36  And He said to them, “But now, let
him who has a purse take it, likewise also a bag. And let him who has no sword
sell his garment and buy one. 
Luk
22:37  “For I say to you that what has
been written has yet to be accomplished in Me, ‘And He was reckoned with
lawless ones.’ For that which refers to Me has an end too.” 
Luk
22:38  And they said, “Master, look, here
are two swords.” But He said to them, “That is enough!” 
Luk
22:39  And coming out, He went to the
Mount of Olives, according to usage, and His taught ones also followed Him. 
Luk
22:40  And coming to the place, He said
to them, “Pray that you do not enter into trial.” 
Luk
22:41  And He withdrew from them about a
stone’s throw, and falling on His knees He was praying, 
Luk
22:42  saying, “Father, if it be Your
counsel, remove this cup from Me. Yet not My desire, but let Yours be done.” 
Luk
22:43  And there appeared a messenger
from heaven to Him, strengthening Him. 
Luk
22:44  And being in agony, He was praying
more earnestly. And His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down to
the ground. 
Luk
22:45  And rising up from prayer, and
coming to His taught ones, He found them sleeping from grief. 
Luk
22:46  And He said to them, “Why do you
sleep? Rise and pray, lest you enter into trial.” 
Luk
22:47  And while He was still speaking,
see: a crowd! And he who was called Yehuḏah, one of the twelve, was going
before them and came near to יהושע to kiss Him. 
Luk
22:48  And יהושע
said to him, “Yehuḏah, do you deliver up the Son of Aḏam with a
kiss?” 
Luk
22:49  And those around Him, seeing what
was about to take place, said to Him, “Master, shall we strike with the sword?”

Luk
22:50  And one of them struck the servant
of the high priest and cut off his right ear. 
Luk
22:51  But יהושע
answering, said, “Allow it this far.” And touching his ear He healed him. 
Luk
22:52  And יהושע
said to those who had come against Him, the chief priests and captains of the
Set-apart Place and the elders, “Have you come out as against a robber, with
swords and clubs? 
Luk
22:53  “While I was with you daily in the
Set-apart Place, you did not lay hands on Me. But this is your hour and the
authority of darkness.” 
Luk
22:54  And having seized Him, they led
Him and brought Him to the house of the high priest. And Kĕpha was
following at a distance. 
Luk
22:55  And when they had lit a fire in
the midst of the courtyard, and sat down together, Kĕpha sat among them. 
Luk
22:56  And a certain servant girl, seeing
him as he sat by the fire, looked intently at him and said, “And this one was
with Him.” 
Luk
22:57  But he denied Him, saying, “Woman,
I do not know Him.” 
Luk
22:58  And after a little while another
saw him and said, “You are one of them too.” But Kĕpha said, “Man, I am
not!” 
Luk
22:59  And about an hour later, another
insisted, saying, “Truly, this one was with Him too, for he is a Galilean too.”

Luk
22:60  But Kĕpha said, “Man, I do
not know what you are saying!” And immediately, while he was still speaking, a
cock crowed. 
Luk
22:61  And the Master turned and looked
at Kĕpha, and Kĕpha remembered the word of the Master, how He had
said to him, “Before a cock crows, you shall deny Me three times.” 
Luk
22:62  And Kĕpha went out and wept
bitterly. 
Luk
22:63  And the men who were holding יהושע
were mocking Him, beating Him. 
Luk
22:64  And having blindfolded Him, they
were striking Him on the face and were asking Him, saying, “Prophesy! Who is it
that struck You?” 
Luk
22:65  And they said to Him much more,
blaspheming. 
Luk
22:66  And when it became day, the elders
of the people, both chief priests and scribes, came together and they led Him
into their council, saying, 
Luk
22:67  “If You are the Messiah, say it to
us.” And He said to them, “If I say to you, you would not believe it at all, 
Luk
22:68  and if I asked you, you would not
answer Me at all. 
Luk
22:69  “From now on the Son of Aḏam
shall sit on the right hand of the power of Elohim.” 
Luk
22:70  And they all said, “Are You then
the Son of Elohim?” And He said to them, “You say that I am.” 
Luk
22:71  And they said, “Why do we need
further witness? For we heard it ourselves from His mouth.” 
Luk
23:1  And the entire assembly of them,
having risen up, led Him to Pilate, 
Luk
23:2  and began to accuse Him, saying, “We
found this one perverting the nation, and forbidding to pay taxes to Caesar,
saying that He Himself is Messiah, a Sovereign.” 
Luk
23:3  And Pilate asked Him, saying, “Are
You the Sovereign of the Yehuḏim?” And answering him He said, “You say
it.” 
Luk
23:4  And Pilate said to the chief
priests and the crowd, “I find no guilt in this Man.” 
Luk
23:5  But they were insisting, saying, “He
stirs up the people, teaching through all Yehuḏah, beginning from Galil
unto this place.” 
Luk
23:6  And when Pilate heard of Galil, he
asked if the Man were a Galilean. 
Luk
23:7  And when he learned that He was
under the authority of Herodes, he sent Him to Herodes, who was also in
Yerushalayim in those days. 
Luk
23:8  And seeing יהושע,
Herodes rejoiced greatly, for a long time he had wished to see Him, because he
had heard much about Him, and was anticipating to see some miracle done by Him,

Luk
23:9  and was questioning Him with many
words, but He gave him no answer. 
Luk
23:10  And the chief priests and the
scribes stood, accusing Him intensely. 
Luk
23:11  And Herodes, with his soldiers,
made light of Him and mocked Him, dressing Him in a splendid robe, and sent Him
back to Pilate. 
Luk
23:12  And on that day Pilate and Herodes
became friends with each other, for before that they had been at enmity with
each other. 
Luk
23:13  And Pilate, having called together
the chief priests and the rulers and the people, 
Luk
23:14  said to them, “You brought this
Man to me, as one who turns away the people. And look, I have examined Him in
your presence and have found no guilt in this Man regarding the charges which
you make against Him, 
Luk
23:15  and neither did Herodes, for I
sent you back to him. And look, He has done none at all deserving death. 
Luk
23:16  “Having disciplined Him, then, I
shall release Him” – 
Luk
23:17  for he had to release one to them
at the festival. 
Luk
23:18  And they cried out, all together,
saying, “Away with this One, and release to us Barabba” 
Luk
23:19  (who had been thrown into prison
for a certain uprising made in the city, and for murder). 
Luk
23:20  Wishing to release יהושע,
then, Pilate appealed to them again. 
Luk
23:21  But they were calling out, saying,
“Impale! Impale Him!” 
Luk
23:22  And he said to them the third
time, “Why, what evil has He done? I have found no reason for death in Him.
Having disciplined Him then, I shall release Him.” 
Luk
23:23  But with loud voices they
insisted, asking for Him to be impaled. And the voices of these men and of the chief
priests were prevailing. 
Luk
23:24  And Pilate pronounced sentence
that what they asked should be done. 
Luk
23:25  And he released the one they asked
for, who for uprising and murder had been thrown into prison, but he handed יהושע
over to their wishes. 
Luk
23:26  And as they led Him away, they
laid hold of a certain man, Shim‛on a Cyrenian, who was coming from the
field, and they put the stake on him, to bear it behind יהושע.

Luk
23:27  And a great number of the people
were following Him, and women who also were mourning and lamenting Him. 
Luk
23:28  But יהושע,
turning to them, said, “Daughters of Yerushalayim, do not weep for Me, but weep
for yourselves and for your children. 
Luk
23:29  “For look, days are coming in
which they shall say, ‘Blessed are the barren, and wombs that never bore, and
the breasts which never nursed!’ 
Luk
23:30  “Then they shall begin ‘to say to
the mountains, “Fall on us!” and to the hills, “Cover us!” ’ 
Luk
23:31  “Because if they do this to the
green tree, what is going to be done to the dry tree?” 
Luk
23:32  And two others also, evil-doers,
were led with Him to be put to death. 
Luk
23:33  And when they had come to the
place called Golgotha, they impaled Him there, and the evil-doers, one on the
right and the other on the left. 
Luk
23:34  And יהושע
said, “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they do.” And they
divided His garments and cast lots. 
Luk
23:35  And the people were standing,
looking on, and the rulers also were sneering with them, saying, “He saved
others, let Him save Himself if He is the Messiah, the chosen of Elohim.” 
Luk
23:36  And the soldiers were mocking Him
too, coming and offering Him sour wine, 
Luk
23:37  and saying, “If You are the
Sovereign of the Yehuḏim, save Yourself.” 
Luk
23:38  And there was also an inscription
written over Him in letters of Greek, and Roman, and Heḇrew: THIS IS THE
SOVEREIGN OF THE YEHUḎIM.
Luk
23:39  And one of the evil-doers who were
hanged, was speaking evil of Him, saying, “If You are the Messiah, save Yourself
and us.” 
Luk
23:40  But the other, responding, rebuked
him, saying, “Do you not even fear Elohim, since you are under the same
judgment? 
Luk
23:41  “And we, indeed, rightly so, for
we receive the due reward of our deeds, but this One has done no wrong.” 
Luk
23:42  And he said to יהושע,
“Master, remember me when You come into Your reign.” 
Luk
23:43  And יהושע
said to him, “Truly, I say to you today, you shall be with Me in Paradise.” 
Luk
23:44  And it was now about the sixth
hour, and darkness came over all the land, until the ninth hour. 
Luk
23:45  And the sun was darkened, and the
veil of the Dwelling Place was torn in two. 
Luk
23:46  And crying out with a loud voice, יהושע
said, “Father, into Your hands I commit My spirit.” And having said this, He
breathed His last. 
Luk
23:47  And the captain, seeing what took
place, praised Elohim, saying, “Truly, this Man was righteous!” 
Luk
23:48  And when all the crowds who had
gathered to that sight saw what took place, they beat their breasts and went
away. 
Luk
23:49  And all those who knew Him, and
the women who followed Him from Galil, stood at a distance, watching this. 
Luk
23:50  And see, a man named Yosĕph,
a council member, a good and righteous man – 
Luk
23:51  he was not agreeing with their
counsel and deed – from Ramathayim, a city of the Yehuḏim, who himself
was also waiting for the reign of Elohim, 
Luk
23:52  he, going to Pilate, asked for the
body of יהושע. 
Luk
23:53  And taking it down, he wrapped it
in linen, and laid it in a tomb hewn out of the rock, where no one was yet
laid. 
Luk
23:54  And it was Preparation day, and
the Sabbath was approaching. 
Luk
23:55  And the women who had come with
Him from Galil followed after, and saw the tomb and how His body was laid. 
Luk
23:56  And having returned, they prepared
spices and perfumes. And they rested on the Sabbath according to the command. 
Luk
24:1  And on the first day of the week,
at early dawn, they came to the tomb, bringing the spices which they had
prepared, 
Luk
24:2  and they found the stone rolled
away from the tomb. 
Luk
24:3  And having entered, they did not
find the body of the Master יהושע. 
Luk
24:4  And it came to be, as they were
perplexed about this, that see, two men stood by them in glittering garments. 
Luk
24:5  And becoming frightened and bowing
their faces to the earth, these said to them, “Why do you seek the living among
the dead? 
Luk
24:6  “He is not here, but has been
raised up! Remember how He spoke to you when He was still in Galil, 
Luk
24:7  saying, ‘The Son of Aḏam has
to be delivered into the hands of sinners, and be impaled, and the third day
rise again.’ ” 
Luk
24:8  And they remembered His words. 
Luk
24:9  And having returned from the tomb
they reported all this to the eleven and to all the rest. 
Luk
24:10  And it was Miryam from Maḡdala,
and Yoḥanah, and Miryam the mother
of Ya‛aqoḇ, and the rest with them, who told this to the
emissaries. 
Luk
24:11  And their words appeared to them
to be nonsense, and they did not believe them. 
Luk
24:12  But Kĕpha arose and ran to
the tomb. And stooping down, he saw the linen wrappings lying by themselves.
And he went away home, marvelling at what took place. 
Luk
24:13  And see, two of them were going
that same day to a village called Amma’us, which was twelve kilometres from
Yerushalayim. 
Luk
24:14  And they were talking to each
other of all this which had taken place. 
Luk
24:15  And it came to be, as they were
talking and reasoning, that יהושע Himself drew
near and went with them. 
Luk
24:16  But their eyes were restrained, so
that they did not know Him. 
Luk
24:17  And He said to them, “What are
these words you are exchanging with each other as you are walking – and you are
sad?” 
Luk
24:18  And the one whose name was
Qleophas answering, said to Him, “Are You the lone visitor in Yerushalayim who
does not know what took place in it these days?” 
Luk
24:19  And He said to them, “What?” And
they said to Him, “Concerning יהושע of Natsareth,
who was a Prophet mighty in deed and word before Elohim and all the people, 
Luk
24:20  and how the chief priests and our
rulers delivered Him to be condemned to death, and impaled Him. 
Luk
24:21  “We, however, were expecting that
it was He who was going to redeem Yisra’ĕl. But besides all this, today is
the third day since these matters
took place. 
Luk
24:22  “But certain women of ours, who
arrived at the tomb early, also astonished us, 
Luk
24:23  when they did not find His body,
they came saying that they had also seen a vision of messengers who said He was
alive. 
Luk
24:24  “And some of those with us went to
the tomb and found it, as also the women had said, but they did not see Him.” 
Luk
24:25  And He said to them, “O
thoughtless ones, and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have
spoken! 
Luk
24:26  “Was it not necessary for the
Messiah to suffer these and to enter into His esteem?” 
Luk
24:27  And beginning at Mosheh and all
the Prophets, He was explaining to them in all the Scriptures the matters concerning Himself. 
Luk
24:28  And they approached the village
where they were going, and He seemed to be going on. 
Luk
24:29  But they urged Him strongly,
saying, “Stay with us, for it is toward evening, and the day has declined.” And
He went in to stay with them. 
Luk
24:30  And it came to be, when He sat at
the table with them, having taken the bread, He blessed, and having broken, He
was giving it to them. 
Luk
24:31  And their eyes were opened and
they recognised Him. And He disappeared from their sight. 
Luk
24:32  And they said to each other, “Was
not our heart burning within us as He was speaking to us on the way, and as He
was opening the Scriptures to us?” 
Luk
24:33  And rising up that same hour they
returned to Yerushalayim, and found the eleven and those who were with them
gathered together, 
Luk
24:34  saying, “The Master was truly
raised, and has appeared to Shim‛on!” 
Luk
24:35  And they related what took place on the way, and how He was
recognised by them in the breaking of the bread. 
Luk
24:36  And as they were saying this, יהושע
Himself stood in the midst of them, and said to them, “Peace to you.” 
Luk
24:37  And being startled and frightened,
they thought they had seen a spirit. 
Luk
24:38  And He said to them, “Why are you
troubled? And why do doubts arise in your hearts? 
Luk
24:39  “See My hands and My feet, that it
is I Myself. Handle Me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as
you see I have.” 
Luk
24:40  And saying this, He showed them
His hands and His feet. 
Luk
24:41  And while they were still not
believing for joy, and marvelling, He said to them, “Have you any food here?” 
Luk
24:42  And they gave Him a piece of a
broiled fish and some honeycomb. 
Luk
24:43  And taking it He ate in their presence.

Luk
24:44  And He said to them, “These are
the words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all have to be
filled that were written in the Torah of Mosheh and the Prophets and the Psalms
concerning Me.” 
Luk
24:45  Then He opened their minds to
understand the Scriptures, 
Luk
24:46  and said to them, “Thus it has
been written, and so it was necessary for the Messiah to suffer and to rise
again from the dead the third day, 
Luk
24:47  and that repentance and
forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in His Name to all nations, beginning
at Yerushalayim. 
Luk
24:48  “And you are witnesses of these matters. 
Luk
24:49  “And see, I am sending the Promise
of My Father upon you, but you are to remain in the city of Yerushalayim until
you are clothed with power from on high.” 
Luk
24:50  And He led them out as far as Bĕyth
Anyah, and lifting up His hands He blessed them. 
Luk
24:51  And it came to be, while He was
blessing them, that He was parted from them and was taken up into the heaven. 
Luk
24:52  And they, having bowed down to
Him, returned to Yerushalayim with great joy,
