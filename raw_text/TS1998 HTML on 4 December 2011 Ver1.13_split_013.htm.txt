Shophetim/Judges
Judges
1:1  And it came to be, after the death
of Yehoshua, that the children of Yisra’ĕl asked יהוה,
saying, “Who of us should go up first against the Kena‛anites to fight
against them?” 
Judges
1:2  And יהוה
said, “Yehuḏah does go up. See, I have given the land into his hand.” 
Judges
1:3  And Yehuḏah said to Shim‛on
his brother, “Come up with me into my allotment, and let us fight against the
Kena‛anites. And I myself shall also go with you into your allotment.” So
Shim‛on went with him. 
Judges
1:4  And Yehuḏah went up, and יהוה
gave the Kena‛anites and the Perizzites into their hand. And they smote
ten thousand men at Bezeq. 
Judges
1:5  And they found Aḏoni-Ḇezeq
in Bezeq, and fought against him, and smote the Kena‛anites and the
Perizzites. 
Judges
1:6  But Aḏoni-Ḇezeq fled,
and they pursued him and caught him and cut off his thumbs and big toes. 
Judges
1:7  And Aḏoni-Ḇezeq said, “Seventy
sovereigns with their thumbs and big toes cut off used to gather food under my table. As I have done, so
Elohim has repaid me.” And they brought him to Yerushalayim, and he died there.

Judges
1:8  And the children of Yehuḏah
fought against Yerushalayim and captured it, and smote it with the edge of the
sword and set the city on fire. 
Judges
1:9  And afterward the children of Yehuḏah
went down to fight against the Kena‛anites who dwelt in the mountains, in
the South, and in the low country. 
Judges
1:10  And Yehuḏah went against the
Kena‛anites who dwelt in Ḥeḇron – now the name of Ḥeḇron
was formerly Qiryath Arba – and they smote Shĕshai, and Aḥiman, and
Talmai. 
Judges
1:11  And from there they went against
the inhabitants of Deḇir – now the name of Deḇir was formerly
Qiryath Sĕpher. 
Judges
1:12  And Kalĕḇ said, “He who
smites Qiryath Sĕpher, and shall capture it, to him I shall give my
daughter Aḵsah as wife.” 
Judges
1:13  And Othni’ĕl son of Qenaz, Kalĕḇ’s
younger brother, captured it. And he gave him his daughter Aḵsah as wife.

Judges
1:14  And it came to be, when she came
in, that she urged him to ask her father for a field. And when she got off from
her donkey, Kalĕḇ said to her, “What is the matter?” 
Judges
1:15  And she said to him, “Give me a
blessing. Since you have given me land in the South, give me also springs of
water.” So Kalĕḇ gave her the upper springs and the lower springs. 
Judges
1:16  And the children of the Qĕynite,
father-in-law of Mosheh, went up from the city of palms with the children of
Yehuḏah into the Wilderness of Yehuḏah, which is in the Neḡeḇ
of Araḏ. And they went and dwelt among the people. 
Judges
1:17  And Yehuḏah went with Shim‛on
his brother, and they smote the Kena‛anites who inhabited Tsephath, and
put it under the ban. So the name of the city was called Ḥormah. 
Judges
1:18  And Yehuḏah captured Azzah
and its border, and Ashqelon and its border, and Eqron and its border. 
Judges
1:19  And יהוה
was with Yehuḏah, so they took possession of the mountains, but they were
unable to drive out the inhabitants of the plain, because they had chariots of
iron. 
Judges
1:20  And they gave Ḥeḇron to
Kalĕḇ, as Mosheh had said, and he drove out from there the three
sons of Anaq. 
Judges
1:21  However, the children of Binyamin
did not drive out the Yeḇusites who inhabited Yerushalayim, so the Yeḇusites
have dwelt with the children of Binyamin in Yerushalayim to this day. 
Judges
1:22  And the house of Yosĕph also
went up against Bĕyth Ĕl, and יהוה was with
them. 
Judges
1:23  And the house of Yosĕph sent
men to spy out Bĕyth Ĕl – now the name of the city was formerly Luz. 
Judges
1:24  And the watchmen saw a man coming
out of the city, and they said to him, “Please show us the entrance to the
city, and we shall show you kindness.” 
Judges
1:25  So he showed them the entrance to
the city, and they smote the city with the edge of the sword. But the man and
all his clan they let go, 
Judges
1:26  and the man went to the land of the
Ḥittites and built a city, and called its name Luz, which is its name to
this day. 
Judges
1:27  And Menashsheh did not dispossess Bĕyth
She’an and its villages, nor Ta‛anaḵ and its villages, nor the
inhabitants of Dor and its villages, nor the inhabitants of Yiḇle‛am
and its villages, nor the inhabitants of Meḡiddo and its villages, for
the Kena‛anites desired to dwell in that land. 
Judges
1:28  And it came to be, when Yisra’ĕl
was strong, that they put the Kena‛anites into compulsory labour, but did
not completely drive them out. 
Judges
1:29  Neither did Ephrayim drive out the
Kena‛anites who dwelt in Gezer, so the Kena‛anites dwelt in their
midst, in Gezer. 
Judges
1:30  Neither did Zeḇulun drive out
the inhabitants of Qitron or the inhabitants of Nahalol, so the Kena‛anites
dwelt in their midst, and became compulsory labour. 
Judges
1:31  Neither did Ashĕr drive out
the inhabitants of Akko nor the inhabitants of Tsiḏon, nor of Aḥlaḇ,
nor of Aḵziḇ, nor of Ḥelbah, nor of Aphiq, nor of Reḥoḇ.

Judges
1:32  So the Ashĕrites dwelt in the
midst of the Kena‛anites, the inhabitants of the land, because they did
not drive them out. 
Judges
1:33  Neither did Naphtali drive out the
inhabitants of Bĕyth Shemesh nor the inhabitants of Bĕyth Anath, but
they dwelt among the Kena‛anites, the inhabitants of the land. And the
inhabitants of Bĕyth Shemesh and of Bĕyth Anath became compulsory
labour for them. 
Judges
1:34  And the Amorites pressed the
children of Dan into the mountains, for they would not allow them to come down
to the valley, 
Judges
1:35  and the Amorites desired to dwell
in Mount Ḥeres, in Ayalon, and in Sha‛alḇim. But when the
hand of the house of Yosĕph became stronger, they became compulsory
labour. 
Judges
1:36  And the border of the Amorites was
from the Ascent of Aqrabbim, from Sela, and upward. 
Judges
2:1  And the Messenger of יהוה
came up from Gilgal to Boḵim, and said, “I led you up from Mitsrayim and
brought you to the land of which I swore to your fathers, and I said, ‘I do not
break My covenant with you, 
Judges
2:2  and as for you, do not make a
covenant with the inhabitants of this land – break down their altars.’ But you
have not obeyed My voice. What is this you have done? 
Judges
2:3  “Therefore I also said, ‘I am not
driving them out before you, and they shall be adversaries to you, and their
mighty ones shall be a snare to you.’ ” 
Judges
2:4  And it came to be, when the
Messenger of יהוה spoke these words to all the children
of Yisra’ĕl, that the people lifted up their voice and wept. 
Judges
2:5  So they called the name of that
place Boḵim, and slaughtered there to יהוה. 
Judges
2:6  Then Yehoshua dismissed the people,
and the children of Yisra’ĕl went each to his own inheritance to possess
the land. 
Judges
2:7  And the people served יהוה
all the days of Yehoshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Yehoshua,
who had seen all the great works of יהוה which He had
done for Yisra’ĕl. 
Judges
2:8  And Yehoshua son of Nun, the servant
of יהוה, died, one hundred and ten years old. 
Judges
2:9  And they buried him within the
border of his inheritance at Timnath Ḥeres, in the mountains of Ephrayim,
on the north side of Mount Ga‛ash. 
Judges
2:10  And all that generation were
likewise gathered to their fathers, and another generation arose after them who
did not know יהוה nor the work which He had done for
Yisra’ĕl. 
Judges
2:11  Then the children of Yisra’ĕl
did evil in the eyes of יהוה, and served the Ba‛als,

Judges
2:12  and forsook יהוה
Elohim of their fathers, who had brought them out of the land of Mitsrayim, and
went after other mighty ones, of the mighty ones of the people who were all
around them, and they bowed down to them, and provoked יהוה.

Judges
2:13  So they forsook יהוה
and served Ba‛al and the Ashtoreths. 
Judges
2:14  And the displeasure of יהוה
burned against Yisra’ĕl. Therefore He gave them into the hands of
plunderers who despoiled them. And He sold them into the hands of their enemies
all around, and they were unable to stand before their enemies any longer. 
Judges
2:15  Wherever they went out, the hand of
יהוה was against them for evil, as יהוה
had spoken, and as יהוה had sworn to them. And they
were distressed – greatly. 
Judges
2:16  Then יהוה
raised up rulers who saved them from the hand of those who plundered them. 
Judges
2:17  However, they did not listen to
their rulers either, but went whoring after other mighty ones, and bowed down
to them. They soon turned aside from the way in which their fathers walked, in
obeying the commands of יהוה – they did not do so. 
Judges
2:18  And when יהוה
raised up rulers for them, יהוה was with the ruler and
saved them from the hand of their enemies all the days of the ruler, for יהוה
had compassion on their groaning because of those who oppressed them and
crushed them. 
Judges
2:19  And it came to be, when the ruler
was dead, that they would turn back and do more corruptly than their fathers,
to go after other mighty ones, to serve them and bow down to them. They did not
refrain from their practices and from their stubborn way. 
Judges
2:20  And the displeasure of יהוה
burned against Yisra’ĕl, and He said, “Because this nation has
transgressed My covenant that I commanded their fathers, and has not obeyed My
voice, 
Judges
2:21  I also shall no longer drive out
before them any of the nations which Yehoshua left when he died, 
Judges
2:22  in order to try Yisra’ĕl by
them, whether they would guard the way of יהוה, to walk
in them as their fathers guarded them, or not.”
Judges
2:23  So יהוה
left those nations, without driving them out at once, and did not give them
into the hand of Yehoshua. 
Judges
3:1  And these are the nations which יהוה
left, to try Yisra’ĕl by them, all those who had not known all the battles
in Kena‛an, 
Judges
3:2  only that the generations of the
children of Yisra’ĕl might know, to teach them battle, only those who
before did not know them: 
Judges
3:3  five princes of the Philistines, and
all the Kena‛anites, and the Tsiḏonians, and the Ḥiwwites who
dwelt in Mount Leḇanon, from Mount Ba‛al Ḥermon to the
entrance of Ḥamath. 
Judges
3:4  And they were to try Yisra’ĕl
by them, to know whether they would obey the commands of יהוה,
which He had commanded their fathers by the hand of Mosheh. 
Judges
3:5  Thus the children of Yisra’ĕl
dwelt in the midst of the Kena‛anites, the Ḥittites, and the
Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Ḥiwwites, and the Yeḇusites, 
Judges
3:6  and took their daughters to be their
wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and they served their mighty
ones. 
Judges
3:7  Thus the children of Yisra’ĕl
did evil in the eyes of יהוה, and forgot יהוה
their Elohim, and served the Ba‛als and the Ashĕrahs. 
Judges
3:8  And the displeasure of יהוה
burned against Yisra’ĕl, and He sold them into the hand of Kushan-Rish‛athayim
sovereign of Aram Naharayim. And the children of Yisra’ĕl served
Kushan-Rish‛athayim eight years. 
Judges
3:9  And when the children of Yisra’ĕl
cried out to יהוה, יהוה raised
up a saviour for the children of Yisra’ĕl, who saved them: Othni’ĕl
son of Qenaz, Kalĕḇ’s younger brother. 
Judges
3:10  And the Spirit of יהוה
came upon him, and he ruled Yisra’ĕl, and went out to battle, and יהוה
gave into his hand Kushan-Rish‛athayim sovereign of Aram Naharayim. And
his hand prevailed over Kushan-Rish‛athayim, 
Judges
3:11  and the land had rest for forty
years. Then Othni’ĕl son of Qenaz died, 
Judges
3:12  and the children of Yisra’ĕl
again did evil in the eyes of יהוה. And יהוה
made Eḡlon sovereign of Mo’aḇ strong against Yisra’ĕl, because
they had done evil in the eyes of יהוה. 
Judges
3:13  And he gathered to himself the
children of Ammon and Amalĕq, and went and smote Yisra’ĕl, and they
took possession of the city of palms. 
Judges
3:14  And the children of Yisra’ĕl
served Eḡlon sovereign of Mo’aḇ eighteen years. 
Judges
3:15  And when the children of Yisra’ĕl
cried out to יהוה, יהוה raised
up a saviour for them: Ĕhuḏ son of Gĕra, a Binyamite, a man
impeded in his right hand. And by him the children of Yisra’ĕl sent a
present to Eḡlon sovereign of Mo’aḇ. 
Judges
3:16  And Ĕhuḏ made himself a
sword, it was double-edged and a cubit in length, and he girded it under his
long robe on his right thigh. 
Judges
3:17  And he brought the present to Eḡlon
sovereign of Mo’aḇ. Now Eḡlon was a very fat man. 
Judges
3:18  And it came to be that when he had
finished bringing near the present, he sent away the people bearing the
present. 
Judges
3:19  But he himself turned back from the
stone images that were at Gilgal, and said, “I have a secret message for you, O
sovereign.” And he said, “Be silent!” And all those standing beside him went
out from him. 
Judges
3:20  And Ĕhuḏ came to him
while he was sitting in his cool roof room. And Ĕhuḏ said, “I have a
message from Elohim for you.” So he arose from his seat. 
Judges
3:21  And Ĕhuḏ reached with
his left hand, and took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his
stomach. 
Judges
3:22  And the handle went in after the
blade, and the fat closed over the blade, for he did not draw the sword out of
his stomach, and it came out behind. 
Judges
3:23  Then Ĕhuḏ went out to
the porch and shut the doors of the upper room behind him and locked them. 
Judges
3:24  And when he had gone out, his
servants came to look and saw the doors of the roof room were locked. So they
said, “He is only covering his feet in the cool roof room.” 
Judges
3:25  And they waited until they were
ashamed, but saw he was not opening the doors of the upper room. So they took
the key and opened them and saw their master, fallen to the ground, dead. 
Judges
3:26  But while they were delaying Ĕhuḏ
escaped and had passed beyond the stone images, and escaped to Se‛irah. 
Judges
3:27  And it came to be, when he arrived,
that he blew the ram’s horn in the mountains of Ephrayim, and the children of
Yisra’ĕl went down with him from the mountains, with him leading them. 
Judges
3:28  And he said to them, “Follow me,
for יהוה has given your enemies the Mo’aḇites
into your hand.” And they went down after him, and took the fords of Yardĕn
leading to Mo’aḇ, and did not allow anyone to pass over. 
Judges
3:29  And they smote about ten thousand
men of Mo’aḇ at that time, all robust and brave men, and not a man
escaped. 
Judges
3:30  And on that day Mo’aḇ was
humbled under the hand of Yisra’ĕl. And the land had rest for eighty
years. 
Judges
3:31  And after him was Shamgar son of
Anath, and he smote six hundred men of the Philistines with an ox goad. And he
too saved Yisra’ĕl. 
Judges
4:1  And when Ĕhuḏ was dead,
the children of Yisra’ĕl again did evil in the eyes of יהוה.

Judges
4:2  Therefore יהוה
sold them into the hand of Yaḇin the sovereign of Kena‛an, who
reigned in Ḥatsor. And the commander of his army was Sisera, who was
dwelling in Ḥarosheth Haggoyim. 
Judges
4:3  And the children of Yisra’ĕl
cried out to יהוה, because he had nine hundred chariots
of iron, and for twenty years he harshly oppressed the children of Yisra’ĕl.

Judges
4:4  And Deḇorah, a prophetess, the
wife of Lappiḏoth, was ruling Yisra’ĕl at that time. 
Judges
4:5  And she was dwelling under the palm
tree of Deḇorah between Ramah and Bĕyth Ĕl in the mountains of
Ephrayim. And the children of Yisra’ĕl came up to her for right-ruling. 
Judges
4:6  And she sent and called for Baraq
son of Aḇino‛am from Qeḏesh in Naphtali, and said to him, “Has
not יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl commanded, ‘Go, and
you shall draw towards Mount Taḇor, and shall take with you ten thousand
men of the sons of Naphtali and of the sons of Zeḇulun, 
Judges
4:7  and I shall draw unto you Sisera,
the commander of Yaḇin’s army, with his chariots and his company at the
wadi Qishon, and shall give him into your hand’?” 
Judges
4:8  And Baraq said to her, “If you go
with me, then I shall go; but if you do not go with me, I do not go.” 
Judges
4:9  And she said, “I shall certainly go
with you. Only, there shall be no esteem for you in the journey you are taking,
for יהוה is going to sell Sisera into the hand of a
woman.” So Deḇorah arose and went with Baraq to Qeḏesh. 
Judges
4:10  And Baraq called Zeḇulun and
Naphtali to Qeḏesh. And he went up – ten thousand men under his command –
and Deḇorah went up with him. 
Judges
4:11  And Ḥeḇer the Qĕynite,
of the children of Ḥoḇaḇ the father-in-law of Mosheh, had
separated himself from the Qĕynites and pitched his tent near the
terebinth tree at Tsa‛anayim, which is beside Qeḏesh. 
Judges
4:12  And they reported to Sisera that
Baraq son of Aḇino‛am had gone up to Mount Taḇor. 
Judges
4:13  So Sisera called all his chariots,
nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people who were with him, from Ḥarosheth
Haggoyim to the wadi Qishon. 
Judges
4:14  And Deḇorah said to Baraq, “Rise
up! For this is the day in which יהוה has given Sisera
into your hand. Has not יהוה gone out before you?” And
Baraq went down from Mount Taḇor with ten thousand men after him. 
Judges
4:15  And יהוה
destroyed Sisera and all his chariots and all his army with the edge of the
sword before Baraq. And Sisera leaped from his chariot and fled away on foot. 
Judges
4:16  But Baraq pursued the chariots and
the army as far as Ḥarosheth Haggoyim, and all the army of Sisera fell by
the edge of the sword, not one was left. 
Judges
4:17  Sisera, meanwhile, had fled on foot
to the tent of Ya‛ĕl, the wife of Ḥeḇer the Qĕynite,
for there was peace between Yaḇin sovereign of Ḥatsor and the house
of Ḥeḇer the Qĕynite. 
Judges
4:18  And Ya‛ĕl went out to
meet Sisera, and said to him, “Turn aside, my master, turn aside to me, do not
fear.” So he turned aside with her into the tent, and she covered him with a
blanket. 
Judges
4:19  And he said to her, “Please give me
a little water to drink, for I am thirsty.” So she opened a bottle of milk, and
gave him a drink, and covered him. 
Judges
4:20  And he said to her, “Stand at the
door of the tent, and it shall be if anyone comes and asks you, and says, ‘Is
there a man here?’ you shall say, ‘No.’ ” 
Judges
4:21  But Ya‛ĕl, Ḥeḇer’s
wife, took a tent peg and took a hammer in her hand, and went softly to him and
drove the peg into the side of his head, and it went down into the ground – for
he was fast asleep and exhausted – and he died.
Judges
4:22  And see, as Baraq pursued Sisera,
Ya‛ĕl came out to meet him, and said to him, “Come, let me show you
the man whom you are seeking.” And when he went into her tent, there lay
Sisera, dead with the peg in the side of his head. 
Judges
4:23  And on that day Elohim humbled Yaḇin
sovereign of Kena‛an in the presence of the children of Yisra’ĕl. 
Judges
4:24  And the hand of the children of
Yisra’ĕl grew stronger and stronger against Yaḇin sovereign of Kena‛an,
until they had cut off Yaḇin sovereign of Kena‛an. 
Judges
5:1  And on that day Deḇorah and
Baraq son of Aḇino‛am sang, saying, 
Judges
5:2  “For leaders leading in Yisra’ĕl,
for the people volunteering, bless יהוה ! 
Judges
5:3  “Hear, O sovereigns! Give ear, O
princes! I, I do sing to יהוה ; I sing praise to יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl. 
Judges
5:4  “ יהוה, when
You went out from Sĕ‛ir, when You stepped from the field of Eḏom,
the earth shook and the heavens poured, the clouds also poured water. 
Judges
5:5  “The mountains flowed at the
presence of יהוה, this Sinai, at the presence of יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl. 
Judges
5:6  “In the days of Shamgar, the son of
Anath, in the days of Ya‛ĕl, the highways were deserted, and the
travellers went in crooked ways. 
Judges
5:7  “Leadership ceased, it ceased in
Yisra’ĕl, until I, Deḇorah, arose – a mother in Yisra’ĕl arose.

Judges
5:8  “They chose new mighty ones, then
fighting was in the gates! Neither a shield nor spear was seen among forty
thousand in Yisra’ĕl. 
Judges
5:9  “My heart is towards the lawgivers
of Yisra’ĕl, the volunteers among the people. Bless יהוה
! 
Judges
5:10  “You who ride on white donkeys, you
who sit on rich carpets, and you who walk along the way, declare it! 
Judges
5:11  “By the voice of shouters, between
the places of drawing water, there they recount the righteous acts of יהוה,
the righteous acts of His leadership in Yisra’ĕl; then the people of יהוה
shall go down to the gates. 
Judges
5:12  “Wake up, wake up, Deḇorah!
Wake up, wake up, sing a song! Arise, Baraq, and lead your captives away, O son
of Aḇino‛am! 
Judges
5:13  “Then He set the remnant to rule
the nobles; יהוה came down for me against the mighty
ones. 
Judges
5:14  “Out of Ephrayim their root is
against Amalĕq. After you, Binyamin, with your peoples, out of Maḵir
lawgivers came down, and out of Zeḇulun those who handle the scribe’s
reed. 
Judges
5:15  “And the heads of Yissasḵar
were with Deḇorah. And as Yissasḵar, so was Baraq sent into the
valley under his command. Among the divisions of Re’uḇĕn there were
great searchings of heart. 
Judges
5:16  “Why did you remain among the
sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings of the flocks? The divisions of Re’uḇĕn
have great searchings of heart. 
Judges
5:17  “Gil‛aḏ remained beyond
the Yardĕn, and why did Dan remain on ships? Ashĕr continued at the
seashore, and remained by its landing places. 
Judges
5:18  “Zeḇulun is a people who
risked their lives to the point of death, Naphtali also, on the heights of the
field. 
Judges
5:19  “Sovereigns came, they fought, then
the sovereigns of Kena‛an fought in Ta‛anaḵ, by the waters of
Meḡiddo; they took no spoils of silver. 
Judges
5:20  “From the heavens they fought; the
stars from their courses fought against Sisera. 
Judges
5:21  “The wadi of Qishon swept them
away, that age-old wadi, the wadi of Qishon. O my being, you have trampled in
strength! 
Judges
5:22  “Then stamped hoofs of horses, with
the galloping, galloping of his steeds. 
Judges
5:23  ‘Curse Mĕroz,’ said a
messenger of יהוה, ‘curse, curse its inhabitants,
because they did not come to the help of יהוה, to the
help of יהוה among the mighty.’ 
Judges
5:24  “Blessed above women is Ya‛ĕl,
the wife of Ḥeḇer the Qĕynite – above women in tents she is
blessed. 
Judges
5:25  “He asked for water, she gave milk;
she brought out curdled milk in a bowl for nobles. 
Judges
5:26  “She stretched her hand to the tent
peg, and her right hand to the workmen’s hammer. Then she pounded Sisera, she
smashed his head, she pierced and struck through the side of his head. 
Judges
5:27  “Between her feet he bowed, he
fell, he lay still; between her feet he bowed, he fell; where he bowed, there
he fell – destroyed. 
Judges
5:28  “Through the window the mother of
Sisera looked, and cried out through the lattice, ‘Why does his chariot delay
to come? Why have the steps of his chariots tarried?’ 
Judges
5:29  “The wise ones of her princesses
answered her, indeed, she answered herself, 
Judges
5:30  ‘Do they not find and divide the
spoil: a girl or two for each man; a spoil of dyed work for Sisera, a spoil of
dyed work embroidered, dyed work richly embroidered for the necks of the
looter?’ 
Judges
5:31  “So do all Your enemies perish, O יהוה
! But let those who love Him be like the sun rising in its might!” And the land
had rest forty years.
Judges
6:1  And the children of Yisra’ĕl
did evil in the eyes of יהוה, and יהוה
gave them into the hand of Miḏyan for seven years, 
Judges
6:2  and the hand of Miḏyan was
strong against Yisra’ĕl. And before the faces of the Miḏyanites the
children of Yisra’ĕl made for themselves the refuges which are in the
mountains, and the caves, and the strongholds. 
Judges
6:3  And it came to be, whenever Yisra’ĕl
had sown, that Miḏyan would come up, and Amalĕq and the people of
the East would come up against them, 
Judges
6:4  and encamp against them and destroy
the increase of the soil as far as Azzah, and leave no food in Yisra’ĕl,
neither sheep nor ox nor donkey. 
Judges
6:5  For they came up with their
livestock and their tents, coming in as numerous as locusts. And they and their
camels were without number. And they came into the land to destroy it. 
Judges
6:6  Thus Yisra’ĕl was brought very
low because of Miḏyan, and the children of Yisra’ĕl cried out to יהוה.

Judges
6:7  And it came to be, when the children
of Yisra’ĕl cried out to יהוה because of Miḏyan,

Judges
6:8  that יהוה
sent a prophet to the children of Yisra’ĕl, who said to them, “Thus said יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, ‘I have brought you up from Mitsrayim and I brought
you out of the house of bondage, 
Judges
6:9  and I delivered you out of the hand
of the Mitsrites and out of the hand of all your oppressors, and drove them out
before you and gave you their land. 
Judges
6:10  ‘And I said to you, “I am יהוה
your Elohim, do not fear the mighty ones of the Amorites, in whose land you
dwell. And you have not obeyed My voice.” ’ ” 
Judges
6:11  And the Messenger of יהוה
came and sat under the terebinth tree which was in Ophrah, which belonged to Yo’ash
the Aḇi‛ezerite, while his son Giḏ‛on threshed wheat in
the winepress, to hide it from the eyes of the Miḏyanites. 
Judges
6:12  And the Messenger of יהוה
appeared to him, and said to him, “ יהוה is with you,
you mighty brave one!” 
Judges
6:13  And Giḏ‛on said to Him,
“O my master, if יהוה is with us, why has all this come
upon us? And where are all His wonders which our fathers related to us, saying,
‘Did not יהוה bring us up from Mitsrayim?’ But now יהוה
has left us and given us into the hands of Miḏyan.” 
Judges
6:14  And יהוה
turned to him and said, “Go in this strength of yours, and you shall save Yisra’ĕl
from the hand of the Miḏyanites. Have I not sent you?” 
Judges
6:15  And he said to Him, “O יהוה,
with what do I save Yisra’ĕl? See, my clan is the weakest in Menashsheh,
and I am the least in my father’s house.” 
Judges
6:16  And יהוה
said to him, “Because I am with you, you shall smite the Miḏyanites as
one man.” 
Judges
6:17  And he said to Him, “Please, if I
have found favour in Your eyes, then show me a sign that it is You who are
speaking with me. 
Judges
6:18  “Please do not move away from here,
until I come to You and bring out my offering and set it before You.” And He
said, “I shall stay until you return.” 
Judges
6:19  And Giḏ‛on went in, and
prepared a young goat, and unleavened bread from an ĕphah of flour. The
meat he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot. And he brought them out
to Him, under the terebinth tree, and presented it. 
Judges
6:20  And the Messenger of Elohim said to
him, “Take the meat and the unleavened bread and lay them on this rock, and
pour out the broth.” And he did so. 
Judges
6:21  And the Messenger of יהוה
put forth the end of the staff that was in His hand, and touched the meat and
the unleavened bread. And fire went up out of the rock and consumed the meat
and the unleavened bread. And the Messenger of יהוה
went from his sight. 
Judges
6:22  And when Giḏ‛on saw
that He was a Messenger of יהוה, Giḏ‛on
said, “Oh Master יהוה ! For I have seen a Messenger of יהוה
face to face.” 
Judges
6:23  And יהוה
said to him, “Peace be with you! Do not fear, you do not die.” 
Judges
6:24  And Giḏ‛on built an
altar there to יהוה, and called it: יהוה
Shalom. To this day it is still in Ophrah of the Aḇi‛ezerites. 
Judges
6:25  And the same night it came to be
that יהוה said to him, “Take the young bull of your
father, and the second bull of seven years old, and you shall throw down the
altar of Ba‛al that your father has, and cut down the Ashĕrah that
is beside it. 
Judges
6:26  “And you shall build an altar to יהוה
your Elohim on top of this rock in an orderly way, and shall take the second
bull and offer a burnt offering with the wood of the image which you cut down.”

Judges
6:27  And Giḏ‛on took ten men
from among his servants and did as יהוה had said to
him. And it came to be, because he feared his father’s household and the men of
the city too much to do it by day, that he did it by night. 
Judges
6:28  And the men of the city arose early
in the morning and saw the altar of Ba‛al was broken down, and the Ashĕrah
that was beside it had been cut down, and the second bull was being offered on
the altar which was built. 
Judges
6:29  And they said to each other, “Who
has done this deed?” And when they had inquired and asked, they said, “Giḏ‛on
son of Yo’ash has done this deed.” 
Judges
6:30  And the men of the city said to Yo’ash,
“Bring out your son, so that he dies, for he has broken down the altar of Ba‛al,
and because he has cut down the Ashĕrah that was beside it.” 
Judges
6:31  And Yo’ash said to all who stood
against him, “You, would you plead for Ba‛al? You, would you save him?
Let the one who would plead for him be put to death by morning! If he is a
mighty one, let him plead for himself, because his altar has been broken down!”

Judges
6:32  So that day he called him Yerubba‛al,
saying, “Let Ba‛al plead against him, because he has broken down his
altar.” 
Judges
6:33  Now all Miḏyan and Amalĕq
and the people of the East, were gathered together. And they passed over and
encamped in the Valley of Yizre‛ĕl. 
Judges
6:34  Then the Spirit of יהוה
came upon Giḏ‛on, and he blew the ram’s horn, and the Aḇi‛ezerites
gathered behind him. 
Judges
6:35  And he sent messengers throughout
all Menashsheh, who also gathered behind him. And he sent messengers to Ashĕr,
and to Zeḇulun, and to Naphtali. And they came up to meet them. 
Judges
6:36  And Giḏ‛on said to
Elohim, “If You are saving Yisra’ĕl by my hand as You have said, 
Judges
6:37  see, I am placing a fleece of wool
on the threshing-floor. If there is dew only on the fleece, and it is dry on
all the ground, then I shall know that You are saving Yisra’ĕl by my hand,
as You have said.” 
Judges
6:38  And it was so, and he rose early
the next morning and pressed the fleece, and wrung dew out of the fleece, to
fill a bowl with water. 
Judges
6:39  And Giḏ‛on said to
Elohim, “Do not be displeased with me, and let me speak only this time: Please
let me try only this time with the fleece, please let it be dry only on the
fleece, and let there be dew on all the ground.” 
Judges
6:40  And Elohim did so that night, and
it was dry on the fleece only, but there was dew on all the ground. 
Judges
7:1  And Yerubba‛al, that is Giḏ‛on,
and all the people who were with him rose up early and encamped by the fountain
of Ḥaroḏ, so that the camp of Miḏyan was on the north side of
them by the hill of Moreh in the valley. 
Judges
7:2  And יהוה
said to Giḏ‛on, “The people who are with you are too many for Me to
give Miḏyan into their hands, lest Yisra’ĕl boast against Me,
saying, ‘My own hand has saved me.’ 
Judges
7:3  “And now, proclaim in the hearing of
the people, saying, ‘Whoever is afraid and trembling, let him turn back, and
leave Mount Gil‛aḏ.’ ” And twenty-two thousand of the people turned
back, while ten thousand remained. 
Judges
7:4  And יהוה
said to Giḏ‛on, “The people are still too many. Bring them down to
the water, and let Me prove them for you there. And it shall be, that of whom I
say to you, ‘This one goes with you,’ let him go with you. And of whomever I
say to you, ‘This one does not go with you,’ let him not go.” 
Judges
7:5  So he brought the people down to the
water. And יהוה said to Giḏ‛on, “Everyone
who laps the water with his tongue, as a dog laps, separate him from everyone
who bows down on his knees to drink.” 
Judges
7:6  And the number of those who lapped,
putting their hand to their mouth, was three hundred men, and all the rest of
the people bowed down on their knees to drink water. 
Judges
7:7  And יהוה
said to Giḏ‛on, “By the three hundred men who lapped I save you,
and shall give Miḏyan into your hand. Let all the other people go, each
to his place.” 
Judges
7:8  And the people took food and their
ram’s horns in their hands. And he sent away all the rest of Yisra’ĕl, each to his tent, but kept those three
hundred men. Now the camp of Miḏyan was below him in the valley. 
Judges
7:9  And it came to be, on that night,
that יהוה said to him, “Arise, go down against the
camp, for I have given it into your hand. 
Judges
7:10  “But if you are afraid to go down,
go down, you and Purah your servant, to the camp. 
Judges
7:11  “And you shall hear what they say,
and after that let your hands be strengthened. And you shall go down against
the camp.” So he went down with Purah his servant to the edge of the formation of fives who were in the camp.

Judges
7:12  And Miḏyan and Amalĕq,
and all the people of the East, were lying in the valley as many as locusts.
And their camels were as numerous as the sand by the seashore. 
Judges
7:13  And Giḏ‛on came, and
see, a man was relating a dream to his companion, and said, “See I had a dream,
and see, a loaf of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Miḏyan, and it
came to a tent and smote it so that it fell and overturned, and the tent fell down.”

Judges
7:14  And his companion answered and
said, “This is nil else than the sword of Giḏ‛on son of Yo’ash, a
man of Yisra’ĕl. Elohim has given Miḏyan and all the camp into his
hand.” 
Judges
7:15  And it came to be, when Giḏ‛on
heard this dream related, and its interpretation, that he bowed himself down.
And he returned to the camp of Yisra’ĕl, and said, “Arise, for יהוה
has given the camp of Miḏyan into your hand.” 
Judges
7:16  And he divided the three hundred
men into three companies, and he put a ram’s horn into the hands of all of
them, with empty jars, and torches inside the jars. 
Judges
7:17  And he said to them, “Watch me and
do likewise. And see, when I come to the edge of the camp do as I do. 
Judges
7:18  “And I shall blow the ram’s horn, I
and all those with me, then you shall also blow the ram’s horns round about all
the camp, and say, ‘For יהוה and for Giḏ‛on!’
” 
Judges
7:19  And Giḏ‛on and the
hundred men who were with him came to the edge of the camp at the beginning of
the middle watch, as they had but newly posted the watch. And they blew the ram’s
horns and broke the jars that were in their hands. 
Judges
7:20  And the three companies blew the
ram’s horns and broke the jars, and held the torches in their left hands and
the ram’s horns in their right hands for blowing. And they cried, “For יהוה
and for Giḏ‛on!” 
Judges
7:21  And each stood in his place, round
about the camp. And all the army ran and cried out and fled, 
Judges
7:22  and the three hundred blew the ram’s
horns, and יהוה set the sword of each one against the
other throughout all the camp. And the army fled to Bĕyth Shittah, toward
Tserĕrah, as far as the border of Aḇĕl Meḥolah, by
Tabbath. 
Judges
7:23  And the men of Yisra’ĕl were
called from Naphtali, and from Ashĕr, and from all Menashsheh, and pursued
Miḏyan. 
Judges
7:24  Then Giḏ‛on sent
messengers throughout all the mountains of Ephrayim, saying, “Come down to meet
Miḏyan, and capture from them the watering places as far as Bĕyth
Barah and the Yardĕn.” So all the men of Ephrayim were called and captured
the watering places as far as Bĕyth Barah and the Yardĕn. 
Judges
7:25  And they captured two princes of Miḏyan,
Orĕḇ and Ze’ĕḇ, and slew Orĕḇ at the rock of
Orĕḇ, and Ze’ĕḇ they slew at the winepress of Ze’ĕḇ
while they pursued Miḏyan. And they brought the heads of Orĕḇ
and Ze’ĕḇ to Giḏ‛on beyond the Yardĕn. 
Judges
8:1  And the men of Ephrayim said to him,
“What is this you have done to us by not calling us when you went to fight with
Miḏyan?” And they contended with him sharply, 
Judges
8:2  and he said to them, “What have I
done as compared with you? Are the gleanings of Ephrayim not better than the
grape harvest of Aḇi‛ezer? 
Judges
8:3  “Elohim has given into your hands
the princes of Miḏyan, Orĕḇ and Ze’ĕḇ. And what was
I able to do as compared with you?” And when he had said that their rage toward
him subsided. 
Judges
8:4  And Giḏ‛on and the three
hundred men who were with him came to the Yardĕn, passing over, weary yet
pursuing. 
Judges
8:5  And he said to the men of Sukkoth, “Please
give loaves of bread to the people who follow me, for they are weary, and I am
pursuing Zeḇaḥ and Tsalmunna, sovereigns of Miḏyan.” 
Judges
8:6  But the leaders of Sukkoth said, “Are
the hands of Zeḇaḥ and Tsalmunna now in your hand, that we should
give bread to your army?” 
Judges
8:7  And Giḏ‛on said, “Because
of this, when יהוה has given Zeḇaḥ and
Tsalmunna into my hand, I shall tear your flesh with the thorns of the
wilderness and with briers!” 
Judges
8:8  And he went up from there to Penu’ĕl
and spoke to them in the same way. And the men of Penu’ĕl answered him as
the men of Sukkoth had answered him. 
Judges
8:9  So he spoke also to the men of Penu’ĕl,
saying, “When I come back in peace I shall break down this tower!” 
Judges
8:10  And Zeḇaḥ and Tsalmunna
were at Qarqor, and their armies with them, about fifteen thousand men, all who
were left of all the army of the people of the East. Now those who had already fallen were one hundred and
twenty thousand men who drew the sword. 
Judges
8:11  And Giḏ‛on went up by
the way of those who dwell in tents on the east of Noḇaḥ and Yoḡbehah.
And he smote the camp while the camp was at ease. 
Judges
8:12  And Zeḇaḥ and Tsalmunna
fled, and he pursued them, and captured the two sovereigns of Miḏyan, Zeḇaḥ
and Tsalmunna, and shuddered the entire army. 
Judges
8:13  And Giḏ‛on son of Yo’ash
returned from battle, from the Ascent of Ḥeres, 
Judges
8:14  and captured a youth of the men of
Sukkoth and questioned him. So the youth
wrote down for him the leaders of Sukkoth and its elders, seventy-seven men. 
Judges
8:15  And he came to the men of Sukkoth
and said, “See: Zeḇaḥ and Tsalmunna, about whom you taunted me,
saying, ‘Are the hands of Zeḇaḥ and Tsalmunna now in your hand,
that we should give bread to your men who are weary?’ ” 
Judges
8:16  And he took the elders of the city,
and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of
Sukkoth a lesson. 
Judges
8:17  And he broke down the tower of Penu’ĕl
and slew the men of the city. 
Judges
8:18  And he said to Zeḇaḥ
and Tsalmunna, “How were the men whom you killed at Taḇor?” So they
answered, “They were like you, each one looked like the son of a sovereign .”
Judges
8:19  And he said, “They were my
brothers, the sons of my mother. As יהוה lives, if you
had let them live, I would not slay you.” 
Judges
8:20  And he said to Yether his
first-born, “Rise, slay them!” But the youth would not draw his sword, for he
was afraid, because he was still a youth. 
Judges
8:21  Then Zeḇaḥ and
Tsalmunna said, “Rise yourself, and fall on us. For as a man is, so is his
might.” So Giḏ‛on arose and slew Zeḇaḥ and Tsalmunna,
and took the crescent ornaments which were on their camels’ necks. 
Judges
8:22  So the men of Yisra’ĕl said to
Giḏ‛on, “Rule over us, both you and your son, also your son’s son,
for you have saved us from the hand of Miḏyan.” 
Judges
8:23  But Giḏ‛on said to
them, “I do not rule over you, nor does my son rule over you. יהוה
does rule over you.” 
Judges
8:24  And Giḏ‛on said to
them, “I have a request to make of you, that each of you give me the ring from
his spoil.” For they had rings of gold, because they were Yishma‛ĕlites.

Judges
8:25  And they said, “We shall certainly
give them.” And they spread out a garment, and each man threw into it the ring
from his spoil. 
Judges
8:26  And the weight of the gold rings
that he requested was one thousand seven hundred pieces of gold – besides the
crescent ornaments, and the pendants, and purple robes which were on the sovereigns
of Miḏyan, and besides the chains that were around their camels’ necks. 
Judges
8:27  And Giḏ‛on made it into
a shoulder garment and set it up in his city, Ophrah. And all Yisra’ĕl
went whoring after it there. And it became a snare to Giḏ‛on and to
his house. 
Judges
8:28  Thus Miḏyan was humbled
before the children of Yisra’ĕl, and they lifted their heads no more. And
the land had rest for forty years in the days of Giḏ‛on. 
Judges
8:29  And Yerubba‛al son of Yo’ash
went and dwelt in his own house. 
Judges
8:30  And Giḏ‛on had seventy
sons who were his own offspring, for he had many wives. 
Judges
8:31  And his concubine who was in Sheḵem
also bore him a son, and he gave him the name Aḇimeleḵ. 
Judges
8:32  And Giḏ‛on son of Yo’ash
died at a good old age, and was buried in the tomb of Yo’ash his father, in
Ophrah of the Aḇi‛ezerites. 
Judges
8:33  And it came to be, when Giḏ‛on
was dead, that the children of Yisra’ĕl again went whoring after the Ba‛als,
and made Ba‛al-Berith their mighty one. 
Judges
8:34  Thus the children of Yisra’ĕl
did not remember יהוה their Elohim, who had delivered
them from the hands of all their enemies round about, 
Judges
8:35  nor did they show kindness to the
house of Yerubba‛al, Giḏ‛on, according to all the good which
he did for Yisra’ĕl. 
Judges
9:1  And Aḇimeleḵ son of
Yerubba‛al went to Sheḵem, to his mother’s brothers, and spoke with
them and with all the clan of the house of his mother’s father, saying, 
Judges
9:2  “Please speak in the hearing of all
the masters of Sheḵem, ‘Which is better for you, that seventy men, all
the sons of Yerubba‛al rule over you, or that one man rule over you?’ And
you shall remember that I am your own flesh and bone.” 
Judges
9:3  And his mother’s brothers spoke all
these words concerning him in the hearing of all the masters of Sheḵem.
And their heart inclined toward Aḇimeleḵ, for they said, “He is our
brother.” 
Judges
9:4  And they gave him seventy pieces of
silver from the house of Ba‛al-Berith, with which Aḇimeleḵ
hired worthless and reckless men. And they followed him. 
Judges
9:5  And he went to his father’s house at
Ophrah and slew his brothers, the seventy sons of Yerubba‛al, on one
stone. But Yotham the youngest son of Yerubba‛al was left, because he hid
himself. 
Judges
9:6  And all the masters of Sheḵem
gathered together, and all of Bĕyth Millo, and they went and made Aḇimeleḵ
sovereign beside the terebinth tree at the post that was in Sheḵem. 
Judges
9:7  And they informed Yotham, and he
went and stood on top of Mount Gerizim, and lifted his voice and cried out, and
said to them, “Hear me, you masters of Sheḵem, and let Elohim hear you! 
Judges
9:8  “The trees went forth to anoint a
sovereign over them. And they said to the olive tree, ‘reign over us!’ 
Judges
9:9  “And the olive tree said to them, ‘Shall
I leave my oil, with which they esteem mighty ones and men, and go to sway over
trees?’ 
Judges
9:10  “Then the trees said to the fig
tree, ‘Come, reign over us!’ 
Judges
9:11  “And the fig tree said to them, ‘Shall
I leave my sweetness and my good fruit, and go to sway over trees?’ 
Judges
9:12  “Then the trees said to the vine, ‘Come,
reign over us!’ 
Judges
9:13  “And the vine said to them, ‘Shall
I leave my new wine, which rejoices mighty ones and men, and go to sway over trees?’

Judges
9:14  “Then all the trees said to the
bramble, ‘Come, reign over us!’ 
Judges
9:15  “And the bramble said to the trees,
‘If in truth you anoint me as sovereign over you, come, take shelter in my
shade. But if not, let fire come out of the bramble and devour the cedars of Leḇanon!’

Judges
9:16  “And now, if you have acted in
truth and integrity in setting up Aḇimeleḵ to reign, and if you
have acted well with Yerubba‛al and his house, and have done to him as
his hands did to you – 
Judges
9:17  for my father fought for you and
risked his life, and delivered you out of the hand of Miḏyan, 
Judges
9:18  but you have risen up against my
father’s house today, and slew his seventy sons on one stone, and set up Aḇimeleḵ,
the son of his female servant, to reign over the masters of Sheḵem,
because he is your brother – 
Judges
9:19  if then you have acted in truth and
integrity with Yerubba‛al and with his house this day, then rejoice in Aḇimeleḵ,
and let him also rejoice in you. 
Judges
9:20  “But if not, let fire come out from
Aḇimeleḵ and devour the masters of Sheḵem and Bĕyth
Millo, and let fire come out from the masters of Sheḵem and from Bĕyth
Millo and devour Aḇimeleḵ!” 
Judges
9:21  Then Yotham ran away and fled, and
he went to Be’ĕr and dwelt there, for fear of Aḇimeleḵ his
brother. 
Judges
9:22  And Aḇimeleḵ governed
Yisra’ĕl three years, 
Judges
9:23  and Elohim sent an evil spirit
between Aḇimeleḵ and the masters of Sheḵem. And the masters
of Sheḵem acted treacherously against Aḇimeleḵ, 
Judges
9:24  in order that the violence done to
the seventy sons of Yerubba‛al might come, and their blood be laid on Aḇimeleḵ
their brother, who slew them, and on the masters of Sheḵem, who
strengthened his hands to slay his brothers. 
Judges
9:25  And the masters of Sheḵem set
men in ambush against him on the tops of the mountains, and they robbed all who
passed over by them along that way. And it was reported to Aḇimeleḵ.

Judges
9:26  And Ga‛al son of Eḇeḏ
came with his brothers and passed over to Sheḵem. And the masters of Sheḵem
put their trust in him, 
Judges
9:27  and went out into the fields, and
gathered their vineyards and trod out, and held a feast. And they went into the
house of their mighty one, and ate and drank, and cursed Aḇimeleḵ. 
Judges
9:28  And Ga‛al son of Eḇeḏ
said, “Who is Aḇimeleḵ, and who is Sheḵem, that we should
serve him? Is he not the son of Yerubba‛al, and is not Zeḇul his
officer? Serve the men of Ḥamor the father of Sheḵem! But why
should we serve him? 
Judges
9:29  “If only this people were under my
hand! Then I would remove Aḇimeleḵ.” And he said to Aḇimeleḵ,
“Increase your army and come out!” 
Judges
9:30  And when Zeḇul, the governor
of the city, heard the words of Ga‛al son of Eḇeḏ, his
displeasure burned. 
Judges
9:31  And he sent messengers to Aḇimeleḵ
by deceit, saying, “See, Ga‛al son of Eḇeḏ and his brothers
have come to Sheḵem. And see, they are besieging the city against you. 
Judges
9:32  “And now, get up by night, you and
the people who are with you, and lie in wait in the field. 
Judges
9:33  “And it shall be, as soon as the
sun is up in the morning, then rise early and rush upon the city. And see, when
he and the people who are with him come out against you, you shall do to them
as your hand finds to do.” 
Judges
9:34  And Aḇimeleḵ and all
the people who were with him rose up by night, and laid in wait against Sheḵem
in four companies. 
Judges
9:35  Now Ga‛al son of Eḇeḏ
went out and stood in the entrance to the city gate, and Aḇimeleḵ
and the people who were with him rose from lying in wait. 
Judges
9:36  And when Ga‛al saw the
people, he said to Zeḇul, “See, people are coming down from the tops of
the mountains!” But Zeḇul said to him, “You are seeing the shadows of the
mountains like men.” 
Judges
9:37  And Ga‛al spoke again and
said, “See, people are coming down from the high part of the land, and another
company is coming from the Diviners’ Terebinth Tree.” 
Judges
9:38  And Zeḇul said to him, “Now
where is your mouth with which you said, ‘Who is Aḇimeleḵ, that we
should serve him?’ Are not these the people whom you despised? I beg you, go
out and fight them now.” 
Judges
9:39  So Ga‛al went out, leading
the masters of Sheḵem, and fought Aḇimeleḵ. 
Judges
9:40  And Aḇimeleḵ pursued
him, and he fled from him. And many fell wounded, up to the entrance of the
gate. 
Judges
9:41  And Aḇimeleḵ stayed at
Arumah, and Zeḇul drove out Ga‛al and his brothers, so that they
would not dwell in Sheḵem. 
Judges
9:42  And it came to be the next day that
the people went out into the field, and they informed Aḇimeleḵ. 
Judges
9:43  And he took his people, and divided
them into three companies, and laid in wait in the field, and looked and saw
the people coming out of the city. And he rose against them and smote them. 
Judges
9:44  And Aḇimeleḵ and the
company that was with him rushed forward and stood at the entrance of the gate
of the city. And the other two companies rushed upon all who were in the fields
and smote them. 
Judges
9:45  And Aḇimeleḵ fought
against the city all that day, and captured the city and slew the people who
were in it. And he broke down the city and sowed it with salt. 
Judges
9:46  And all the masters of the tower of
Sheḵem had heard that, and entered the stronghold of the house of Ĕl
Berith. 
Judges
9:47  And it was reported to Aḇimeleḵ
that all the masters of the tower of Sheḵem were gathered together. 
Judges
9:48  So Aḇimeleḵ went up to
Mount Tsalmon, he and all the people who were with him. And Aḇimeleḵ
took an axe in his hand and cut down a branch from the trees, and took it and
laid it on his shoulder. Then he said to the people who were with him, “What
you have seen me do, hurry, do as I have done.” 
Judges
9:49  And all the people likewise cut
down each one his own branch and followed Aḇimeleḵ, and put them
against the stronghold, and set the stronghold on fire above them, so that all
the men of the tower of Sheḵem died, about a thousand men and women. 
Judges
9:50  Aḇimeleḵ then went to
Thĕḇĕts, and he encamped against Thĕḇĕts and
captured it. 
Judges
9:51  However, there was a strong tower
in the city, and all the men and women and all the masters of the city fled
there and shut themselves in, and went up to the top of the tower. 
Judges
9:52  And Aḇimeleḵ came to
the tower and fought against it, and approached the door of the tower to burn
it with fire. 
Judges
9:53  But a certain woman dropped an
upper millstone on the head of Aḇimeleḵ, and crushed his skull. 
Judges
9:54  He then immediately called the
young man, his armour-bearer, and said to him, “Draw your sword and kill me,
lest men say of me, ‘A woman killed him.’ ” And his young man thrust him
through, and he died. 
Judges
9:55  And when the men of Yisra’ĕl
saw that Aḇimeleḵ was dead, each one went to his own place. 
Judges
9:56  Thus did Elohim repay the evil of Aḇimeleḵ,
which he had done to his father to slay his seventy brothers. 
Judges
9:57  And all the evil of the men of Sheḵem
Elohim turned back on their own heads, and the curse of Yotham son of Yerubba‛al
came on them. 
Judges
10:1  And after Aḇimeleḵ
there arose Tola son of Pu’ah, son of Doḏo, a man of Yissasḵar, to
save Yisra’ĕl. And he dwelt in Shamur in the mountains of Ephrayim. 
Judges
10:2  And he ruled Yisra’ĕl
twenty-three years. Then he died and was buried in Shamur. 
Judges
10:3  And after him arose Ya’ir, a Gil‛aḏite,
and he ruled Yisra’ĕl twenty-two years. 
Judges
10:4  And he had thirty sons who rode on
thirty donkeys. And they had thirty towns, which are called Hawoth Yair to this
day, which are in the land of Gil‛aḏ. 
Judges
10:5  And Ya’ir died, and was buried in
Qamon. 
Judges
10:6  And the children of Yisra’ĕl
again did evil in the eyes of יהוה, and served the Ba‛als
and the Ashtoreths, and the mighty ones of Aram, and the mighty ones of Tsiḏon,
and the mighty ones of Mo’aḇ, and the mighty ones of the children of
Ammon, and the mighty ones of the Philistines – and forsook יהוה
and did not serve Him. 
Judges
10:7  Therefore the displeasure of יהוה
burned against Yisra’ĕl. And He sold them into the hands of the
Philistines and into the hands of the children of Ammon. 
Judges
10:8  And they crushed and oppressed the
children of Yisra’ĕl that year – for eighteen years – all the children of
Yisra’ĕl who were beyond the Yardĕn in the land of the Amorites, in
Gil‛aḏ. 
Judges
10:9  And the children of Ammon passed
over the Yardĕn to fight against Yehuḏah, and against Binyamin, and
against the house of Ephrayim, so that Yisra’ĕl had great distress. 
Judges
10:10  And the children of Yisra’ĕl
cried out to יהוה, saying, “We have sinned against You,
because we have both forsaken our Elohim and served the Ba‛als!” 
Judges
10:11  So יהוה
said to the children of Yisra’ĕl, “Was it not from the Mitsrites and from
the Amorites and from the children of Ammon and from the Philistines that I saved you? 
Judges
10:12  “And the Tsiḏonians and Amalĕq
and Ma‛on oppressed you. And you cried out to Me, and I saved you from
their hand. 
Judges
10:13  “But you, you have forsaken Me and
served other mighty ones. Therefore I do not save you again. 
Judges
10:14  “Go and cry out to the mighty ones
which you have chosen, let them save you in your time of distress.” 
Judges
10:15  And the children of Yisra’ĕl
said to יהוה, “We have sinned! Do to us whatever is
good in Your eyes, only deliver us today, please.” 
Judges
10:16  So they put away the foreign
mighty ones from their midst and served יהוה. And His
being was grieved with the trouble of Yisra’ĕl. 
Judges
10:17  Then the children of Ammon were
called together and encamped in Gil‛aḏ. And the children of Yisra’ĕl
gathered together and encamped in Mitspah. 
Judges
10:18  And the people, the heads of Gil‛aḏ,
said to each other, “Let the man who is the first to fight against the children
of Ammon be head over all the inhabitants of Gil‛aḏ.” 
Judges
11:1  And Yiphtaḥ the Gil‛aḏite
was a mighty brave one, but he was the son of a whore. And Gil‛aḏ
brought forth Yiphtaḥ. 
Judges
11:2  And the wife of Gil‛aḏ
bore sons. And when his wife’s sons grew up, they drove Yiphtaḥ out, and
said to him, “You shall not have an inheritance in the house of our father, for
you are the son of another woman.” 
Judges
11:3  And Yiphtaḥ fled from his
brothers and dwelt in the land of Toḇ. And worthless men banded together
with Yiphtaḥ and went out with him. 
Judges
11:4  And it came to be, some time later,
that the children of Ammon fought against Yisra’ĕl. 
Judges
11:5  And it came to be, when the
children of Ammon fought against Yisra’ĕl, that the elders of Gil‛aḏ
went to bring Yiphtaḥ out of the land of Toḇ. 
Judges
11:6  And they said to Yiphtaḥ, “Come,
and you shall be our commander, and let us fight against the children of Ammon.”

Judges
11:7  But Yiphtaḥ said to the
elders of Gil‛aḏ, “Did you not hate me, and drive me from my father’s
house? Why have you come to me now when you are in trouble?” 
Judges
11:8  And the elders of Gil‛aḏ
said to Yiphtaḥ, “That is the reason we have turned to you, that you
shall go with us and fight against the children of Ammon, and be our head over
all the inhabitants of Gil‛aḏ.” 
Judges
11:9  And Yiphtaḥ said to the
elders of Gil‛aḏ, “If you take me back home to fight against the
children of Ammon, and יהוה gives them to me, am I to
be your head?” 
Judges
11:10  And the elders of Gil‛aḏ
said to Yiphtaḥ, “ יהוה is witness between us, if
we do not do according to your words.” 
Judges
11:11  Then Yiphtaḥ went with the
elders of Gil‛aḏ, and the people set him over them, as head and
commander. And Yiphtaḥ spoke all his words before יהוה
in Mitspah. 
Judges
11:12  And Yiphtaḥ sent messengers
to the sovereign of the children of Ammon, saying, “What is between you and me,
that you have come to fight against me in my land?”
Judges
11:13  And the sovereign of the children
of Ammon said to the messengers of Yiphtaḥ, “Because Yisra’ĕl took
my land when they came up out of Mitsrayim, from the Arnon as far as the
Yabboq, and to the Yardĕn. And now, give back those lands in peace.” 
Judges
11:14  But Yiphtaḥ again sent
messengers to the sovereign of the children of Ammon, 
Judges
11:15  and said to him, “This is what
Yiphtaḥ said, ‘Yisra’ĕl did not take the land of Mo’aḇ, nor
the land of the children of Ammon. 
Judges
11:16  ‘For when they came up from
Mitsrayim, and Yisra’ĕl walked through the wilderness as far as the Sea of
Reeds and came to Qaḏĕsh, 
Judges
11:17  then Yisra’ĕl sent messengers
to the sovereign of Eḏom, saying, “Please let me pass over, through your
land.” But the sovereign of Eḏom would not listen. And they also sent to
the sovereign of Mo’aḇ, but he refused, so Yisra’ĕl stayed at Qaḏĕsh.

Judges
11:18  ‘Then they went through the
wilderness and around the land of Eḏom and the land of Mo’aḇ, and
came to the east side of the land of Mo’aḇ, and encamped beyond Arnon.
But they did not enter the border of Mo’aḇ, for Arnon was the border of
Mo’aḇ. 
Judges
11:19  ‘And Yisra’ĕl sent messengers
to Siḥon sovereign of the Amorites, sovereign of Ḥeshbon, and Yisra’ĕl
said to him, “Please let us pass over, through your land into our place.” 
Judges
11:20  ‘But Siḥon did not trust
Yisra’ĕl to pass over through his border, and Siḥon gathered all his
people together, and they encamped in Yahats, and fought against Yisra’ĕl.

Judges
11:21  ‘And יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl gave Siḥon and all his people into the hand of
Yisra’ĕl, and they smote them. So Yisra’ĕl took possession of all the
land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that land. 
Judges
11:22  ‘Thus they took possession of all
the border of the Amorites, from Arnon to the Yabboq and from the wilderness to
the Yardĕn. 
Judges
11:23  ‘And now, יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl has driven out the Amorites from before His people
Yisra’ĕl, should you then possess it? 
Judges
11:24  ‘Whatever Kemosh your mighty one
gives you to possess, do you not possess it? And all that which יהוה
our Elohim takes possession of before us, we possess. 
Judges
11:25  ‘And now are you any better than
Balaq son of Tsippor, sovereign of Mo’aḇ? Did he ever strive against
Yisra’ĕl? Did he ever fight against them? 
Judges
11:26  ‘While Yisra’ĕl dwelt in Ḥeshbon
and its villages, and in Aro‛ĕr and its villages, and in all the
cities along the banks of Arnon, for three hundred years, why did you not
recover them within that time? 
Judges
11:27  ‘So I have not sinned against you,
but you are doing me evil by fighting against me. Let יהוה
the Judge, judge today between the children of Yisra’ĕl and the children
of Ammon.’ ” 
Judges
11:28  But the sovereign of the children
of Ammon did not listen to the words which Yiphtaḥ sent him. 
Judges
11:29  And the Spirit of יהוה
came upon Yiphtaḥ, and he passed through Gil‛aḏ and
Menashsheh, and passed through Mitspeh of Gil‛aḏ. And from Mitspeh
of Gil‛aḏ he passed on toward the children of Ammon. 
Judges
11:30  And Yiphtaḥ made a vow to יהוה,
and said, “If You give the children of Ammon into my hands, 
Judges
11:31  then it shall be that whatever
comes out of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the
children of Ammon, shall belong to יהוה, and I shall
offer it up as a burnt offering.” 
Judges
11:32  Yiphtaḥ then passed on
toward the children of Ammon to fight against them, and יהוה
gave them into his hands. 
Judges
11:33  And he smote them from Aro‛ĕr
as far as Minnith, twenty cities, and to Aḇĕl Keramim, with a very
great slaughter. Thus the children of Ammon were humbled before the children of
Yisra’ĕl. 
Judges
11:34  And Yiphtaḥ came to his
house at Mitspah, and saw his daughter coming out to meet him with timbrels and
dancing. Now except for her he had neither son nor daughter. 
Judges
11:35  And it came to be, when he saw
her, that he tore his garments, and said, “Oh my daughter! You have brought me
very low, and you are among those who trouble me! And I, I have given my word
to יהוה, and I am unable to turn back.” 
Judges
11:36  And she said to him, “My father,
if you have given your word to יהוה, do to me according
to what has gone out of your mouth, because יהוה has
taken vengeance for you upon your enemies, the children of Ammon.” 
Judges
11:37  And she said to her father, “Let
this be done for me: let me alone for two months, and let me go and wander on
the mountains and bewail my maidenhood, my friends and I.” 
Judges
11:38  Then he said, “Go.” And he sent
her away for two months. And she went with her friends, and bewailed her
maidenhood on the mountains. 
Judges
11:39  And it came to be at the end of
two months that she returned to her father, and he did to her as he had vowed,
and she knew no man. And it became a statute in Yisra’ĕl 
Judges
11:40  that the daughters of Yisra’ĕl
went every year for four days to lament the daughter of Yiphtaḥ the Gil‛aḏite.

Judges
12:1  And the men of Ephrayim gathered
together, and passed over toward Tsaphon, and said to Yiphtaḥ, “Why did
you pass over to fight against the children of Ammon, and did not call us to go
with you? We are going to burn your house over you with fire!” 
Judges
12:2  And Yiphtaḥ said to them, “My
people and I were in a great struggle with the children of Ammon. And when I
called you, you did not save me out of their hands. 
Judges
12:3  “And I saw that you would not save
me, then I took my life in my hands and went over against the children of
Ammon. And יהוה gave them into my hand. And why have
you come up to me today to fight against me?” 
Judges
12:4  Yiphtaḥ then gathered together
all the men of Gil‛aḏ and fought against Ephrayim. And the men of
Gil‛aḏ smote Ephrayim, because they had said, “You Gil‛aḏites
are fugitives of Ephrayim in the midst of Ephrayim, in the midst of Menashsheh.”

Judges
12:5  And Gil‛aḏ captured the
fords of the Yardĕn that faced Ephrayim. And it came to be, when the
fugitives from Ephrayim said, “Let me pass over,” the men of Gil‛aḏ
said to him, “You are an Ephrayimite!” If he said, “No,” 
Judges
12:6  then they would say to him, “Please
say, ‘Shibboleth’!” And he would say, “Sibboleth,” for he was unable to
pronounce it right. Then they seized him and slew him at the fords of the Yardĕn.
And at that time there fell forty-two thousand Ephrayimites. 
Judges
12:7  And Yiphtaḥ ruled Yisra’ĕl
six years. And Yiphtaḥ the Gil‛aḏite died and was buried in
one of the cities of Gil‛aḏ. 
Judges
12:8  And after him, Iḇtsan of Bĕyth
Leḥem ruled Yisra’ĕl. 
Judges
12:9  And he came to have thirty sons and
thirty daughters – he sent abroad and brought in thirty daughters for his sons.
And he ruled Yisra’ĕl seven years. 
Judges
12:10  And Iḇtsan died and was
buried at Bĕyth Leḥem. 
Judges
12:11  And after him Ĕlon the Zeḇulunite
ruled Yisra’ĕl. And he ruled Yisra’ĕl ten years. 
Judges
12:12  And Ĕlon the Zeḇulunite
died and was buried at Ayalon in the land of Zeḇulun. 
Judges
12:13  And after him, Aḇdon son of
Hillĕl the Pirathonite ruled Yisra’ĕl, 
Judges
12:14  and he had forty sons and thirty
grandsons, who rode on seventy young donkeys. And he ruled Yisra’ĕl eight
years. 
Judges
12:15  And Aḇdon son of Hillĕl
the Pirathonite died and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephrayim, in the
mountains of the Amalĕqites. 
Judges
13:1  And again the children of Yisra’ĕl
did evil in the eyes of יהוה, so יהוה
gave them into the hand of the Philistines for forty years. 
Judges
13:2  And there was a certain man from
Tsor‛ah, of the clan of the Danites, whose name was Manowaḥ. And
his wife was barren and had not borne. 
Judges
13:3  And a Messenger of יהוה
appeared to the woman and said to her, “See now, you are barren and have not
borne, but you shall conceive, and you shall bear a son. 
Judges
13:4  “And now, please guard, and do not
drink wine or strong drink, and do not eat any unclean food. 
Judges
13:5  “For look, you are conceiving and
bearing a son. And let no razor come upon his head, for the youth is a Nazirite
to Elohim from the womb on. And he shall begin to save Yisra’ĕl out of the
hand of the Philistines.” 
Judges
13:6  And the woman came and spoke to her
husband, saying, “A Man of Elohim came to me, and His appearance was like the
appearance of a Messenger of Elohim, very awesome. But I did not ask Him where
He was from, and He did not declare to me His name. 
Judges
13:7  “And He said to me, ‘See, you are
conceiving and bearing a son. And now, drink no wine or strong drink, nor eat
any unclean food, for the youth is a
Nazirite to Elohim from the womb to the day of his death.’ ” 
Judges
13:8  And Manowaḥ prayed to יהוה,
and said, “O יהוה, please let the Man of Elohim whom
You sent come to us again and teach us what to do for the youth who is to be
born.” 
Judges
13:9  And Elohim listened to the voice of
Manowaḥ, and the Messenger of Elohim came to the woman again as she was
sitting in the field, but Manowaḥ her husband was not with her. 
Judges
13:10  And the woman ran hurriedly and
informed her husband, and said to him, “See, He has appeared to me, the Man who
came to me the other day!” 
Judges
13:11  And Manowaḥ arose and went
after his wife, and came to the Man, and he said to Him, “Are You the Man who
spoke to this woman?” And He said, “I am.” 
Judges
13:12  And Manowaḥ said, “Now let
Your words come true! What is to be the rule for the youth’s life and his work?”

Judges
13:13  And the Messenger of יהוה
said to Manowaḥ, “Let the woman guard all that I said to her. 
Judges
13:14  “Let her not eat any food that comes from the vine, neither
let her drink wine or strong drink, or eat any unclean food. Let her guard all that which I have commanded her.” 
Judges
13:15  And Manowaḥ said to the
Messenger of יהוה, “Please let us detain You, and
prepare a young goat for You.” 
Judges
13:16  And the Messenger of יהוה
said to Manowaḥ, “Though you detain Me, I do not eat your food. But if
you offer a burnt offering, offer it to יהוה.” For
Manowaḥ did not know He was a Messenger of יהוה. 
Judges
13:17  Then Manowaḥ said to the
Messenger of יהוה, “What is Your name? When Your words
come true, then we shall esteem You.” 
Judges
13:18  And the Messenger of יהוה
said to him, “Why do you ask My name, since it is wondrous?” 
Judges
13:19  And Manowaḥ took the young
goat with the grain offering, and offered it upon the rock to יהוה.
And He did wondrously while Manowaḥ and his wife looked on. 
Judges
13:20  And it came to be, as the flame
went up toward the heavens from the altar, that the Messenger of יהוה
went up in the flame of the altar. And Manowaḥ and his wife were
watching, and they fell on their faces to the ground. 
Judges
13:21  And the Messenger of יהוה
did not appear any more to Manowaḥ and his wife. Then Manowaḥ knew
that He was a Messenger of יהוה. 
Judges
13:22  And Manowaḥ said to his
wife, “We shall certainly die, because we have seen Elohim!” 
Judges
13:23  But his wife said to him, “If יהוה
had been pleased to put us to death, He would not have accepted a burnt
offering and a grain offering from our hands, nor would He have shown us all
this, nor would He have let us hear the like of this!” 
Judges
13:24  So the woman bore a son and called
his name Shimshon. And the child grew, and יהוה blessed
him. 
Judges
13:25  And the Spirit of יהוה
began to move him at Maḥanĕh Dan, between Tsor‛ah and Eshta’ol.

Judges
14:1  And Shimshon went down to Timnah,
and saw a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines. 
Judges
14:2  And he went up and informed his
father and mother, saying, “I have seen a woman in Timnah of the daughters of
the Philistines. And now, take her for me for a wife.” 
Judges
14:3  But his father and mother said to
him, “Is there no woman among the daughters of your brothers, or among all my
people, that you should take a wife from the uncircumcised Philistines?” And
Shimshon said to his father, “Take her for me, for she is pleasing in my eyes.”

Judges
14:4  However, his father and mother did
not know that it was of יהוה, that He was seeking an
occasion to move against the Philistines. For at that time the Philistines were
ruling over Yisra’ĕl. 
Judges
14:5  Then Shimshon went down to Timnah
with his father and mother, and came to the vineyards of Timnah, and saw a
young lion came roaring at him. 
Judges
14:6  And the Spirit of יהוה
came mightily upon him, and he tore it apart as the tearing apart of a young
goat, with naught in his hand. But he did not make known to his father or his
mother what he had done. 
Judges
14:7  And he went down and spoke to the
woman, and she pleased Shimshon well. 
Judges
14:8  And when he returned later to take
her, he turned aside to look at the carcass of the lion, and saw a swarm of
bees and honey in the carcass of the lion. 
Judges
14:9  And he took some of it in his hands
and went along, eating. And he came to his father and mother, and gave them,
and they ate. But he did not make known to them that he took the honey out of
the carcass of the lion. 
Judges
14:10  So his father went down to the
woman. And Shimshon gave a feast there, for young men used to do so. 
Judges
14:11  And it came to be, when they saw
him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him. 
Judges
14:12  And Shimshon said to them, “Please
let me put forth a riddle to you. If you clearly solve and explain it to me
within the seven days of the feast, then I shall give you thirty linen garments
and thirty changes of garments. 
Judges
14:13  “But if you are unable to explain
it to me, then you shall give me thirty linen shirts and thirty changes of
garments.” And they said to him, “Put forth your riddle and let us hear it.” 
Judges
14:14  And he said to them, “Out of the
eater came forth food, and out of the strong came forth sweetness.” And for
three days they were unable to explain the riddle. 
Judges
14:15  And it came to be on the seventh
day that they said to Shimshon’s wife, “Entice your husband to explain the
riddle to us, or else we burn you and your father’s house with fire. Have you
invited us in order to take what is ours? Is it not?” 
Judges
14:16  And Shimshon’s wife wept before
him, and said, “You only hate me, and do not love me! You have put forth a
riddle to the sons of my people, but you have not explained it to me.” And he
said to her, “Look, I have not explained it to my father or my mother, and
should I explain it to you?” 
Judges
14:17  And she had wept before him the
seven days while their feast lasted. And it came to be on the seventh day that
he informed her, because she pressed him so much. She then explained the riddle
to the sons of her people. 
Judges
14:18  And the men of the city said to
him on the seventh day before the sun went down, “What is sweeter than honey?
And what is stronger than a lion?” And he said to them, “If you had not
ploughed with my heifer, you would not have solved my riddle!” 
Judges
14:19  Then the Spirit of יהוה
came upon him mightily, and he went down to Ashqelon and smote thirty of their
men, stripped them, and gave the changes of
garments to those who had explained the riddle. And his displeasure burned,
and he went back up to his father’s house. 
Judges
14:20  And Shimshon’s wife was given to
his companion, who had been his friend. 
Judges
15:1  And it came to be, after some time,
in the days of wheat harvest, that Shimshon visited his wife with a young goat.
And he said, “Let me go in to my wife, into her room.” But her father would not
permit him to go in. 
Judges
15:2  And her father said, “Indeed, I
thought that you hated her intensely; so I gave her to your companion. Is not
her younger sister better than she? Please, take her instead.” 
Judges
15:3  And Shimshon said to them, “This
time I am blameless regarding the Philistines if I do evil to them!”
Judges
15:4  And Shimshon went and caught three
hundred foxes, and took torches, and turned them tail to tail, and put a torch
between each pair of tails, 
Judges
15:5  and set the torches on fire, and
sent them out into the standing grain of the Philistines, and burned up both
the shocks and the standing grain, even the vineyards and olive-trees. 
Judges
15:6  And the Philistines said, “Who did
this?” And they answered, “Shimshon, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he
took away his wife and gave her to his companion.” Then the Philistines went up
and burned her and her father with fire. 
Judges
15:7  And Shimshon said to them, “Though
you do this, yet I shall take revenge on you, and after that I cease.” 
Judges
15:8  And he smote them hip and thigh, a
great slaughter, and went down and dwelt in the cleft of the rock of Ĕytam.

Judges
15:9  The Philistines then went up and
encamped in Yehuḏah, and spread out against Leḥi. 
Judges
15:10  And the men of Yehuḏah said,
“Why have you come up against us?” And they answered, “We have come up to bind
Shimshon, to do to him as he has did to us.” 
Judges
15:11  Then three thousand men of Yehuḏah
went down to the cleft of the rock of Ĕytam and said to Shimshon, “Do you
not know that the Philistines are rulers over us? Why have you have done this
to us?” And he said to them, “As they did to me, so I did to them.” 
Judges
15:12  And they said to him, “We have
come down to bind you, to give you into the hand of the Philistines.” And
Shimshon said to them, “Swear to me not to fall on me yourselves.” 
Judges
15:13  And they spoke to him, saying, “No,
but we are certainly going to bind you, and shall give you into their hand but
certainly not kill you.” So they bound him with two new ropes and brought him
up from the rock. 
Judges
15:14  When he came to Leḥi, the
Philistines came shouting to meet him. And the Spirit of יהוה
came mightily upon him. And the ropes that were on his arms became like flax
that is burned with fire, and his bonds broke loose from his hands. 
Judges
15:15  And he found a fresh jawbone of a
donkey, and put out his hand and took it, and smote a thousand men with it. 
Judges
15:16  And Shimshon said, “With the
jawbone of a donkey, one heap, two heaps, with the jawbone of a donkey I have
smitten a thousand men!” 
Judges
15:17  And it came to be, when he had
ended speaking, that he threw the jawbone from his hand, and called that place
Ramath Leḥi. 
Judges
15:18  And he became very thirsty, and
cried out to יהוה and said, “You have given this great
deliverance by the hand of Your servant. And now, am I to die of thirst and
fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?” 
Judges
15:19  And Elohim split the hollow place
that is in Leḥi, and water came out, and he drank. And his spirit came
back, and he revived. So he called its name Ĕn Haqqore, which is in
Leḥi to this day. 
Judges
15:20  And he ruled Yisra’ĕl twenty
years in the days of the Philistines. 
Judges
16:1  And Shimshon went to Azzah and saw
a woman there, a whore, and went in to her – 
Judges
16:2  the Azzathites saying, “Shimshon
has come here!” So they went round and lay in wait for him all night at the
gate of the city, and kept silent all night, saying, “In the morning, when it
is daylight, then we shall kill him.” 
Judges
16:3  Now Shimshon lay until midnight,
and rose at midnight, and took hold of the doors of the gate of the city and
the two gateposts, and pulled them up with the bar, put them on his shoulders,
and took them to the top of the hill that faces Ḥeḇron. 
Judges
16:4  And it came to be afterward that he
loved a woman in the wadi Sorĕq, whose name was Delilah. 
Judges
16:5  And the princes of the Philistines
came up to her and said to her, “Entice him, and find out where his great
strength lies, and see by what we might overpower him, then we shall bind him
to humble him. And let us give you, each one of us, eleven hundred pieces of
silver.” 
Judges
16:6  And Delilah said to Shimshon, “Please
reveal to me where your great strength lies, and by what you might be bound, to
humble you.” 
Judges
16:7  And Shimshon said to her, “If they
bind me with seven fresh cords, not yet dried, then I shall be weak, and be
like any other man.” 
Judges
16:8  The princes of the Philistines then
brought her seven fresh cords, not yet dried, and she bound him with them, 
Judges
16:9  while those lying in wait stayed
with her in the room. And she said to him, “The Philistines are upon you,
Shimshon!” But he broke the cords as a strand of yarn breaks when it touches
fire. So the secret of his strength remained unknown. 
Judges
16:10  And Delilah said to Shimshon, “Look,
you have mocked me and spoken lies to me. Now, please reveal to me by what you
might be bound.” 
Judges
16:11  And he said to her, “If they bind
me tightly with new ropes that have never been used, then I shall be weak, and
be like any other man.” 
Judges
16:12  And Delilah took new ropes and
bound him with them, and said to him, “The Philistines are upon you, Shimshon!”
And those lying in wait were sitting in the inner room. But he broke them off
his arms like a thread. 
Judges
16:13  So Delilah said to Shimshon, “Until
now you have mocked me and spoken lies to me, reveal to me how you might be
bound.” And he said to her, “If you weave the seven locks of my head with the
web.” 
Judges
16:14  Then she fastened it with a pin,
and said to him, “The Philistines are upon you, Shimshon!” But he awoke from
his sleep, and pulled out the pin of the loom and the web. 
Judges
16:15  Then she said to him, “How do you
say, ‘I love you,’ when your heart is not with me? You have mocked me these
three times, and have not made known to me where your great strength lies.” 
Judges
16:16  And it came to be, when she
pressed him daily with her words and urged him, so that his being was wearied
to death, 
Judges
16:17  that he made known to her all his
heart, and said to her, “No razor has ever come upon my head, for I have been a
Nazirite to Elohim from my mother’s womb. If I were shaven, then my strength
would leave me, and I would become as weak as any other man.” 
Judges
16:18  And Delilah saw that he had made
known to her all his heart, and she sent and called for the princes of the
Philistines, saying, “Come up once more, for he has made known to me all his
heart.” So the princes of the Philistines came up to her and brought the money
in their hand. 
Judges
16:19  And she made him sleep on her
knees, and called for a man and shaved off the seven locks of his head. Thus
she began to humble him, and his strength left him. 
Judges
16:20  And she said, “The Philistines are
upon you, Shimshon!” And he awoke from his sleep, and said, “Let me go out as
before, at other times, and shake myself loose!” But he did not know that יהוה
had turned aside from him. 
Judges
16:21  So the Philistines took him and
put out his eyes, and brought him down to Azzah, and bound him with bronze
shackles. And he became a grinder in the prison. 
Judges
16:22  But the hair of his head began to
grow again after it had been shaven. 
Judges
16:23  And the princes of the Philistines
gathered to offer a great slaughtering to Daḡon their mighty one, and to
rejoice. And they said, “Our mighty one has given Shimshon our enemy into our
hands!” 
Judges
16:24  And the people saw him, and
praised their mighty one, for they said, “Our mighty one has given into our
hands our enemy, the destroyer of our land, who slew many of us.” 
Judges
16:25  And it came to be, when their
hearts were glad, that they said, “Call for Shimshon, and let him entertain us.”
So they called for Shimshon from the prison, and he entertained them. And they
made him stand between the columns. 
Judges
16:26  And Shimshon said to the young man
who held him by the hand, “Let me alone and let me feel the columns which
support the house, so that I lean on them.” 
Judges
16:27  And the house was filled with men
and women. And all the princes of the Philistines were there. And about three
thousand men and women were on the roof who watched Shimshon entertaining. 
Judges
16:28  And Shimshon called to יהוה,
saying, “O Master יהוה, remember me, I pray! Strengthen
me, I pray, only this time, O Elohim, and let me avenge myself on the
Philistines with vengeance for my two eyes!” 
Judges
16:29  And Shimshon took hold of the two
middle columns which supported the house, and he braced himself against them,
one on his right and the other on his left. 
Judges
16:30  And Shimshon said, “Let me die
with the Philistines!” And he bowed himself mightily, and the house fell on the
princes and all the people in it. And the dead that he killed at his death were
more than he had killed in his life. 
Judges
16:31  And his brothers and all his
father’s household came down and took him, and brought him up and buried him
between Tsor‛ah and Eshta’ol in the tomb of his father Manowaḥ. And
he had ruled Yisra’ĕl twenty years. 
Judges
17:1  And there was a man from the hill
country of Ephrayim, whose name was Miḵahu. 
Judges
17:2  And he said to his mother, “The
eleven hundred pieces of silver that were taken from you, and on which you put
a curse, even saying it in my ears. Look, the silver is with me, I took it.”
And his mother said, “Blessed of יהוה be my son!” 
Judges
17:3  And he gave back the eleven hundred
pieces of silver to his mother, and his mother said, “I had truly set apart the
silver from my hand to יהוה for my son, to make a
carved image and a moulded image, and now, I give it back to you.” 
Judges
17:4  And he gave the silver back to his
mother, and his mother took two hundred pieces of silver and gave them to the
silversmith, and he made it into a carved image and a moulded image. And they
were in the house of Miḵahu. 
Judges
17:5  Now the man Miḵah had a house
of mighty ones, and made a shoulder garment and house idols. And he ordained
one of his sons, who became his priest. 
Judges
17:6  In those days there was no
sovereign in Yisra’ĕl – everyone did what was right in his own eyes.
Judges
17:7  And there was a young man from Bĕyth
Leḥem in Yehuḏah, of the clan of Yehuḏah. And he was a Lĕwite,
and he was sojourning there. 
Judges
17:8  And the man went out of the city of
Bĕyth Leḥem in Yehuḏah to sojourn wherever he could find a
place. And he came to the mountains of Ephrayim, to the house of Miḵah,
as he journeyed. 
Judges
17:9  And Miḵah said to him, “Where
do you come from?” And he said to him, “I am a Lĕwite from Bĕyth
Leḥem in Yehuḏah, and I am on my way to find a place to sojourn.” 
Judges
17:10  And Miḵah said to him, “Dwell
with me, and be a father and a priest to me, and I give you ten pieces of
silver per year, and a suit of garments, and your food.” And the Lĕwite
went in. 
Judges
17:11  So the Lĕwite agreed to dwell
with the man. And the young man became like one of his sons to him. 
Judges
17:12  Then Miḵah ordained the Lĕwite,
and the young man became his priest, and he was in the house of Miḵah. 
Judges
17:13  And Miḵah said, “Now I know
that יהוה does good to me, since I have a Lĕwite
as priest!” 
Judges
18:1  In those days there was no
sovereign in Yisra’ĕl. And in those days the tribe of the Danites was
seeking an inheritance for itself to dwell in, for until that day all their
inheritance among the tribes of Yisra’ĕl had not yet fallen to them. 
Judges
18:2  And the children of Dan sent five
men of their clan, brave men from Tsor‛ah and Eshta’ol, to spy out the
land and search it. And they said to them, “Go, search the land,” so they went
to the mountains of Ephrayim, to the house of Miḵah, and spent the night
there. 
Judges
18:3  When they were near the house of Miḵah,
they recognised the voice of the young Lĕwite, and turned aside and said
to him, “Who brought you here? What are you doing in this place, and what do
you have here?” 
Judges
18:4  And he said to them, “Miḵah
did such and such for me. And he hired me, and I have become his priest.” 
Judges
18:5  And they said to him, “Please inquire
of Elohim, and we shall know whether the journey on which we are going is
prosperous.” 
Judges
18:6  And the priest said to them, “Go in
peace. Your journey on which you go is before יהוה.” 
Judges
18:7  Then the five men left and came to
Layish, and saw the people who were in their midst, how they dwelt safely,
according to the ruling of the Tsiḏonians, at rest and unsuspecting. And
no one possessing authority in the land was reproaching for any matter. And
they were far from the Tsiḏonians, and they had no word with anyone. 
Judges
18:8  And the spies came back to their
brothers at Tsor‛ah and Eshta’ol, and their brothers said to them, “What
do you say?” 
Judges
18:9  And they said, “Arise, and let us
go up against them. For we have seen the land, and look, it is very good. And
you sit still! Do not hesitate to go to enter in to possess the land. 
Judges
18:10  “When you go, you are to come to
an unsuspecting people, and the land is spacious. For Elohim has given it into
your hands, a place in which there is no lack of any matter which is on the
earth.” 
Judges
18:11  And six hundred men of the clan of
the Danites went from there, from Tsor‛ah and Eshta’ol, armed for battle.

Judges
18:12  And they went up and encamped in
Qiryath Ye‛arim in Yehuḏah. Therefore they call that place
Maḥanĕh Ḏan to this day. See, it is west of Qiryath Ye‛arim.

Judges
18:13  And they passed over from there to
the mountains of Ephrayim, and came to the house of Miḵah. 
Judges
18:14  And the five men who had gone to
spy out the land of Layish answered and said to their brothers, “Do you know
that there are in these houses a shoulder garment, and house idols, and a
carved image, and a moulded image? And now, you know what to do.” 
Judges
18:15  And they turned aside there, and came
to the house of the young Lĕwite man, the house of Miḵah, and
greeted him. 
Judges
18:16  And the six hundred men, armed for
battle, who were of the children of Dan, stood by the entrance of the gate. 
Judges
18:17  And the five men who had gone to
spy out the land went up, and entering there, they took the carved image, and
the shoulder garment, and the house idols, and the moulded image, while the
priest stood at the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men who were
armed for battle. 
Judges
18:18  And these went into Miḵah’s
house and took the idol, and the shoulder garment, and the house idols, and the
moulded image. Then the priest said to them, “What are you doing?” 
Judges
18:19  And they said to him, “Be silent,
put your hand over your mouth, and come with us, and be a father and a priest
to us. Is it better for you to be a priest to the household of one man, or that
you be a priest to a tribe and a clan in Yisra’ĕl?” 
Judges
18:20  And the heart of the priest was
glad. And he took the shoulder garment, and the house idols, and the carved
image, and took his place among the people. 
Judges
18:21  And they turned and went, and put
the little ones, and the livestock, and the valuables in front of them. 
Judges
18:22  They had gone some distance from
the house of Miḵah, when the men who were in the houses near Miḵah’s
house gathered together and overtook the children of Dan, 
Judges
18:23  and called out to the children of
Dan. So they turned around and said to Miḵah, “What is the matter, that
you have gathered such a company?” 
Judges
18:24  And he said, “You have taken away
my mighty ones which I made, and the priest, and you are leaving. Now what more
do I have? What is this you say to me, ‘What is the matter?’ ” 
Judges
18:25  And the children of Dan said to
him, “Do not let your voice be heard among us, lest men, bitter of being, fall
upon you, and you lose your life, with the lives of your household!” 
Judges
18:26  And the children of Dan went their
way. And when Miḵah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and
went back to his house. 
Judges
18:27  Then they took what Miḵah
had made, and the priest who had belonged to him, and went to Layish, to a
people who were at rest and unsuspecting, and smote them with the edge of the
sword and burned the city with fire. 
Judges
18:28  And there was no deliverer,
because it was far from Tsiḏon, and they had no word with anyone. And it
was in the valley that belongs to Bĕyth Reḥoḇ. And they
rebuilt the city and dwelt there. 
Judges
18:29  And they called the name of the
city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born to Yisra’ĕl.
But previously the name of the city was Layish. 
Judges
18:30  And the children of Dan set up for
themselves the carved image. And Yehonathan son of Gĕreshom, son of
Menashsheh, and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day the
land was taken into exile. 
Judges
18:31  And they set up for themselves the
carved image of Miḵah, which he had made, all the days that the house of
Elohim was in Shiloh. 
Judges
19:1  And it came to be in those days,
when there was no sovereign in Yisra’ĕl, that there was a certain Lĕwite
sojourning on the further side of the mountains of Ephrayim. And he took for
himself a concubine from Bĕyth Leḥem in Yehuḏah. 
Judges
19:2  And his concubine committed whoring
against him, and went away from him to her father’s house at Bĕyth
Leḥem in Yehuḏah, and was there four months. 
Judges
19:3  And her husband arose and went
after her, to speak to her heart and bring her back, having his servant and a
couple of donkeys with him. And she brought him into her father’s house. And
the father of the young woman saw him, and he was glad to meet him. 
Judges
19:4  And his father-in-law, the young
woman’s father, detained him, and he dwelt with him three days. And they ate
and drank and spent the nights there. 
Judges
19:5  And it came to be on the fourth day
that they arose early in the morning. And he prepared to leave, but the young
woman’s father said to his son-in-law, “Refresh your heart with a piece of
bread, and afterward go your way.” 
Judges
19:6  So they sat down, and the two of
them ate and drank together. And the young woman’s father said to the man, “Please
agree to stay all night, and let your heart be glad.” 
Judges
19:7  And when the man arose to go, his
father-in-law urged him. So he spent the night there again. 
Judges
19:8  And he arose early in the morning
on the fifth day to go. But the young woman’s father said, “Please refresh your
heart.” So they delayed until afternoon, and both of them ate. 
Judges
19:9  And the man arose to go, he and his
concubine and his servant. But his father-in-law, the young woman’s father,
said to him, “See, the day is now drawing toward evening. Please spend the
night. See, the day is coming to an end. Stay here, and let your heart be glad.
And you shall rise early tomorrow for your journey, and you shall go to your
tent.” 
Judges
19:10  But the man would not stay that
night. And he arose and left, and came to a place opposite Yeḇus, that is
Yerushalayim. And with him were the two saddled donkeys, and his concubine with
him. 
Judges
19:11  They were near Yeḇus, and
the day was far spent. And the servant said to his master, “Come, please, and
let us turn aside into this city of the Yeḇusites and spend the night in
it.” 
Judges
19:12  And his master said to him, “Let
us not turn aside here into a city of foreigners, who are not of the children
of Yisra’ĕl. But we shall pass over to Giḇ‛ah.” 
Judges
19:13  And he said to his servant, “Come,
let us draw near to one of these places, and spend the night in Giḇ‛ah
or in Ramah.” 
Judges
19:14  And they passed over and went
their way. And the sun went down on them near Giḇ‛ah, which belongs
to Binyamin, 
Judges
19:15  and they turned off there to go in
to spend the night in Giḇ‛ah. So he went in, and he sat down in the
open square of the city, for no one would take them into his house to spend the
night. 
Judges
19:16  But see, an old man came in from
his work in the field at evening, who also was from the mountains of Ephrayim.
And he was sojourning in Giḇ‛ah, whereas the men of the place were
Binyamites. 
Judges
19:17  And when he lifted up his eyes, he
saw the traveller in the open square of the city. And the old man said, “Where
are you going, and where do you come from?” 
Judges
19:18  And he said to him, “We are
passing over from Bĕyth Leḥem in Yehuḏah to the other side of
the mountains of Ephrayim. I am from there, and I went to Bĕyth
Leḥem in Yehuḏah, and I am going to the House of יהוה.
But there is no one taking me into his house, 
Judges
19:19  yet there is both straw and fodder
for our donkeys, and bread and wine for myself, and for your female servant,
and for the young man who is with your servant; there is no lack of any matter.”

Judges
19:20  And the old man said, “Peace be
with you! However, let all your needs be on me, only do not spend the night in
the open square.” 
Judges
19:21  And he brought him into his house,
and gave fodder to the donkeys. And they washed their feet, and ate and drank. 
Judges
19:22  They were making their hearts
glad, and see, men of the city, sons of Beliya‛al, surrounded the house,
beating on the door. And they spoke to the master of the house, the old man,
saying, “Bring out the man who came to your house, so that we know him!” 
Judges
19:23  But the man, the master of the
house, went out to them and said to them, “No, my brothers! I beg you, do no
evil! Since this man has come into my house, do not do this folly. 
Judges
19:24  “Look, here is my maiden daughter
and the man’s concubine. Let me bring them out now, and humble them, and do
with them what is good in your eyes, but do not do such a foolish matter to
this man!” 
Judges
19:25  But the men would not listen to
him. So the man took his concubine and brought her out to them. And they knew
her and rolled themselves on her all night until morning, and let her go when
the day began to break. 
Judges
19:26  And as morning appeared the woman
came back and fell down at the door of the man’s house where her master was,
till it was light. 
Judges
19:27  And her master rose up in the
morning, and opened the doors of the house and went out to go his way, and saw
his concubine, fallen at the door of the house with her hands on the threshold.

Judges
19:28  And he said to her, “Rise up and
let us go.” But there was no answer. Then he took her on the donkey, and the
man rose and went to his place, 
Judges
19:29  and came into his house and took a
knife, then laid hold of his concubine, and cut her up limb by limb into twelve
pieces, and sent her throughout all the borders of Yisra’ĕl. 
Judges
19:30  And it came to be that all who saw
it said, “There has never been, and there has not been seen the like of this,
from the day that the children of Yisra’ĕl came up from the land of
Mitsrayim until this day. Set your heart
on it, take counsel, and speak up!” 
Judges
20:1  And all the children of Yisra’ĕl
came out, from Dan to Be’ĕrsheḇa, and from the land of Gil‛aḏ,
and the congregation assembled as one man before יהוה
at Mitspah. 
Judges
20:2  And the leaders of all the people,
all the tribes of Yisra’ĕl, presented themselves in the assembly of the
people of Elohim, four hundred thousand foot soldiers who drew the sword. 
Judges
20:3  And the children of Binyamin heard
that the children of Yisra’ĕl had gone up to Mitspah. And the children of
Yisra’ĕl said, “Speak up, how did this evil come about?” 
Judges
20:4  And the man, the Lĕwite,
husband of the woman who was murdered, answered and said, “My concubine and I
went into Giḇ‛ah, which belongs to Binyamin, to spend the night. 
Judges
20:5  “And the masters of Giḇ‛ah
rose against me, and surrounded the house at night because of me. They thought
to kill me, but instead they humbled my concubine, and she died. 
Judges
20:6  “Then I took my concubine, and cut
her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the land of the inheritance of Yisra’ĕl,
because they committed wickedness and folly in Yisra’ĕl. 
Judges
20:7  “Look, you are all children of
Yisra’ĕl, speak and give your counsel here!” 
Judges
20:8  And all the people rose as one man,
saying, “Let not one of us go to his tent, nor any of us turn back to his
house. 
Judges
20:9  “And now, this is what we do to Giḇ‛ah:
go against it by lot. 
Judges
20:10  “And we shall take ten men out of
every hundred throughout all the tribes of Yisra’ĕl, and a hundred out of
every thousand, and a thousand out of every ten thousand, to make food for the
people, to prepare for their going to Giḇ‛ah in Binyamin, for all
the folly they did in Yisra’ĕl.”
Judges
20:11  And all the men of Yisra’ĕl
were gathered against the city, knit together as one man. 
Judges
20:12  And the tribes of Yisra’ĕl
sent men through all the tribe of Binyamin, saying, “What is this evil that has
come about among you? 
Judges
20:13  “And now, give us the men, the
sons of Beliya‛al who are in Giḇ‛ah, so that we put them to
death and put away evil from Yisra’ĕl!” But the children of Binyamin would
not listen to the voice of their brothers, the children of Yisra’ĕl. 
Judges
20:14  So the children of Binyamin
gathered together from their cities to Giḇ‛ah, to go to battle
against the children of Yisra’ĕl. 
Judges
20:15  And from their cities at that time
the children of Binyamin registered twenty-six thousand men who drew the sword,
besides the inhabitants of Giḇ‛ah, who registered seven hundred
chosen men. 
Judges
20:16  Among all this people there were
seven hundred chosen men who were left-handed, each one could sling a stone at
a hair’s breadth and not miss. 
Judges
20:17  And besides Binyamin, the men of
Yisra’ĕl registered four hundred thousand men who drew the sword, all of
these were men of battle. 
Judges
20:18  And the children of Yisra’ĕl
rose and went up to Bĕyth Ĕl to ask of Elohim, and they said, “Who of
us go up first to battle against the children of Binyamin?” And יהוה
said, “Yehuḏah first.” 
Judges
20:19  And the children of Yisra’ĕl
rose in the morning and encamped against Giḇ‛ah. 
Judges
20:20  And the men of Yisra’ĕl went
out to battle against Binyamin, and the men of Yisra’ĕl put themselves in
battle array to fight against them at Giḇ‛ah. 
Judges
20:21  And the children of Binyamin came
out of Giḇ‛ah, and on that day cut down to the ground twenty-two
thousand men of the Yisra’ĕlites. 
Judges
20:22  But the people, the men of Yisra’ĕl,
strengthened themselves and again formed the battle line at the place where
they had put themselves in array on the first day. 
Judges
20:23  And the children of Yisra’ĕl
went up and wept before יהוה until evening, and asked
of יהוה, saying, “Should I again draw near for battle
against the children of my brother Binyamin?” And יהוה
said, “Go up against him.” 
Judges
20:24  And the children of Yisra’ĕl
drew near to the children of Binyamin on the second day. 
Judges
20:25  And Binyamin went out against them
from Giḇ‛ah on the second day, and cut down to the ground eighteen
thousand more of the children of Yisra’ĕl – all these drew the sword. 
Judges
20:26  And all the children of Yisra’ĕl,
even all the people, went up and came to Bĕyth Ĕl and wept, and sat
there before יהוה and fasted that day until evening.
And they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before יהוה.

Judges
20:27  And the children of Yisra’ĕl
asked of יהוה – the ark of the covenant of Elohim was
there in those days, 
Judges
20:28  and Pineḥas son of El‛azar,
son of Aharon, stood before it in those days – saying, “Should I yet again go
out to battle against the children of my brother Binyamin, or should I cease?”
And יהוה said, “Go up, for tomorrow I give them into
your hand.” 
Judges
20:29  And Yisra’ĕl set ambushers
all around Giḇ‛ah. 
Judges
20:30  And the children of Yisra’ĕl
went up against the children of Binyamin on the third day, and put themselves
in battle array against Giḇ‛ah as at the other times. 
Judges
20:31  And the children of Binyamin came
out to meet the people – drawn away from the city. And they began to smite some
of the people, slaying, as at the other times, in the highways, of which one
went up to Bĕyth Ĕl and the other to Giḇ‛ah in the field,
about thirty men of Yisra’ĕl. 
Judges
20:32  And the children of Binyamin said,
“They are going to be smitten before us, as previously.” But the children of
Yisra’ĕl said, “Let us flee and draw them away from the city to the
highways.” 
Judges
20:33  And all the men of Yisra’ĕl
rose from their place and put themselves in battle array at Ba‛al Tamar.
And the ambush of Yisra’ĕl broke forth from their position at Ma‛areh
Ìeḇa. 
Judges
20:34  And ten thousand chosen men from
all Yisra’ĕl came against Giḇ‛ah, and the battle was fierce.
But they did not know that calamity was close to them. 
Judges
20:35  And יהוה
smote Binyamin before Yisra’ĕl. And the children of Yisra’ĕl
destroyed twenty-five thousand one hundred men on that day in Binyamin – all
these drew the sword. 
Judges
20:36  And the children of Binyamin saw
that they were smitten. And the men of Yisra’ĕl had given ground to the
Binyamites, because they trusted in the ambush that they had set against Giḇ‛ah,

Judges
20:37  and the ambush hurried and came
against Giḇ‛ah, and the ambush spread out and smote the entire city
with the edge of the sword. 
Judges
20:38  And the appointed signal between
the men of Yisra’ĕl and the ambush was that they would make a great cloud
of smoke rise up from the city, 
Judges
20:39  then the men of Yisra’ĕl
would turn in battle, and Binyamin began to smite dead about thirty of the men
of Yisra’ĕl. For they said, “They are indeed smitten before us, as at the
first battle.” 
Judges
20:40  Then the cloud began to rise from
the city in a column of smoke, and the Binyamites looked behind them, and saw
the entire city going up in smoke to the heavens. 
Judges
20:41  And when the men of Yisra’ĕl
turned back, the men of Binyamin were troubled, for they saw that calamity was
close to them. 
Judges
20:42  And they turned their backs before
the men of Yisra’ĕl toward the way of the wilderness, but the battle
overtook them, while those who had come out of the cities were destroying them
in their midst. 
Judges
20:43  They surrounded the Binyamites and
pursued them, and with ease trampled them down as far as the front of Giḇ‛ah
toward the east. 
Judges
20:44  And there fell of Binyamin
eighteen thousand men – all of these were mighty men. 
Judges
20:45  And they turned and fled toward
the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon. And they cut down five thousand of them
on the highways, and followed after them up to Giḏom, and smote two
thousand of them. 
Judges
20:46  And all who fell of Binyamin that
day were twenty-five thousand men who drew the sword, all of these were mighty
men. 
Judges
20:47  But six hundred men turned and
fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, and they dwelt at the rock of
Rimmon for four months. 
Judges
20:48  And the men of Yisra’ĕl
turned back against the children of Binyamin, and smote them with the edge of
the sword from every city, men and beasts, all who were found. And they set
fire to all the cities they came to. 
Judges
21:1  And the men of Yisra’ĕl had
sworn an oath at Mitspah, saying, “Not one of us shall give his daughter to
Binyamin as a wife.” 
Judges
21:2  So the people came to Bĕyth Ĕl,
and sat there until evening before Elohim, and lifted up their voices and wept
bitterly, 
Judges
21:3  and said, “O יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, why has this come about in Yisra’ĕl, that today
there should be one tribe missing in Yisra’ĕl?” 
Judges
21:4  And it came to be on the morrow,
that the people rose early and built an altar there, and brought burnt
offerings and peace offerings. 
Judges
21:5  And the children of Yisra’ĕl
said, “Who is there among all the tribes of Yisra’ĕl who did not come up
with the assembly to יהוה ?” For they had made a great
oath concerning anyone who had not come up to יהוה at
Mitspah, saying, “He shall certainly be put to death.” 
Judges
21:6  And the children of Yisra’ĕl
were sorry for Binyamin their brother, and said, “One tribe is cut off from
Yisra’ĕl today. 
Judges
21:7  “What do we do for wives for those
who remain, seeing we have sworn by יהוה not to give
them our daughters as wives?” 
Judges
21:8  And they said, “Which one of the
tribes of Yisra’ĕl did not come up to Mitspah to יהוה
?” And see, no one had come to the camp from Yaḇĕsh Gil‛aḏ
to the assembly. 
Judges
21:9  For when the people called a roll,
see, not one of the inhabitants of Yaḇĕsh Gil‛aḏ was
there. 
Judges
21:10  And the congregation sent out
there twelve thousand of their bravest men, and commanded them, saying, “Go,
and you shall smite the inhabitants of Yaḇĕsh Gil‛aḏ
with the edge of the sword, even the women and children. 
Judges
21:11  “And this is what you do: Put
under the ban every male, and every woman who has known a man by lying with
him.” 
Judges
21:12  And they found among the
inhabitants of Yaḇĕsh Gil‛aḏ four hundred young maidens
who had not known a man. And they brought them to the camp at Shiloh, which is
in the land of Kena‛an. 
Judges
21:13  Then all the congregation sent,
and spoke to the children of Binyamin who were at the rock of Rimmon, and
proclaimed peace to them. 
Judges
21:14  And Binyamin turned back at that
time, and they gave them the women whom they had saved alive of the women of Yaḇĕsh
Gil‛aḏ. But even so there were not enough for them. 
Judges
21:15  And the people were sorry for
Binyamin, because יהוה had made a breach in the tribes
of Yisra’ĕl. 
Judges
21:16  And the elders of the congregation
said, “What do we do for wives for those who remain, since the women have been
destroyed out of Binyamin?” 
Judges
21:17  And they said, “There is an inheritance
for the survivors of Binyamin, and no tribe is to be destroyed from Yisra’ĕl.

Judges
21:18  “But we are unable to give them
wives from our daughters, for the children of Yisra’ĕl have sworn an oath,
saying, ‘Cursed be the one who gives a wife to Binyamin.’ ” 
Judges
21:19  So they said, “See, there is a
yearly festival of יהוה in Shiloh, which is north of Bĕyth
Ĕl, on the east side of the highway that goes up from Bĕyth Ĕl
to Sheḵem, and south of Leḇonah.” 
Judges
21:20  And they commanded the children of
Binyamin, saying, “Go, lie in wait in the vineyards, 
Judges
21:21  “and watch. And see, when the
daughters of Shiloh come out to perform their dances, then you shall come out
from the vineyards, and every man catch a wife for himself from the daughters
of Shiloh, and go to the land of Binyamin. 
Judges
21:22  “And it shall be, when their
fathers or their brothers come to us to complain, that we shall say to them, ‘Favour
us with them, because we did not take a wife for any of them in battle, neither
have you given them to them, making yourselves guilty of your oath.’ ” 
Judges
21:23  And the children of Binyamin did
so, and took enough wives for their number from those who danced, whom they
caught. Then they went and returned to their inheritance, and they rebuilt the
cities and dwelt in them. 
Judges
21:24  And the children of Yisra’ĕl
went from there at that time, each one to his tribe and clan. And they went
from there, each one to his inheritance. 
Judges
21:25  In those days there was no
sovereign in Yisra’ĕl – everyone did what was right in his own eyes.
