Mattithyahu/Matthew
Mat
1:1  The book of the genealogy of יהושע
Messiah, Son of Dawiḏ, Son of Aḇraham: 
Mat
1:2  Aḇraham brought forth
Yitsḥaq, and Yitsḥaq brought forth Ya‛aqoḇ, and Ya‛aqoḇ
brought forth Yehuḏah and his brothers. 
Mat
1:3  And Yehuḏah brought forth
Perets and Zeraḥ by Tamar, and Perets brought forth Ḥetsron, and Ḥetsron
brought forth Ram. 
Mat
1:4  And Ram brought forth Amminaḏaḇ,
and Amminaḏaḇ brought forth Naḥshon, and Naḥshon
brought forth Salmon. 
Mat
1:5  And Salmon brought forth Bo‛az
by Raḥaḇ, and Bo‛az brought forth Oḇĕḏ by
Ruth, and Oḇĕḏ brought forth Yishai. 
Mat
1:6  And Yishai brought forth Dawiḏ
the sovereign, and Dawiḏ the sovereign brought forth Shelomoh by Uriyah’s
wife. 
Mat
1:7  And Shelomoh brought forth
Reḥaḇ‛am, and Reḥaḇ‛am brought forth Aḇiyah,
and Aḇiyah brought forth Asa.
Mat
1:8  And Asa brought forth Yehoshaphat,
and Yehoshaphat brought forth Yoram, and Yoram brought forth Uzziyah. 
Mat
1:9  And Uzziyah brought forth Yotham,
and Yotham brought forth Aḥaz, and Aḥaz brought forth Ḥizqiyahu.

Mat
1:10  And Ḥizqiyahu brought forth
Menashsheh, and Menashsheh brought forth Amon, and Amon brought forth
Yoshiyahu. 
Mat
1:11  And Yoshiyahu brought forth Yeḵonyah
and his brothers at the time of the exile to Baḇel. 
Mat
1:12  And after the exile to Baḇel,
Yeḵonyah brought forth She’alti’ĕl, and She’alti’ĕl brought
forth Zerubbaḇel. 
Mat
1:13  And Zerubbaḇel brought forth
Aḇihuḏ, and Aḇihuḏ brought forth Elyaqim, and Elyaqim
brought forth Azor. 
Mat
1:14  And Azor brought forth Tsaḏoq,
and Tsaḏoq brought forth Aqim, and Aqim brought forth Elihuḏ. 
Mat
1:15  And Elihuḏ brought forth El‛azar,
and El‛azar brought forth Mattan, and Mattan brought forth Ya‛aqoḇ.

Mat
1:16  And Ya‛aqoḇ brought
forth Yosĕph the husband of Miryam, of whom was born יהושע
who is called Messiah. 
Mat
1:17  So all the generations from Aḇraham
to Dawiḏ were fourteen generations, and from Dawiḏ until the exile
to Baḇel were fourteen generations, and from the exile to Baḇel
until the Messiah were fourteen generations. 
Mat
1:18  But the birth of יהושע
Messiah was as follows: After His mother Miryam was engaged to Yosĕph,
before they came together, she was found to be pregnant from the Set-apart
Spirit. 
Mat
1:19  And Yosĕph her husband, being
righteous, and not wishing to make a show of her, had in mind to put her away
secretly. 
Mat
1:20  But while he thought about this,
see, a messenger of יהוה appeared to him in a dream,
saying, “Yosĕph, son of Dawiḏ, do not be afraid to take Miryam as
your wife, for that which is in her was brought forth from the Set-apart
Spirit. 
Mat
1:21  “And she shall give birth to a Son,
and you shall call His Name יהושע for He shall
save His people from their sins.”
Mat
1:22  And all this came to be in order to
fill what was spoken by יהוה through the prophet,
saying, 
Mat
1:23  “See, a maiden shall conceive, and
she shall give birth to a Son, and they shall call His Name Immanu’ĕl,”
which translated, means, “Ĕl with us.” 
Mat
1:24  And Yosĕph, awaking from his
sleep, did as the messenger of יהוה commanded him and
took his wife, 
Mat
1:25  but knew her not until she gave
birth to her Son, the first-born. And he called His Name יהושע.

Mat
2:1  And יהושע
having been born in Bĕyth Leḥem of Yehuḏah in the days of
Herodes the sovereign, see, Magi from the East came to Yerushalayim, 
Mat
2:2  saying, “Where is He who has been
born Sovereign of the Yehuḏim? For we saw His star in the East and have
come to do reverence to Him.” 
Mat
2:3  And Herodes the sovereign, having
heard, was troubled, and all Yerushalayim with him. 
Mat
2:4  And having gathered all the chief
priests and scribes of the people together, he asked them where the Messiah was
to be born. 
Mat
2:5  And they said to him, “In Bĕyth
Leḥem of Yehuḏah, for thus it has been written by the prophet, 
Mat
2:6  ‘But you, Bĕyth Leḥem, in
the land of Yehuḏah, you are by no means least among the rulers of Yehuḏah,
for out of you shall come a Ruler who shall shepherd My people Yisra’ĕl.’ ”
Mat
2:7  Then Herodes, having called the Magi
secretly, learned exactly from them what time the star appeared. 
Mat
2:8  And having sent them to Bĕyth
Leḥem, he said, “Go and search diligently for the Child, and when you have
found Him, bring back word to me, so that I too might go and do reverence to
Him.” 
Mat
2:9  And having heard the sovereign, they
went. And see, the star which they had seen in the East went before them, until
it came and stood over where the Child was. 
Mat
2:10  And seeing the star, they rejoiced
with exceedingly great joy. 
Mat
2:11  And coming into the house, they saw
the Child with Miryam His mother, and fell down and did reverence to Him, and
opening their treasures, they presented to Him gifts of gold, and frankincense,
and myrrh. 
Mat
2:12  And having been warned in a dream
that they should not return to Herodes, they departed for their own country by
another way. 
Mat
2:13  And when they had left, see, a
messenger of יהוה appeared to Yosĕph in a dream,
saying, “Arise, take the Child and His mother, and flee to Mitsrayim, and
remain there until I bring you word, for Herodes is about to seek the Child to
destroy Him.” 
Mat
2:14  And rising up, he took the Child
and His mother by night and departed for Mitsrayim, 
Mat
2:15  and remained there until the death
of Herodes, to fill what was spoken by יהוה through the
prophet, saying, “Out of Mitsrayim I have called My Son.”
Mat
2:16  Then Herodes, having seen that he
was fooled by the Magi, was greatly enraged, and he sent forth and slew all the
male children in Bĕyth Leḥem and in all its borders, from two years
old and under, according to the time which he had exactly learnt from the Magi.

Mat
2:17  Then was filled what was spoken by
Yirmeyahu the prophet, saying, 
Mat
2:18  “A voice was heard in Ramah,
wailing and weeping, and great mourning – Raḥĕl weeping for her
children, refusing to be comforted, because they were no more.” 
Mat
2:19  And Herodes having died, see, a
messenger of יהוה appeared in a dream to Yosĕph in
Mitsrayim, 
Mat
2:20  saying, “Arise, and take the Child and His mother, and
go into the land of Yisra’ĕl, for those seeking the life of the Child are
dead.”
Mat
2:21  And rising up, he took the Child
and His mother, and came into the land of Yisra’ĕl. 
Mat
2:22  But hearing that Archelaos was
reigning over Yehuḏah instead of his father Herodes, he was afraid to go
there. And having been warned in a dream, he departed to the parts of Galil, 
Mat
2:23  and came and dwelt in a city called
Natsareth – thus to fill what was spoken by the prophets, “He shall be called a
Natsarene.” 
Mat
3:1  And in those days Yoḥanan the
Immerser came proclaiming in the wilderness of Yehuḏah, 
Mat
3:2  and saying, “Repent, for the reign
of the heavens has come near!” 
Mat
3:3  For this is he who was spoken of by
the prophet Yeshayahu, saying, “A voice of one crying in the wilderness, ‘Prepare
the way of יהוה, make His paths straight.’ ”
Mat
3:4  And Yoḥanan had a garment of
camel’s hair, and a leather girdle around his waist. And his food was locusts
and wild honey. 
Mat
3:5  Then Yerushalayim, and all Yehuḏah,
and all the country around the Yardĕn went out to him, 
Mat
3:6  and they were immersed by him in the
Yardĕn, confessing their sins. 
Mat
3:7  And seeing many of the Pharisees and
Sadducees coming to his immersion, he said to them, “Brood of adders! Who has
warned you to flee from the coming wrath? 
Mat
3:8  “Bear, therefore, fruits worthy of
repentance, 
Mat
3:9  and do not think to say to yourselves,
‘We have Aḇraham as father.’ For I say to you that Elohim is able to
raise up children to Aḇraham from these stones.
Mat
3:10  “And the axe is already laid to the
root of the trees. Every tree, then, which does not bear good fruit is cut down
and thrown into the fire. 
Mat
3:11  “I indeed immerse you in water unto
repentance, but He who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I
am not worthy to bear. He shall immerse you in the Set-apart Spirit and fire. 
Mat
3:12  “His winnowing fork is in His hand,
and He shall thoroughly cleanse His threshing-floor, and gather His wheat into
the storehouse, but the chaff He shall burn with unquenchable fire.” 
Mat
3:13  Then יהושע
came from Galil to Yoḥanan at the Yardĕn to be immersed by him. 
Mat
3:14  But Yoḥanan was hindering
Him, saying, “I need to be immersed by You, and You come to me?” 
Mat
3:15  But יהושע
answering, said to him, “Permit it now, for thus it is fitting for us to fill
all righteousness.” Then he permitted Him. 
Mat
3:16  And having been immersed, יהושע
went up immediately from the water, and see, the heavens were opened, and He
saw the Spirit of Elohim descending like a dove and coming upon Him, 
Mat
3:17  and see, a voice out of the
heavens, saying, “This is My Son, the Beloved, in whom I did delight.” 
Mat
4:1  Then יהושע
was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tried by the devil. 
Mat
4:2  And after having fasted forty days
and forty nights, He was hungry. 
Mat
4:3  And the trier came and said to Him, “If
You are the Son of Elohim, command that these stones become bread.” 
Mat
4:4  But He answering, said, “It has been
written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from
the mouth of יהוה.’ ”
Mat
4:5  Then the devil took Him up into the
set-apart city, set Him on the edge of the Set-apart Place, 
Mat
4:6  and said to Him, “If You are the Son
of Elohim, throw Yourself down. For it has been written, ‘He shall command His
messengers concerning you,’ and, ‘In their hands they shall bear you up, so that
you do not dash your foot against a stone.’ ” 
Mat
4:7  יהושע
said to him, “It has also been written, ‘You shall not try יהוה
your Elohim.’ ”
Mat
4:8  Again, the devil took Him up on a
very high mountain, and showed Him all the reigns of the world, and their
esteem, 
Mat
4:9  and said to Him, “All these I shall
give You if You fall down and worship me.” 
Mat
4:10  Then יהושע
said to him, “Go, Satan! For it has been written, ‘You shall worship יהוה
your Elohim, and Him alone you shall serve.’ ”
Mat
4:11  Then the devil left Him, and see,
messengers came and attended Him. 
Mat
4:12  And יהושע,
having heard that Yoḥanan had been put in prison, withdrew into Galil. 
Mat
4:13  And leaving Natsareth, He came and
dwelt in Kephar Naḥum, which is by the sea, in the borders of Zeḇulun
and Naphtali, 
Mat
4:14  to fill what was spoken by
Yeshayahu the prophet, saying, 
Mat
4:15  “Land of Zeḇulun and land of
Naphtali, the way of the sea, beyond the Yardĕn, Galil of the gentiles – 
Mat
4:16  the people who sat in darkness saw
a great light, and upon those who sat in the land and shadow of death, light
arose to them.”
Mat
4:17  From that time יהושע
began to proclaim and to say, “Repent, for the reign of the heavens has drawn
near.” 
Mat
4:18  And יהושע,
walking by the Sea of Galil, saw two brothers, Shim‛on called Kĕpha,
and Andri his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen. 
Mat
4:19  And He said to them, “Follow Me,
and I shall make you fishers of men.” 
Mat
4:20  And immediately they left their
nets and followed Him. 
Mat
4:21  And going on from there, He saw two
other brothers, Ya‛aqoḇ the
son of Zaḇdai, and Yoḥanan his brother, in the boat with Zaḇdai
their father, mending their nets. And He called them, 
Mat
4:22  and immediately they left the boat
and their father, and followed Him. 
Mat
4:23  And יהושע
went about all Galil, teaching in their congregations, and proclaiming the Good
News of the reign, and healing every disease and every bodily weakness among
the people. 
Mat
4:24  And news about Him went out into
all Syria. And they brought to Him all who were sick, afflicted with various
diseases and pains, and those who were demon-possessed, and epileptics, and
paralytics. And He healed them. 
Mat
4:25  And large crowds – from Galil, and
Dekapolis, and Yerushalayim, and Yehuḏah, and beyond the Yardĕn –
followed Him. 
Mat
5:1  But when He saw the crowds, He went
up on a mountain. And when He was seated His taught ones came to Him. 
Mat
5:2  And having opened His mouth, He was
teaching them, saying, 
Mat
5:3  “Blessed are the poor in spirit,
because theirs is the reign of the heavens. 
Mat
5:4  “Blessed are those who mourn,
because they shall be comforted. 
Mat
5:5  “Blessed are the meek, because they
shall inherit the earth.
Mat
5:6  “Blessed are those who hunger and
thirst for righteousness, because they shall be filled.
Mat
5:7  “Blessed are the compassionate,
because they shall obtain compassion. 
Mat
5:8  “Blessed are the clean in heart,
because they shall see Elohim.
Mat
5:9  “Blessed are the peacemakers,
because they shall be called sons of Elohim. 
Mat
5:10  “Blessed are those persecuted for
righteousness’ sake, because theirs is the reign of the heavens.
Mat
5:11  “Blessed are you when they reproach
and persecute you, and falsely say every wicked word against you, for My sake. 
Mat
5:12  “Rejoice and be glad, because your
reward in the heavens is great. For in this way they persecuted the prophets
who were before you. 
Mat
5:13  “You are the salt of the earth, but
if the salt becomes tasteless, how shall it be seasoned? For it is no longer of
any use but to be thrown out and to be trodden down by men. 
Mat
5:14  “You are the light of the world. It
is impossible for a city to be hidden on a mountain. 
Mat
5:15  “Nor do they light a lamp and put
it under a basket, but on a lampstand, and it shines to all those in the house.

Mat
5:16  “Let your light so shine before
men, so that they see your good works and praise your Father who is in the
heavens. 
Mat
5:17  “Do not think that I came to
destroy the Torah or the Prophets. I did not come to destroy but to complete.
Mat
5:18  “For truly, I say to you, till the
heaven and the earth pass away, one jot or one tittle shall by no means pass
from the Torah till all be done.
Mat
5:19  “Whoever, then, breaks one of the
least of these commands, and teaches men so, shall be called least in the reign
of the heavens; but whoever does and teaches them, he shall be called great in
the reign of the heavens. 
Mat
5:20  “For I say to you, that unless your
righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall by no means
enter into the reign of the heavens.
Mat
5:21  “You heard that it was said to
those of old, ‘You shall not murder,’ and whoever murders shall be liable to
judgment. 
Mat
5:22  “But I say to you that whoever is
wroth with his brother without a cause shall be liable to judgment. And whoever
says to his brother, ‘Raka!’ shall be liable to the Sanhedrin. But whoever
says, ‘You fool!’ shall be liable to fire of Gehenna. 
Mat
5:23  “If, then, you bring your gift to
the altar, and there remember that your brother holds whatever against you, 
Mat
5:24  leave your gift there before the
altar, and go, first make peace with your brother, and then come and offer your
gift. 
Mat
5:25  “Be well-minded with your opponent,
promptly, while you are on the way with him, lest your opponent deliver you to
the judge, and the judge to the officer, and you be thrown into prison. 
Mat
5:26  “Truly, I say to you, you shall by
no means get out of there till you have paid the last penny. 
Mat
5:27  “You heard that it was said to
those of old, ‘You shall not commit adultery.’ 
Mat
5:28  “But I say to you that everyone
looking at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in
his heart. 
Mat
5:29  “And if your right eye causes you
to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away from you. For it is better for you
that one of your members perish, than for your entire body to be thrown into
Gehenna. 
Mat
5:30  “And if your right hand causes you
to stumble, cut it off and throw it away from you. For it is better for you
that one of your members perish, than for your entire body to be thrown into
Gehenna. 
Mat
5:31  “And it has been said, ‘Whoever
puts away his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce.’ 
Mat
5:32  “But I say to you that whoever puts
away his wife, except for the matter of whoring, makes her commit adultery. And
whoever marries a woman who has been put away commits adultery.
Mat
5:33  “Again, you heard that it was said to
those of old, ‘You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform your oaths to יהוה.’

Mat
5:34  “But I say to you, do not swear at
all, neither by the heaven, because it is Elohim’s throne; 
Mat
5:35  nor by the earth, for it is His
footstool; nor by Yerushalayim, for it is the city of the great Sovereign; 
Mat
5:36  nor swear by your head, because you
are not able to make one hair white or black. 
Mat
5:37  “But let your word ‘Yea’ be ‘Yea,’
and your ‘No’ be ‘No.’ And what goes beyond these is from the wicked one. 
Mat
5:38  “You heard that it was said, ‘An
eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth,’ 
Mat
5:39  but I say to you, do not resist the
wicked. But whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other to him also. 
Mat
5:40  “And he who wishes to sue you and
take away your inner garment, let him have your outer garment as well. 
Mat
5:41  “And whoever compels you to go one
mile, go with him two. 
Mat
5:42  “Give to him who asks of you, and
from him who wishes to borrow from you, do not turn away. 
Mat
5:43  “You heard that it was said, ‘You
shall love your neighbour and hate your enemy.’
Mat
5:44  “But I say to you, love your
enemies, bless those cursing you, do good to those hating you, and pray for
those insulting you and persecuting you, 
Mat
5:45  so that you become sons of your
Father in the heavens. Because He makes His sun rise on the wicked and on the
good, and sends rain on the righteous and on the unrighteous.
Mat
5:46  “For if you love those loving you,
what reward have you? Are the tax collectors not doing the same too? 
Mat
5:47  “And if you greet your brothers
only, what do you do more than others?
Are the tax collectors not doing so too? 
Mat
5:48  “Therefore, be perfect, as your
Father in the heavens is perfect.
Mat
6:1  “Beware of doing your kind deeds
before men, in order to be seen by them. Otherwise you have no reward from your
Father in the heavens. 
Mat
6:2  “Thus, when you do a kind deed, do
not sound a trumpet before you as the hypocrites do, in the congregations and
in the streets, to be praised by men. Truly, I say to you, they have their
reward. 
Mat
6:3  “But when you do a kind deed, do not
let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, 
Mat
6:4  so that your kind deed shall be in
secret. And your Father who sees in secret shall Himself reward you openly. 
Mat
6:5  “And when you pray, you shall not be
like the hypocrites. For they love to pray standing in the congregations and on
the corners of the streets, to be seen by men. Truly, I say to you, they have
their reward. 
Mat
6:6  “But you, when you pray, go into
your room, and having shut your door, pray to your Father who is in the secret
place. And your Father who sees in secret shall reward you openly. 
Mat
6:7  “And when praying, do not keep on
babbling like the gentiles. For they think that they shall be heard for their
many words.
Mat
6:8  “Therefore do not be like them, for
your Father knows what you need before you ask Him. 
Mat
6:9  “This, then, is the way you should
pray: ‘Our Father who is in the heavens, let Your Name be set-apart, 
Mat
6:10  let Your reign come, let Your
desire be done on earth as it is in heaven. 
Mat
6:11  ‘Give us today our daily bread. 
Mat
6:12  ‘And forgive us our debts, as we
forgive our debtors. 
Mat
6:13  ‘And do not lead us into trial, but
deliver us from the wicked one – because Yours is the reign and the power and
the esteem, forever. Amĕn.’
Mat
6:14  “For if you forgive men their
trespasses, your heavenly Father shall also forgive you. 
Mat
6:15  “But if you do not forgive men
their trespasses, neither shall your Father forgive your trespasses. 
Mat
6:16  “And when you fast, do not be
sad-faced like the hypocrites. For they disfigure their faces so that they
appear to be fasting to men. Truly, I say to you, they have their reward. 
Mat
6:17  “But you, when you fast, anoint
your head and wash your face, 
Mat
6:18  so that you do not appear to men to
be fasting, but to your Father who is in the secret place. And your Father who
sees in secret shall reward you openly. 
Mat
6:19  “Do not lay up for yourselves
treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and
steal, 
Mat
6:20  but lay up for yourselves treasures
in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break
in and steal. 
Mat
6:21  “For where your treasure is, there
your heart shall be also. 
Mat
6:22  “The lamp of the body is the eye.
If therefore your eye is good, all your body shall be enlightened. 
Mat
6:23  “But if your eye is evil, all your
body shall be darkened. If, then, the light that is within you is darkness, how
great is that darkness!
Mat
6:24  “No one is able to serve two
masters, for either he shall hate the one and love the other, or else he shall
cleave to the one and despise the other. You are not able to serve Elohim and
mammon.
Mat
6:25  “Because of this I say to you, do
not worry about your life, what you shall eat or drink, or about your body,
what you shall put on. Is not life more than the food and the body more than
the clothing? 
Mat
6:26  “Look at the birds of the heaven,
for they neither sow nor reap nor gather into storehouses, yet your heavenly
Father does feed them. Are you not worth more than they? 
Mat
6:27  “And which of you by worrying is
able to add one cubit to his life’s span? 
Mat
6:28  “So why do you worry about
clothing? Note well the lilies of the field, how they grow. They neither toil
nor spin, 
Mat
6:29  and I say to you that even Shelomoh
in all his esteem was not dressed like one of these. 
Mat
6:30  “But if Elohim so clothes the grass
of the field, which exists today, and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace, how
much more you, O you of little belief? 
Mat
6:31  “Do not worry then, saying, ‘What
shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ 
Mat
6:32  “For all these the gentiles seek
for. And your heavenly Father knows that you need all these. 
Mat
6:33  “But seek first the reign of
Elohim, and His righteousness, and all these matters shall be added to you. 
Mat
6:34  “Do not, then, worry about
tomorrow, for tomorrow shall have its own worries. Each day has enough evil of
itself. 
Mat
7:1  “Do not judge, lest you be judged.
Mat
7:2  “For with what judgment you judge,
you shall be judged. And with the same measure you use, it shall be measured to
you. 
Mat
7:3  “And why do you look at the splinter
in your brother’s eye, but do not notice the plank in your own eye? 
Mat
7:4  “Or how is it that you say to your
brother, ‘Let me remove the splinter out of your eye,’ and see, a plank is in
your own eye? 
Mat
7:5  “Hypocrite! First remove the plank
from your own eye, and then you shall see clearly to remove the splinter out of
your brother’s eye. 
Mat
7:6  “Do not give what is set-apart to
the dogs, nor throw your pearls before the pigs, lest they trample them under
their feet, and turn and tear you in pieces. 
Mat
7:7  “Ask and it shall be given to you,
seek and you shall find, knock and it shall be opened to you. 
Mat
7:8  “For everyone who asks receives, and
he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it shall be opened. 
Mat
7:9  “Or is there a man among you who, if
his son asks for bread, shall give him a stone? 
Mat
7:10  “Or if he asks for a fish, shall he
give him a snake? 
Mat
7:11  “If you then, being wicked, know
how to give good gifts to your children, how much more shall your Father who is
in the heavens give what is good to those who ask Him! 
Mat
7:12  “Therefore, whatever you wish men
to do to you, do also to them, for this is the Torah and the Prophets. 
Mat
7:13  “Enter in through the narrow gate!
Because the gate is wide – and the way is broad – that leads to destruction,
and there are many who enter in through it. 
Mat
7:14  “Because the gate is narrow and the
way is hard pressed which leads to life, and there are few who find it.
Mat
7:15  “But beware of the false prophets,
who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are savage wolves.
Mat
7:16  “By their fruits you shall know
them. Are grapes gathered from thornbushes or figs from thistles? 
Mat
7:17  “So every good tree yields good
fruit, but a rotten tree yields wicked fruit. 
Mat
7:18  “A good tree is unable to yield
wicked fruit, and a rotten tree to yield good fruit. 
Mat
7:19  “Every tree that does not bear good
fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. 
Mat
7:20  “So then, by their fruits you shall
know them – 
Mat
7:21  “Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Master,
Master,’ shall enter into the reign of the heavens, but he who is doing the
desire of My Father in the heavens. 
Mat
7:22  “Many shall say to Me in that day, ‘Master,
Master, have we not prophesied in Your Name, and cast out demons in Your Name,
and done many mighty works in Your Name?’ 
Mat
7:23  “And then I shall declare to them, ‘I
never knew you, depart from Me, you who work lawlessness!’
Mat
7:24  “Therefore everyone who hears these
words of Mine, and does them, shall be like a wise man who built his house on
the rock, 
Mat
7:25  and the rain came down, and the
floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, and it did not fall,
for it was founded on the rock. 
Mat
7:26  “And everyone who hears these words
of Mine, and does not do them, shall be like a foolish man who built his house
on the sand,
Mat
7:27  and the rain came down, and the
floods came, and the winds blew, and they beat on that house, and it fell, and
great was its fall.” 
Mat
7:28  And it came to be, when יהושע
had ended these words, that the people were astonished at His teaching, 
Mat
7:29  for He was teaching them as one
possessing authority, and not as the scribes. 
Mat
8:1  And when He came down from the
mountain, large crowds followed Him. 
Mat
8:2  And see, a leper came, and bowed
before Him, saying, “Master, if You desire, You are able to make me clean.” 
Mat
8:3  And stretching out His hand יהושע
touched him, saying, “I desire it. Be cleansed!” And immediately his leprosy
was cleansed. 
Mat
8:4  And יהושע
said to him, “See, mention it to no one. But go your way, show yourself to the
priest, and offer the gift that Mosheh commanded, as a witness to them.” 
Mat
8:5  And when יהושע
had entered Kephar Naḥum, a captain came to Him, appealing to Him, 
Mat
8:6  saying, “Master, my servant is lying
in the house paralysed, grievously tortured.” 
Mat
8:7  And יהושע
said to him, “I shall come and heal him.” 
Mat
8:8  And the captain answering, said, “Master,
I am not worthy that You should come under my roof. But only say a word, and my
servant shall be healed. 
Mat
8:9  “For I too am a man under authority,
having soldiers under me. And I say to this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes, and to
another, ‘Come,’ and he comes, and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.” 
Mat
8:10  And when יהושע
heard, He marvelled, and said to those who followed, “Truly, I say to you, not
even in Yisra’ĕl have I found such great belief! 
Mat
8:11  “And I say to you that many shall
come from east and west, and sit down with Aḇraham, and Yitsḥaq,
and Ya‛aqoḇ in the reign of the heavens, 
Mat
8:12  but the sons of the reign shall be
cast out into outer darkness – there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” 
Mat
8:13  And יהושע
said to the captain, “Go, and as you have believed, so let it be done for you.”
And his servant was healed that hour. 
Mat
8:14  And when יהושע
had come into the house of Kĕpha, He saw his wife’s mother lying sick with
inflammation. 
Mat
8:15  And He touched her hand, and the
inflammation left her. And she arose and served them. 
Mat
8:16  And when evening had come, they
brought to Him many who were demon-possessed. And He cast out the spirits with
a word, and healed all who were sick, 
Mat
8:17  that it might be filled what was
spoken by Yeshayahu the prophet, saying, “He Himself took our weaknesses and
bore our sicknesses.” 
Mat
8:18  And when יהושע
saw large crowds about Him, He gave a command to go off to the other side. 
Mat
8:19  And a certain scribe, having come
near, said to Him, “Teacher, I shall follow You wherever You go.” 
Mat
8:20  And יהושע
said to him, “The foxes have holes and the birds of the heaven nests, but the
Son of Aḏam has nowhere to lay His head.” 
Mat
8:21  And another of His taught ones said
to Him, “Master, first let me go and bury my father.” 
Mat
8:22  But יהושע
said to him, “Follow Me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead.” 
Mat
8:23  And when He entered into a boat,
His taught ones followed Him. 
Mat
8:24  And see, a great gale arose on the
sea, so that the boat was covered by the waves. But He was sleeping. 
Mat
8:25  And His taught ones came to Him and
woke Him up, saying, “Master, save us! We are perishing!” 
Mat
8:26  And He said to them, “Why are you
afraid, O you of little belief?” Then, having risen, He rebuked the winds and
the sea. And there was a great calm. 
Mat
8:27  And the men marvelled, saying, “What
is this, that even the winds and the sea obey Him?” 
Mat
8:28  And when He came to the other side,
to the country of the Girgashites, two demon-possessed ones met Him, coming out
of the tombs, very fierce, so that no one was able to pass that way. 
Mat
8:29  And see, they cried out, saying, “What
have we to do with You, יהושע, Son of Elohim?
Have You come here to torture us, before the appointed time?” 
Mat
8:30  And at a distance from them there
was a herd of many pigs feeding, 
Mat
8:31  and the demons begged Him, saying, “If
You cast us out, send us into the herd of pigs.” 
Mat
8:32  And He said to them, “Go.” And
they, coming out, went into the herd of pigs. And see, the entire herd of pigs
rushed down the steep place into the sea, and died in the water. 
Mat
8:33  And the herdsmen fled, and went
away into the city and reported all this, and about those possessed by demons. 
Mat
8:34  And see, all the city came out to
meet יהושע. And when they saw Him, they begged
Him to leave their borders. 
Mat
9:1  And entering into a boat, He passed
over, and came to His own city. 
Mat
9:2  And see, they were bringing to Him a
paralytic lying on a bed. And יהושע, seeing their
belief, said to the paralytic, “Take courage, son, your sins have been
forgiven.” 
Mat
9:3  And see, some of the scribes said to
themselves, “This One blasphemes!” 
Mat
9:4  And יהושע,
knowing their thoughts, said, “Why do you think wicked thoughts in your hearts? 
Mat
9:5  “For which is easier, to say, ‘Your
sins have been forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Arise and walk’? 
Mat
9:6  “But in order for you to know that
the Son of Aḏam possesses authority on earth to forgive sins...” He then
said to the paralytic, “Rise, take up your bed, and go to your house.” 
Mat
9:7  And he rose and went to his house. 
Mat
9:8  And when the crowds saw it, they
marvelled and praised Elohim who had given such authority to men. 
Mat
9:9  And as יהושע
passed on from there, He saw a man called Mattithyahu sitting at the tax
office. And He said to him, “Follow Me.” And he rose and followed Him. 
Mat
9:10  And it came to be, as יהושע
sat at the table in the house, that see, many tax collectors and sinners came
and sat down with Him and His taught ones. 
Mat
9:11  And when the Pharisees saw it, they
said to His taught ones, “Why does your Teacher eat with tax collectors and
sinners?” 
Mat
9:12  And יהושע
hearing this, said to them, “Those who are strong have no need of a physician,
but those who are sick. 
Mat
9:13  “But go and learn what this means, ‘I
desire compassion and not offering.’ For I did not come to call the righteous
to repentance, but sinners.” 
Mat
9:14  Then the taught ones of
Yoḥanan came to Him, saying, “Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but
Your taught ones do not fast?” 
Mat
9:15  And יהושע
said to them, “Are the friends of the bridegroom able to mourn as long as the
bridegroom is with them? But the days shall come when the bridegroom is taken
away from them, and then they shall fast. 
Mat
9:16  “And no one puts a piece of
unshrunk cloth on an old garment, for the patch pulls away from the garment,
and the tear is made worse. 
Mat
9:17  “Neither do they put new wine into
old wineskins, or else the wineskins burst, and the wine is spilled, and the
wineskins are ruined. But they put new wine into fresh wineskins, and both are
preserved.” 
Mat
9:18  While He was saying all this to
them, see, a ruler came and bowed down to Him, saying, “My daughter is dead by
now, but come and lay Your hand on her and she shall live.” 
Mat
9:19  And יהושע
rose and followed him, His taught ones too. 
Mat
9:20  And see, a woman who had a flow of
blood for twelve years came from behind and touched the tzitzit of His garment.
Mat
9:21  For she said to herself, “If I only
touch His garment, I shall be healed.” 
Mat
9:22  But יהושע
turned, and when He saw her He said, “Take courage, daughter, your belief has
healed you.” And the woman was healed from that hour. 
Mat
9:23  And when יהושע
came into the ruler’s house, and saw the flute players and the crowd making a
noise, 
Mat
9:24  He said to them, “Go back, for the
girl is not dead, but sleeping.” And they laughed at Him. 
Mat
9:25  But when the crowd was put outside,
He went in and took her by the hand, and the girl arose. 
Mat
9:26  And this report went out into all
that land. 
Mat
9:27  And as יהושע
passed on from there, two blind men followed Him, crying out and saying, “Son
of Dawiḏ, have compassion on us!” 
Mat
9:28  And when He came into the house,
the blind men came to Him. And יהושע said to
them, “Do you believe that I am able to do this?” They said to Him, “Yea,
Master.” 
Mat
9:29  Then He touched their eyes, saying,
“According to your belief let it be to you.” 
Mat
9:30  And their eyes were opened. And יהושע
strictly ordered them, saying, “See, let no one know.” 
Mat
9:31  But when they went out, they made
Him known in all that land. 
Mat
9:32  And as they were going out, see,
they brought to Him a man, dumb and demon-possessed. 
Mat
9:33  And when the demon was cast out,
the dumb one spoke. And the crowds marvelled, saying, “It was never seen like
this in Yisra’ĕl!” 
Mat
9:34  But the Pharisees said, “He casts
out demons by the ruler of the demons.” 
Mat
9:35  And יהושע
went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their congregations, and
proclaiming the Good News of the reign, and healing every disease and every
bodily weakness among the people. 
Mat
9:36  And having seen the crowds, He was
moved with compassion for them, because they were weary and scattered, as sheep
having no shepherd. 
Mat
9:37  Then He said to His taught ones, “The
harvest truly is great, but the workers are few. 
Mat
9:38  “Pray then that the Master of the
harvest would send out workers to His harvest.” 
Mat
10:1  And having called His twelve taught
ones near, He gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and
to heal every disease and every bodily weakness. 
Mat
10:2  And these are the names of the
twelve emissaries: first, Shim‛on, who is called Kĕpha, and Andri
his brother; Ya‛aqoḇ the son
of Zaḇdai, and Yoḥanan his brother; 
Mat
10:3  Philip and Bartholomi; T’oma and
Mattithyahu the tax collector; Ya‛aqoḇ the son of Alphai, and Laḇai whose last name was Taddai; 
Mat
10:4  Shim‛on the Kena‛anite,
and Yehuḏah from Qerioth, who did also deliver Him up. 
Mat
10:5  יהושע
sent these twelve out, having commanded them, saying, “Do not go into the way
of the gentiles, and do not enter a city of the Shomeronites, 
Mat
10:6  but rather go to the lost sheep of
the house of Yisra’ĕl.
Mat
10:7  “And as you go, proclaim, saying, ‘The
reign of the heavens has drawn near.’ 
Mat
10:8  “Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers,
raise the dead, cast out demons. You have received without paying, give without
being paid. 
Mat
10:9  “Do not acquire gold or silver or
copper for your moneybelts, 
Mat
10:10  or a bag for the journey, or two
undergarments, or sandals, or staffs, for the worker is worthy of his food. 
Mat
10:11  “And into whatever city or village
you enter, ask who is worthy in it, and stay there until you leave. 
Mat
10:12  “And as you enter into a house,
greet it. 
Mat
10:13  “And if the house is worthy, let
your peace come upon it. But if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you.

Mat
10:14  “And whoever does not receive you
nor hear your words, when you leave that house or city, shake off the dust from
your feet. 
Mat
10:15  “Truly, I say to you, it shall be
more bearable for the land of Seḏom and Amorah in the day of judgment
than for that city! 
Mat
10:16  “See, I send you out as sheep in
the midst of wolves. Therefore be wise as serpents and innocent as doves. 
Mat
10:17  “But beware of men, for they shall
deliver you up to sanhedrins and flog you in their congregations. 
Mat
10:18  “And you shall be brought before
governors and sovereigns for My sake, as a witness to them and to the gentiles.

Mat
10:19  “But when they deliver you up, do
not worry about how or what you should speak. For it shall be given to you in
that hour what you shall speak, 
Mat
10:20  for it is not you who speak, but
the Spirit of your Father speaking in you. 
Mat
10:21  “And brother shall deliver up
brother to death, and a father his child. And children shall rise up against
parents and shall put them to death. 
Mat
10:22  “And you shall be hated by all for
My Name’s sake. But he who shall have endured to the end shall be saved.
Mat
10:23  “And when they persecute you in
this city, flee to another. For truly, I say to you, you shall by no means have
gone through the cities of Yisra’ĕl before the Son of Aḏam comes. 
Mat
10:24  “A taught one is not above his
teacher, nor a servant above his master. 
Mat
10:25  “It is enough for the taught one
to become like his teacher, and a servant like his master. If they have called
the master of the house Be‛elzebul, how much more those of his household!

Mat
10:26  “Therefore do not fear them. For
whatever is covered shall be revealed, and whatever is hidden shall be made
known. 
Mat
10:27  “What I say to you in the dark,
speak in the light. And what you hear in the ear, proclaim on the house-tops. 
Mat
10:28  “And do not fear those who kill
the body but are unable to kill the being. But rather fear Him who is able to
destroy both being and body in Gehenna. 
Mat
10:29  “Are not two sparrows sold for a
copper coin? And not one of them falls to the ground without your Father. 
Mat
10:30  “And even the hairs of your head
are all numbered. 
Mat
10:31  “So do not fear, you are worth
more than many sparrows. 
Mat
10:32  “Everyone, therefore, who shall
confess Me before men, him I shall also confess before My Father who is in the
heavens. 
Mat
10:33  “But whoever shall deny Me before
men, him I shall also deny before My Father who is in the heavens. 
Mat
10:34  “Do not think that I have come to
bring peace on earth. I did not come to bring peace but a sword,
Mat
10:35  for I have come to bring division,
a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law
against her mother-in-law – 
Mat
10:36  and a man’s enemies are those of
his own household.
Mat
10:37  “He who loves father or mother more
than Me is not worthy of Me, and he who loves son or daughter more than Me is
not worthy of Me.
Mat
10:38  “And he who does not take up his
stake and follow after Me is not worthy of Me. 
Mat
10:39  “He who has found his life shall
lose it, and he that has lost his life for My sake shall find it. 
Mat
10:40  “He who receives you receives Me,
and he who receives Me receives Him who sent Me. 
Mat
10:41  “He who receives a prophet in the
name of a prophet shall receive a prophet’s reward. And he who receives a
righteous one in the name of a righteous one shall receive a righteous one’s
reward. 
Mat
10:42  “And whoever gives one of these
little ones a cup of cold water only
in the name of a taught one, truly, I say to you, he shall by no means lose his
reward.” 
Mat
11:1  And it came to be, when יהושע
ended instructing His twelve taught ones, that He set out from there to teach
and to proclaim in their cities. 
Mat
11:2  And when Yoḥanan had heard in
the prison of the works of Messiah, he sent two of his taught ones 
Mat
11:3  and said to Him, “Are You the
Coming One, or do we look for another?” 
Mat
11:4  And יהושע
answering, said to them, “Go, report to Yoḥanan what you hear and see: 
Mat
11:5  “Blind receive sight and lame walk,
lepers are cleansed and deaf hear, dead are raised up and poor are brought the
Good News. 
Mat
11:6  “And blessed is he who does not
stumble in Me.” 
Mat
11:7  And as these were going, יהושע
began to say to the crowds concerning Yoḥanan, “What did you go out into
the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind? 
Mat
11:8  “But what did you go out to see? A
man dressed in soft garments? Look,
those wearing soft garments are in the houses of sovereigns. 
Mat
11:9  “But what did you go out to see? A
prophet? Yea, I say to you, and more than a prophet. 
Mat
11:10  “For this is he of whom it was
written, ‘See, I send My messenger before Your face, who shall prepare Your way
before You.’ 
Mat
11:11  “Truly, I say to you, among those
born of women there has not risen one greater than Yoḥanan the Immerser,
yet the least one in the reign of the heavens is greater than he. 
Mat
11:12  “And from the days of
Yoḥanan the Immerser till now the reign of the heavens is violated, and
the violent seize it.
Mat
11:13  “For all the prophets and the
Torah prophesied till Yoḥanan. 
Mat
11:14  “And if you wish to accept it, he
is Ĕliyahu who was about to come. 
Mat
11:15  “He who has ears to hear, let him
hear! 
Mat
11:16  “And to what shall I compare this
generation? It is like children sitting in the market-places and calling to
their companions, 
Mat
11:17  and saying, ‘We played the flute
for you, and you did not dance; we lamented to you, and you did not beat the
breast.’ 
Mat
11:18  “For Yoḥanan came neither
eating nor drinking, and they say, ‘He has a demon.’ 
Mat
11:19  “The Son of Aḏam came eating
and drinking, and they say, ‘See, a man, a glutton and a winedrinker, a friend
of tax collectors and sinners!’ And wisdom was declared right by her works.” 
Mat
11:20  Then He began to reproach the
cities in which most of His miracles had been done, because they did not
repent: 
Mat
11:21  “Woe to you, Korazin! Woe to you,
Bĕyth Tsaiḏa! Because if the miracles which were done in you had
been done in Tsor and Tsiḏon, they would have repented long ago in
sackcloth and ashes. 
Mat
11:22  “But I say to you, it shall be
more bearable for Tsor and Tsiḏon in the day of judgment than for you. 
Mat
11:23  “And you, Kephar Naḥum, who
were exalted to the heaven, shall be brought down to the grave! Because if the
miracles which were done in you had been done in Seḏom, it would have
remained until this day. 
Mat
11:24  “But I say to you that it shall be
more bearable for the land of Seḏom in the day of judgment than for you.”

Mat
11:25  At that time יהושע
responding, said, “I thank You, Father, Master of the heavens and earth,
because You have hidden these matters
from clever and learned ones and have revealed them to babes.
Mat
11:26  “Yea, Father, because so it was
well-pleasing in Your sight. 
Mat
11:27  “All have been handed over to Me
by My Father, and no one knows the Son except the Father. Nor does anyone know
the Father except the Son, and he to whom the Son wishes to reveal Him. 
Mat
11:28  “Come to Me, all you who labour
and are burdened, and I shall give you rest. 
Mat
11:29  “Take My yoke upon you and learn
from Me, for I am meek and humble in heart, and you shall find rest for your
beings.
Mat
11:30  “For My yoke is gentle and My
burden is light.” 
Mat
12:1  At that time יהושע
went through the grain fields on the Sabbath. And His taught ones were hungry,
and began to pluck heads of grain, to eat. 
Mat
12:2  And when the Pharisees saw it, they
said to Him, “Look, Your taught ones are doing what is not right to do on the
Sabbath!” 
Mat
12:3  But He said to them, “Have you not
read what Dawiḏ did when he was hungry, he and those who were with him: 
Mat
12:4  how he went into the House of
Elohim and ate the showbread which was not right for him to eat, nor for those
who were with him, but only for the priests? 
Mat
12:5  “Or did you not read in the Torah
that on the Sabbath the priests in the Set-apart Place profane the Sabbath, and
are blameless? 
Mat
12:6  “But I say to you that in this
place there is One greater than the Set-apart Place. 
Mat
12:7  “And if you had known what this
means, ‘I desire compassion and not offering,’ you would not have condemned the
blameless. 
Mat
12:8  “For the Son of Aḏam is
Master of the Sabbath.” 
Mat
12:9  And having left there, He went into
their congregation. 
Mat
12:10  And see, there was a man having a
withered hand. And they asked Him, saying, “Is it right to heal on the Sabbath?”
– so as to accuse Him. 
Mat
12:11  And He said to them, “What man is
there among you who has one sheep, and if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath,
shall not take hold of it and lift it out? 
Mat
12:12  “How much more worth is a man than
a sheep! So it is right to do good on the Sabbath.” 
Mat
12:13  Then He said to the man, “Stretch
out your hand.” And he stretched it out, and it was restored, as healthy as the
other. 
Mat
12:14  But the Pharisees went out and
took counsel against Him, so as to destroy Him. 
Mat
12:15  But יהושע,
knowing it, withdrew from there. And large crowds followed Him, and He healed
them all, 
Mat
12:16  and warned them not to make Him
known, 
Mat
12:17  in order that what was spoken by
Yeshayahu the prophet, might be filled, saying, 
Mat
12:18  “See, My Servant whom I have
chosen, My Beloved in whom My being did delight. I shall put My Spirit upon Him,
and He shall declare right-ruling to the nations. 
Mat
12:19  “He shall not strive nor cry out,
nor shall anyone hear His voice in the streets. 
Mat
12:20  “A crushed reed He shall not
break, and smoking flax He shall not quench, till He brings forth right-ruling
forever.
Mat
12:21  “And the nations shall trust in
His Name.” 
Mat
12:22  Then they brought to Him one who
was demon-possessed, blind and dumb. And He healed him, so that the blind and
dumb man both spoke and saw. 
Mat
12:23  And all the crowds were amazed and
said, “Is this the Son of Dawiḏ?” 
Mat
12:24  But when the Pharisees heard it
they said, “This one does not cast out demons except by Be‛elzebul, the
ruler of the demons.” 
Mat
12:25  And יהושע
knew their thoughts, and said to them, “Every reign divided against itself is
laid waste, and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand. 
Mat
12:26  “And if Satan casts out Satan, he
is divided against himself. How then does his reign stand? 
Mat
12:27  “And if I, by Be‛elzebul, do
cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast them out? Because of this they shall
be your judges. 
Mat
12:28  “But if I cast out demons by the
Spirit of Elohim, then the reign of Elohim has come upon you. 
Mat
12:29  “Or how is one able to enter a
strong man’s house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man?
And then he shall plunder his house. 
Mat
12:30  “He who is not with Me is against
Me, and he who does not gather with Me scatters abroad. 
Mat
12:31  “Because of this I say to you, all
sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit
shall not be forgiven men. 
Mat
12:32  “And whoever speaks a word against
the Son of Aḏam, it shall be forgiven him, but whoever speaks against the
Set-apart Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, either in this age or in the
age to come. 
Mat
12:33  “Either make the tree good and its
fruit good, or else make the tree rotten and its fruit rotten, for a tree is
known by its fruit. 
Mat
12:34  “Brood of adders! How are you able
to speak what is good – being wicked? For the mouth speaks from the overflow of
the heart. 
Mat
12:35  “The good man brings forth what is
good from the good treasures of his heart, and the wicked man brings forth what
is wicked from the wicked treasure. 
Mat
12:36  “And I say to you that for every
idle word men speak, they shall give an account of it in the day of judgment. 
Mat
12:37  “For by your words you shall be
declared righteous, and by your words you shall be declared unrighteous.” 
Mat
12:38  Then some of the scribes and
Pharisees answered, saying, “Teacher, we wish to see a sign from You.” 
Mat
12:39  But He answering, said to them, “A
wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and no sign shall be given
to it except the sign of the prophet Yonah. 
Mat
12:40  “For as Yonah was three days and
three nights in the stomach of the great fish, so shall the Son of Aḏam
be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. 
Mat
12:41  “Men of Ninewĕh shall stand
up in the judgment with this generation and condemn it, because they repented
at the preaching of Yonah, and look, a greater than Yonah is here. 
Mat
12:42  “The sovereigness of the South
shall rise up in the judgment with this generation and shall condemn it, for
she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Shelomoh, and look, a
greater than Shelomoh is here. 
Mat
12:43  “Now when the unclean spirit goes
out of a man, he goes through dry places, seeking rest, and finds none. 
Mat
12:44  “Then it says, ‘I shall return to
my house from which I came.’ And when it comes, it finds it empty, swept, and
decorated. 
Mat
12:45  “Then it goes and takes with it
seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they enter and dwell there.
And the last of that man is worse than the first. So shall it also be with this
wicked generation.” 
Mat
12:46  And while He was still talking to
the crowds, see, His mother and brothers stood outside, seeking to speak with
Him. 
Mat
12:47  And one said to Him, “See, Your
mother and Your brothers are standing outside, seeking to speak with You.” 
Mat
12:48  But He answering, said to the one
who spoke to Him, “Who is My mother and who are My brothers?” 
Mat
12:49  And having stretched out His hand
toward His taught ones, He said, “See My mother and My brothers! 
Mat
12:50  “For whoever does the desire of My
Father who is in the heavens is My brother and sister and mother.” 
Mat
13:1  And on that day יהושע
went out of the house and sat by the sea. 
Mat
13:2  And large crowds were gathered
together to Him, so that He went into a boat and sat down. And all the crowd
stood on the beach. 
Mat
13:3  And He spoke to them much in
parables, saying, “See, the sower went out to sow. 
Mat
13:4  “And as he sowed, some indeed fell
by the wayside, and the birds came and devoured them. 
Mat
13:5  “And others fell on rocky places,
where they did not have much soil, and immediately they sprang up, because they
had no depth of soil. 
Mat
13:6  “But when the sun was up they were
scorched, and because they had no root they withered. 
Mat
13:7  “And others fell among thorns, and
the thorns came up and choked them. 
Mat
13:8  “And others fell on good soil and
yielded a crop, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty. 
Mat
13:9  “He who has ears to hear, let him
hear!” 
Mat
13:10  And the taught ones came and said
to Him, “Why do You speak to them in parables?” 
Mat
13:11  And He answering, said to them, “Because
it has been given to you to know the secrets of the reign of the heavens, but
to them it has not been given. 
Mat
13:12  “For whoever possesses, to him
more shall be given, and he shall have overflowingly; but whoever does not
possess, even what he possesses shall be taken away from him. 
Mat
13:13  “Because of this I speak to them
in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor
do they understand. 
Mat
13:14  “And in them the prophecy of
Yeshayahu is completely filled, which says, ‘Hearing you shall hear and by no
means understand, and seeing you shall see and by no means perceive, 
Mat
13:15  for the heart of this people has
become thickened, and their ears are hard of hearing, and their eyes they have
closed, lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears, lest
they should understand with their heart, and turn back, and I heal them.’ 
Mat
13:16  “And blessed are your eyes because
they see, and your ears because they hear, 
Mat
13:17  for truly I say to you, that many
prophets and righteous ones longed to see what you see, and did not see it, and
to hear what you hear, and did not hear it. 
Mat
13:18  “You, then, hear the parable of
the sower: 
Mat
13:19  “When anyone hears the word of the
reign, and does not understand it, then the wicked one comes and snatches away
what was sown in his heart. This is that sown by the wayside. 
Mat
13:20  “And that sown on rocky places,
this is he who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy, 
Mat
13:21  yet he has no root in himself, but
is short-lived, and when pressure or persecution arises because of the word,
immediately he stumbles. 
Mat
13:22  “And that sown among the thorns is
he who hears the word, and the worry of this age and the deceit of riches choke
the word, and it becomes fruitless.
Mat
13:23  “And that sown on the good soil is
he who hears the word and understands it, who indeed bears fruit and yields –
some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.” 
Mat
13:24  Another parable He put before
them, saying, “The reign of the heavens has become like a man who sowed good
seed in his field, 
Mat
13:25  but while men slept, his enemy
came and sowed darnel among the wheat and went away. 
Mat
13:26  “And when the blade sprouted and
bore fruit, then the darnel also appeared. 
Mat
13:27  “And the servants of the master of
the house came and said to him, ‘Master, did you not sow good seed in your
field? From where then does it have the darnel?’ 
Mat
13:28  “And he said to them, ‘A man, an
enemy did this.’ And the servants said to him, ‘Do you wish then, that we go
and gather them up?’ 
Mat
13:29  “But he said, ‘No, lest while you
gather up the darnel you also uproot the wheat with them. 
Mat
13:30  ‘Let both grow together until the
harvest, and at the time of harvest I shall say to the reapers, “First gather
the darnel and bind them in bundles to burn them, but gather the wheat into my
granary.” ’ ” 
Mat
13:31  Another parable He put before
them, saying, “The reign of the heavens is like a mustard seed, which a man
took and sowed in his field, 
Mat
13:32  which indeed is less than all the
seeds, but when it is grown it is greater than the plants and becomes a tree,
so that the birds of the heaven come and dwell in its branches.” 
Mat
13:33  Another parable He spoke to them, “The
reign of the heavens is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three
measures of meal until all was leavened.” 
Mat
13:34  יהושע
said all this to the crowds in parables, and He did not speak to them without a
parable, 
Mat
13:35  so that what was spoken by the
prophet might be filled, saying, “I shall open My mouth in parables, I shall
pour forth what has been hidden from the foundation of the world.” 
Mat
13:36  Then, having sent the crowds away,
יהושע went into the house. And His taught ones
came to Him, saying, “Explain to us the parable of the darnel of the field.” 
Mat
13:37  And He answering, said to them, “He
who is sowing the good seed is the Son of Aḏam, 
Mat
13:38  and the field is the world. And
the good seed, these are the sons of the reign, but the darnel are the sons of
the wicked one, 
Mat
13:39  and the enemy who sowed them is
the devil. And the harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are the
messengers. 
Mat
13:40  “As the darnel, then, is gathered
and burned in the fire, so it shall be at the end of this age. 
Mat
13:41  “The Son of Aḏam shall send
out His messengers, and they shall gather out of His reign all the
stumbling-blocks, and those doing lawlessness, 
Mat
13:42  and shall throw them into the
furnace of fire – there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth. 
Mat
13:43  “Then the righteous shall shine
forth as the sun in the reign of their Father. He who has ears to hear, let him
hear!
Mat
13:44  “Again, the reign of the heavens
is like treasure hidden in a field, which a man having found it, hid, and for
joy over it he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field. 
Mat
13:45  “Again, the reign of the heavens
is like a man, a merchant, seeking fine pearls, 
Mat
13:46  who, when he had found one pearl
of great price, went and sold all that he had and bought it. 
Mat
13:47  “Again, the reign of the heavens
is like a dragnet that was thrown into the sea and gathered some of every kind,

Mat
13:48  which, when it was filled, they
drew to shore. And they sat down and gathered the good into containers, but
threw the rotten away. 
Mat
13:49  “Thus shall it be at the end of
the age: the messengers shall come forth, and separate the wicked out of the
midst of the righteous, 
Mat
13:50  and shall throw them into the
furnace of fire – there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.” 
Mat
13:51  יהושע
said to them, “Have you understood all this?” They said to Him, “Yea, Master.” 
Mat
13:52  And He said to them, “Therefore
every scholar of Scripture taught in
the reign of the heavens is like a householder who brings out of his treasure matters, renewed, and old.”
Mat
13:53  And it came to be, when יהושע
had ended these parables, that He left there. 
Mat
13:54  And when He had come to His own
country, He taught them in their congregation, so that they were astonished and
said, “Where did this One get this wisdom and miracles? 
Mat
13:55  “Is this not the son of the
carpenter? Is not His mother called Miryam? And His brothers Ya‛aqoḇ
and Yosĕph and Shim‛on and Yehuḏah? 
Mat
13:56  “And His sisters, are they not all
with us? Where then did this One get all this?” 
Mat
13:57  And they stumbled at Him. But יהושע
said to them, “A prophet is not unappreciated except in his own country and in
his own house.” 
Mat
13:58  And He did not do many miracles
there because of their unbelief. 
Mat
14:1  At that time Herodes the district
ruler heard the report about יהושע, 
Mat
14:2  and said to his servants, “This is
Yoḥanan the Immerser. He has risen from the dead, and that is why these
mighty powers are at work in him.” 
Mat
14:3  For Herodes had arrested
Yoḥanan, bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias, his brother
Philip’s wife, 
Mat
14:4  for Yoḥanan had said to him, “It
is not right for you to have her.” 
Mat
14:5  And wishing to kill him, he feared
the crowd, because they held him as a prophet. 
Mat
14:6  But as Herodes’ birthday was being
held, the daughter of Herodias danced before them and pleased Herodes, 
Mat
14:7  so he promised with an oath to give
her whatever she asked. 
Mat
14:8  And she, being urged on by her
mother, said, “Give me here the head of Yoḥanan the Immerser on a dish.” 
Mat
14:9  And the sovereign was sad, but
because of the oaths and the guests he commanded it to be given, 
Mat
14:10  and sent and beheaded
Yoḥanan in prison. 
Mat
14:11  And his head was brought on a dish
and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother. 
Mat
14:12  And his taught ones came and took
away the body and buried it, and went and reported to יהושע.

Mat
14:13  Now when יהושע
heard it, He withdrew from there by boat to a deserted place, by Himself. And
when the crowds heard it, they followed Him on foot from the cities. 
Mat
14:14  And when יהושע
came out, He saw a large crowd and was moved with compassion for them, and
healed their sick. 
Mat
14:15  And when evening came, His taught
ones came to Him, saying, “This is a deserted place, and the hour is already
late. Dismiss the crowds, so that they might go into the villages and buy food
for themselves.” 
Mat
14:16  But יהושע
said to them, “They do not need to go away, give them to eat yourselves.” 
Mat
14:17  And they said to Him, “We have here
only five loaves and two fish.” 
Mat
14:18  And He said, “Bring them here to
Me.” 
Mat
14:19  And commanding the crowds to sit
down on the grass, and taking the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up
to the heaven, He blessed and broke and gave the loaves to the taught ones. And
the taught ones gave to the crowds, 
Mat
14:20  and all ate and were satisfied.
And they picked up the pieces left over – twelve baskets, filled. 
Mat
14:21  And those who ate were about five
thousand men, besides women and children. 
Mat
14:22  And immediately יהושע
made His taught ones enter into the boat and go before Him to the other side,
while He dismissed the crowds. 
Mat
14:23  And having dismissed the crowds,
He went up to the mountain by Himself to pray. And when evening had come, He
was alone there. 
Mat
14:24  But the boat was now in the middle
of the sea, agitated by the waves, for the wind was against it. 
Mat
14:25  And in the fourth watch of the
night יהושע went to them, walking on the sea. 
Mat
14:26  And when the taught ones saw Him
walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, “It is a phantom!” And from
fear they cried. 
Mat
14:27  But immediately יהושע
spoke to them, saying, “Take courage, it is I, do not be afraid.” 
Mat
14:28  And Kĕpha answered Him and
said, “Master, if it is You, command me to come to You on the water.” 
Mat
14:29  And He said, “Come.” And when Kĕpha
had come down out of the boat, he walked on the water to go to יהושע.

Mat
14:30  But when he saw that the wind was
strong, he was afraid. And beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, “Master,
save me!” 
Mat
14:31  And immediately יהושע
stretched out His hand and took hold of him, and said to him, “O you of little
belief, why did you doubt?” 
Mat
14:32  And when they came into the boat, the
wind ceased. 
Mat
14:33  And those in the boat came and did
bow to Him, saying, “Truly You are the Son of Elohim.” 
Mat
14:34  And having passed over, they came
to the land of Gennĕsar. 
Mat
14:35  And when the men of that place
recognised Him, they sent out into all that surrounding country, and brought to
Him all who were sick, 
Mat
14:36  and begged Him to let them only
touch the tzitzit of His garment. And as many as touched it were completely
healed.
Mat
15:1  Then there came to יהושע
scribes and Pharisees from Yerushalayim, saying, 
Mat
15:2  “Why do Your taught ones transgress
the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat
bread.” 
Mat
15:3  But He answering, said to them, “Why
do you also transgress the command of Elohim because of your tradition?
Mat
15:4  “For Elohim has commanded, saying, ‘Respect
your father and your mother,’ and, ‘He who curses father or mother, let him be
put to death.’ 
Mat
15:5  “But you say, ‘Whoever says to his
father or mother, “Whatever profit you might have received from me has been
dedicated,” 
Mat
15:6  is certainly released from
respecting his father or mother.’ So you have nullified the command of Elohim
by your tradition. 
Mat
15:7  “Hypocrites! Yeshayahu rightly
prophesied about you, saying, 
Mat
15:8  ‘This people draw near to Me with
their mouth, and respect Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me. 
Mat
15:9  ‘But in vain do they worship Me,
teaching as teachings the commands of men.’ ”
Mat
15:10  And calling the crowd near, He
said to them, “Hear and understand: 
Mat
15:11  “Not that which goes into the
mouth defiles the man, but that which comes out of the mouth, this defiles the
man.” 
Mat
15:12  Then His taught ones came and said
to Him, “Do You know that the Pharisees stumbled when they heard this word?” 
Mat
15:13  But He answering, said, “Every
plant which My heavenly Father has not planted shall be uprooted. 
Mat
15:14  “Leave them alone. They are blind
leaders of the blind. And if the blind leads the blind, both shall fall into a
ditch.” 
Mat
15:15  And Kĕpha answering, said to
Him, “Explain this parable to us.” 
Mat
15:16  And יהושע
said, “Are you also still without understanding? 
Mat
15:17  “Do you not understand that
whatever enters into the mouth goes into the stomach, and is cast out in the
sewer? 
Mat
15:18  “But what comes out of the mouth
comes from the heart, and these defile the man. 
Mat
15:19  “For out of the heart come forth
wicked reasonings, murders, adulteries, whorings, thefts, false witnessings,
slanders. 
Mat
15:20  “These defile the man, but to eat
with unwashed hands does not defile the man.” 
Mat
15:21  And יהושע
went out from there and withdrew to the parts of Tsor and Tsiḏon. 
Mat
15:22  And see, a woman of Kena‛an
came from those borders and cried out to Him, saying, “Have compassion on me, O
Master, Son of Dawiḏ! My daughter is badly demon-possessed.” 
Mat
15:23  But He did not answer her a word.
And His taught ones came and asked Him, saying, “Send her away, because she
cries after us.” 
Mat
15:24  And He answering, said, “I was not
sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Yisra’ĕl.” 
Mat
15:25  But she came and was bowing to
Him, saying, “Master, help me!” 
Mat
15:26  And He answering, said, “It is not
good to take the children’s bread and throw it to the little dogs.” 
Mat
15:27  But she said, “Yea Master, for
even the little dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.”
Mat
15:28  And יהושע
answering, said to her, “O woman, your belief is great! Let it be to you as you
desire.” And her daughter was healed from that hour. 
Mat
15:29  And moving from there, יהושע
came toward the Sea of Galil, and going up on the mountain, He was sitting
there. 
Mat
15:30  And large crowds came to Him,
having with them those who were lame, blind, dumb, crippled, and many others.
And they laid them down at the feet of יהושע, and
He healed them, 
Mat
15:31  so that the crowd marvelled when
they saw the dumb speaking, the crippled well, the lame walking, and the blind
seeing. And they praised the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl. 
Mat
15:32  And יהושע,
having called His taught ones near, said, “I have compassion on the crowd,
because they have now continued with Me three days and do not have whatever to
eat. And I do not wish to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way.” 
Mat
15:33  And His taught ones said to Him, “Where
are we to get enough bread in the desert to satisfy such a large crowd?” 
Mat
15:34  And יהושע
said to them, “How many loaves do you have?” And they said, “Seven, and a few
little fish.” 
Mat
15:35  And He commanded the crowd to sit
down on the ground, 
Mat
15:36  and taking the seven loaves and
the fish, giving thanks, He broke them and gave to His taught ones, and the
taught ones to the crowd. 
Mat
15:37  And all ate and were satisfied,
and they picked up what was left over of the broken pieces – seven large
baskets, filled. 
Mat
15:38  And those who ate were four
thousand men, besides women and children. 
Mat
15:39  And dismissing the crowd, He went
into the boat, and came to the borders of Maḡdala. 
Mat
16:1  And the Pharisees and Sadducees
came, and trying Him asked that He would show them a sign from heaven. 
Mat
16:2  And He answering, said to them, “When
it is evening you say, ‘Fair weather, for the heaven is red,’ 
Mat
16:3  and in the morning, ‘Stormy weather
today, for the heaven is red and overcast.’ You know how to discern the face of the heaven, but you
are unable to discern the signs of the times! 
Mat
16:4  “A wicked and adulterous generation
seeks after a sign, and no sign shall be given to it except the sign of the
prophet Yonah.” And He left them and went away. 
Mat
16:5  And His taught ones came to the
other side, and had forgotten to take bread. 
Mat
16:6  And יהושע
said to them, “Mind! And beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the
Sadducees.” 
Mat
16:7  And they reasoned among themselves,
saying, “Because we brought no bread!” 
Mat
16:8  But יהושע,
aware of this, said to them, “O you of little belief, why do you reason among
yourselves because you brought no bread? 
Mat
16:9  “Do you still not understand,
neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand and how many baskets you
picked up? 
Mat
16:10  “Or the seven loaves of the four
thousand and how many large baskets you picked up? 
Mat
16:11  “How is it that you do not
understand that I did not speak to you concerning bread, but to beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees?” 
Mat
16:12  Then they understood that He did
not say to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees
and the Sadducees. 
Mat
16:13  Now when יהושע
came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi, He asked His taught ones, saying, “Who
do men say the Son of Aḏam is?” 
Mat
16:14  And they said, “Some say Yoḥanan the Immerser, and
others Ĕliyahu, and others Yirmeyahu or one of the prophets.” 
Mat
16:15  He said to them, “And you, who do
you say I am?” 
Mat
16:16  And Shim‛on Kĕpha
answering, said, “You are the Messiah, the Son of the living Elohim.” 
Mat
16:17  And יהושע
answering, said to him, “Blessed are you, Shim‛on Bar-Yonah, for flesh
and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father in the heavens. 
Mat
16:18  “And I also say to you that you
are Kĕpha, and on this rock I shall build My assembly, and the gates of
the grave shall not overcome it. 
Mat
16:19  “And I shall give you the keys of
the reign of the heavens, and whatever you bind on earth shall be having been
bound in the heavens, and whatever you loosen on earth shall be having been
loosened in the heavens.”
Mat
16:20  Then He warned His taught ones
that they should say to no one that He is יהושע
the Messiah. 
Mat
16:21  From that time יהושע
began to show to His taught ones that it was necessary for Him to go to
Yerushalayim, and to suffer much from the elders and chief priests and scribes,
and be killed, and to be raised again the third day. 
Mat
16:22  And Kĕpha took Him aside and
began to rebuke Him, saying, “Be kind to Yourself, Master, this shall not be to
You!” 
Mat
16:23  But He turned and said to Kĕpha,
“Get behind Me, Satan! You are a stumbling-block to Me, for your thoughts are
not those of Elohim, but those of men.” 
Mat
16:24  Then יהושע
said to His taught ones, “If anyone wishes to come after Me, let him deny
himself, and take up his stake, and follow Me. 
Mat
16:25  “For whoever wishes to save his
life shall lose it, and whoever loses his life for My sake shall find it. 
Mat
16:26  “For what is a man profited if he
gains all the world, and loses his own life? Or what shall a man give in
exchange for his life? 
Mat
16:27  “For the Son of Aḏam is
going to come in the esteem of His Father with His messengers, and then He
shall reward each according to his works.
Mat
16:28  “Truly, I say to you, there are
some standing here who shall not taste death at all until they see the Son of Aḏam
coming in His reign:”
Mat
17:1  And after six days יהושע
took Kĕpha, and Ya‛aqoḇ, and Yoḥanan his brother, and
brought them up on a high mountain by themselves, 
Mat
17:2  and He was transformed before them,
and His face shone like the sun, and His garments became as white as the light.

Mat
17:3  And see, Mosheh and Ĕliyahu
appeared to them, talking with Him. 
Mat
17:4  And Kĕpha answering, said to יהושע,
“Master, it is good for us to be here. If You wish, let us make here three
booths: one for You, one for Mosheh, and one for Ĕliyahu.”
Mat
17:5  While he was still speaking, see, a
bright cloud overshadowed them. And see, a voice came out of the cloud, saying,
“This is My Son, the Beloved, in whom I did delight. Hear Him!” 
Mat
17:6  And when the taught ones heard,
they fell on their faces and were much afraid. 
Mat
17:7  But יהושע
came near and touched them and said, “Rise, and do not be afraid.” 
Mat
17:8  And having lifted up their eyes,
they saw no one but יהושע only. 
Mat
17:9  And as they were coming down from
the mountain, יהושע commanded them, saying, “Do
not mention the vision to anyone until the Son of Aḏam is raised from the
dead.” 
Mat
17:10  And His taught ones asked Him,
saying, “Why then do the scribes say that Ĕliyahu has to come first?” 
Mat
17:11  And יהושע
answering, said to them, “Ĕliyahu is indeed coming first, and shall
restore all matters.
Mat
17:12  “But I say to you that Ĕliyahu
has already come, and they did not recognise him but did to him whatever they
wished. In this way the Son of Aḏam is also about to suffer by them.” 
Mat
17:13  Then the taught ones understood
that He had spoken to them about Yoḥanan the Immerser. 
Mat
17:14  And when they came to the crowd, a
man came up to Him, kneeling down to Him and saying, 
Mat
17:15  “Master, have compassion on my
son, for he is an epileptic and suffers badly, for he often falls into the fire
and often into the water. 
Mat
17:16  “And I brought him to Your taught
ones, but they were unable to heal him.” 
Mat
17:17  And יהושע
answering, said, “O generation, unbelieving and perverted, how long shall I be
with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring him here to Me.” 
Mat
17:18  And יהושע
rebuked the demon, and he came out of him. And the child was healed from that
hour. 
Mat
17:19  Then the taught ones came to יהושע
by Himself and said, “Why were we unable to cast him out?” 
Mat
17:20  And יהושע
said to them, “Because of your unbelief, for truly, I say to you, if you have
belief as a mustard seed, you shall say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to
there,’ and it shall move. And no matter shall be impossible for you. 
Mat
17:21  “But this kind does not go out
except through prayer and fasting.” 
Mat
17:22  And while they were staying in
Galil, יהושע said to them, “The Son of Aḏam
is about to be delivered up into the hands of men, 
Mat
17:23  and they shall kill Him, and the
third day He shall be raised up.” And they were deeply grieved. 
Mat
17:24  And when they came into Kephar
Naḥum, those who received the tax came to Kĕpha and said, “Does your
Teacher not pay the tax?” 
Mat
17:25  He said, “Yea.” And when he came
into the house, יהושע spoke to him first, saying,
“What do you think, Shim‛on? From whom do the sovereigns of the earth
take toll or tax, from their own sons or from the strangers?” 
Mat
17:26  Kĕpha then said to Him, “From the strangers.” יהושע
said to him, “Then the sons are exempt. 
Mat
17:27  “But, lest we cause them to
stumble, go to the sea, cast in a hook, and take the fish that comes up first.
And when you have opened its mouth, you shall find a piece of money. Take that
and give it to them for Me and you.” 
Mat
18:1  At that time the taught ones came
to יהושע, saying, “Who, then, is greatest in the
reign of the heavens?” 
Mat
18:2  And יהושע
called a little child to Him, set him in their midst, 
Mat
18:3  and said, “Truly, I say to you,
unless you turn and become as little children, you shall by no means enter into
the reign of the heavens. 
Mat
18:4  “Whoever then humbles himself as
this little child is the greatest in the reign of the heavens. 
Mat
18:5  “And whoever receives one little
child like this in My Name receives Me. 
Mat
18:6  “But whoever causes one of these
little ones who believe in Me to stumble, it is better for him that a millstone
be hung around his neck, and that he be drowned in the depth of the sea. 
Mat
18:7  “Woe to the world because of stumbling-blocks!
For it is necessary that stumbling-blocks come, but woe to that man by whom the
stumbling-block comes! 
Mat
18:8  “And if your hand or foot causes
you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away from you. It is better for you to
enter into life lame or crippled, rather than having two hands or two feet, to
be thrown into the everlasting fire. 
Mat
18:9  “And if your eye causes you to
stumble, pluck it out and throw it away from you. It is better for you to enter
into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes, to be thrown into the fire
of Gehenna. 
Mat
18:10  “See that you do not despise one
of these little ones, for I say to you that in the heavens their messengers
always see the face of My Father who is in the heavens. 
Mat
18:11  “For the Son of Aḏam has
come to save what was lost. 
Mat
18:12  “What do you think? If a man has a
hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray, would he not leave the ninety-nine
on the mountains, going to seek the one that is straying? 
Mat
18:13  “And if he should find it, truly,
I say to you, he rejoices more over that sheep than over the ninety-nine that
did not go astray. 
Mat
18:14  “Thus it is not the desire of your
Father who is in the heavens that one of these little ones should be lost. 
Mat
18:15  “And if your brother sins against
you, go and reprove him, between you and him alone. If he hears you, you have
gained your brother. 
Mat
18:16  “But if he does not hear, take
with you one or two more, that ‘by the mouth of two or three witnesses every
word might be established.’ 
Mat
18:17  “And if he refuses to hear them,
say it to the assembly. And if he refuses even to hear the assembly, let him be
to you like a gentile and a tax collector. 
Mat
18:18  “Truly, I say to you, whatever you
bind on earth shall be having been bound in heaven, and whatever you loosen on
earth shall be having been loosened in heaven.
Mat
18:19  “Again I say to you that if two of
you agree on earth concerning any matter that they ask, it shall be done for
them by My Father in the heavens. 
Mat
18:20  “For where two or three are
gathered together in My Name, there I am in their midst.” 
Mat
18:21  Then Kĕpha came to Him and
said, “Master, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Up
to seven times?” 
Mat
18:22  יהושע
said to him, “I do not say to you, up to seven times, but up to seventy times
seven. 
Mat
18:23  “Because of this the reign of the
heavens is like a certain man, a sovereign who wished to settle accounts with
his servants. 
Mat
18:24  “And when he had begun to settle,
one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents, 
Mat
18:25  but as he was unable to pay, his
master commanded that he be sold, with his wife and children and all that he
had, and payment to be made. 
Mat
18:26  “Then the servant fell down before
him, saying, ‘Master, have patience with me, and I shall pay you all.’ 
Mat
18:27  “And the master of that servant
was moved with compassion, released him, and forgave him the debt. 
Mat
18:28  “And that servant went out and
found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred pieces of money. And he
laid hands on him and took him by the throat, saying, ‘Pay me what you owe!’ 
Mat
18:29  “Then his fellow servant fell down
at his feet and begged him, saying, ‘Have patience with me, and I shall pay you
all.’ 
Mat
18:30  “But he would not, and went and
threw him into prison till he should pay the debt. 
Mat
18:31  “And when his fellow servants saw
what had been done, they were deeply grieved, and came and reported to their master
all that had taken place. 
Mat
18:32  “Then his master called him and
said to him, ‘Wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt seeing you begged me.

Mat
18:33  ‘Should you not also have had
compassion on your fellow servant, as I also had compassion on you?’ 
Mat
18:34  “And his master was wroth, and
delivered him to the torturers until he should pay all that was due to him. 
Mat
18:35  “So also My heavenly Father shall
do to you if each of you, from his heart, does not forgive his brother his
trespasses.” 
Mat
19:1  And it came to be, when יהושע
had ended these words, that He left Galil and came to the borders of Yehuḏah
beyond the Yardĕn. 
Mat
19:2  And large crowds followed Him, and
He healed them there. 
Mat
19:3  And the Pharisees came to Him, trying
Him, and saying to Him, “Is it right for a man to put away his wife for every
reason?” 
Mat
19:4  And He answering, said to them, “Did
you not read that He who made them at the beginning made them male and female, 
Mat
19:5  and said, ‘For this cause a man
shall leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife, and the two shall
become one flesh’? 
Mat
19:6  “So that they are no longer two,
but one flesh. Therefore, what Elohim has joined together, let man not
separate.” 
Mat
19:7  They said to Him, “Why then did
Mosheh command to give a certificate of divorce, and to put her away?” 
Mat
19:8  He said to them, “Because of the
hardness of your hearts, Mosheh allowed you to put away your wives, but from
the beginning it was not so. 
Mat
19:9  “And I say to you, whoever puts
away his wife, except on the ground of whoring, and marries another, commits
adultery. And whoever marries her who has been put away commits adultery.”
Mat
19:10  His taught ones said to Him, “If
such is the case of the man with his wife, it is good not to marry.” 
Mat
19:11  And He said to them, “Not all
receive this word, but only those to whom it has been given, 
Mat
19:12  for there are eunuchs who were so
born from their mother’s womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by
men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the
reign of the heavens. He who is able to receive it, let him receive it.” 
Mat
19:13  Then young children were brought
to Him to lay His hands on them and pray, and the taught ones rebuked them. 
Mat
19:14  But יהושע
said, “Allow the young children and do not stop them from coming to Me, for of
such is the reign of the heavens.” 
Mat
19:15  And having laid hands on them He
went from there. 
Mat
19:16  And see, one came and said to Him,
“Good Teacher, what good shall I do to have everlasting life?” 
Mat
19:17  And He said to him, “Why do you
call Me good? No one is good except One – Elohim. But if you wish to enter into
life, guard the commands.”
Mat
19:18  He said to Him, “Which?” And יהושע
said, “ ‘You shall not murder,’ ‘You shall not commit adultery,’ ‘You shall not
steal,’ ‘You shall not bear false witness,’ 
Mat
19:19  ‘Respect your father and your
mother,’ and ‘You shall love your neighbour as yourself.’ ” 
Mat
19:20  The young man said to Him, “All
these I have watched over from my youth, what do I still lack?” 
Mat
19:21  יהושע
said to him, “If you wish to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the
poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven. And come, follow Me.” 
Mat
19:22  And when the young man heard the
word, he went away sad, because he had many possessions. 
Mat
19:23  And יהושע
said to His taught ones, “Truly, I say to you that it is hard for a rich man to
enter into the reign of the heavens. 
Mat
19:24  And again I say to you, it is
easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to
enter into the reign of Elohim.” 
Mat
19:25  And when His taught ones heard it,
they were very astonished, saying, “Who then is able to be saved?” 
Mat
19:26  And looking intently יהושע
said to them, “With men this is impossible, but with Elohim all is possible.” 
Mat
19:27  Then Kĕpha answering, said to
Him, “See, we have left all and followed You. What then shall we have?” 
Mat
19:28  And יהושע
said to them, “Truly I say to you, when the Son of Aḏam sits on the
throne of His esteem, you who have followed Me in the rebirth, shall also sit
on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Yisra’ĕl. 
Mat
19:29  “And everyone who has left houses
or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands, for My
Name’s sake, shall receive a hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life. 
Mat
19:30  “But many who are first shall be
last, and the last first. 
Mat
20:1  “For the reign of the heavens is
like a man, a householder who went out early in the morning to hire workers for
his vineyard. 
Mat
20:2  “And when he had agreed with the
workers for a silver piece a day, he sent them into his vineyard. 
Mat
20:3  “And he went out about the third hour
and saw others standing idle in the market-place, 
Mat
20:4  and said to them, ‘You too go into
the vineyard, and whatever is right I shall give you.’ And they went. 
Mat
20:5  “Having gone out again about the
sixth and the ninth hour, he did likewise. 
Mat
20:6  “And about the eleventh hour,
having gone out, he found others standing idle, and said to them, ‘Why do you
stand here idle all day?’ 
Mat
20:7  “They said to him, ‘Because no one
hired us.’ He said to them, ‘You too go into the vineyard, and whatever is
right you shall receive.’ 
Mat
20:8  “And when evening came, the master
of the vineyard said to his manager, ‘Call the workers and pay them their
wages, beginning with the last to the first.’ 
Mat
20:9  “And when those came who were hired
about the eleventh hour, they each received a silver piece. 
Mat
20:10  “And when the first came, they
thought they would receive more. But they too received each a silver piece. 
Mat
20:11  “And when they received it, they
grumbled against the householder, 
Mat
20:12  saying, ‘These last have worked only one hour, and you made them equal
to us who have borne the burden and the heat of the day.’ 
Mat
20:13  “But he answering, said to one of
them, ‘Friend, I do you no wrong. Did you not agree with me for a silver piece?

Mat
20:14  ‘Take yours and go. But I wish to
give to this last man as also to you. 
Mat
20:15  ‘Is it not right for me to do what
I wish with my own? Or is your eye evil because I am good?’ 
Mat
20:16  “Thus the last shall be first, and
the first last. For many are called, but few chosen.”
Mat
20:17  And יהושע,
going up to Yerushalayim, took the twelve taught ones aside on the way and said
to them, 
Mat
20:18  “See, we are going up to
Yerushalayim, and the Son of Aḏam shall be delivered up to the chief
priests and to the scribes. And they shall condemn Him to death, 
Mat
20:19  and deliver Him to the gentiles to
mock and to flog and to impale. And the third day He shall be raised.” 
Mat
20:20  Then the mother of the sons of Zaḇdai
came to Him with her sons, bowing down and making a request of Him. 
Mat
20:21  And He said to her, “What do you
wish?” She said to Him, “Command that these two sons of mine might sit, one on
Your right hand and the other on the left, in Your reign.” 
Mat
20:22  But יהושע
answering, said, “You do not know what you ask. Are you able to drink the cup
that I am about to drink, and to be immersed with the immersion that I am
immersed with?” They said to Him, “We are able.” 
Mat
20:23  And He said to them, “You shall
indeed drink My cup, and you shall be immersed with the immersion that I am
immersed with. But to sit on My right hand and on My left is not Mine to give,
but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by My Father.”
Mat
20:24  And when the ten heard it, they
were displeased at the two brothers. 
Mat
20:25  But יהושע
called them near and said, “You know that the rulers of the gentiles are
masters over them, and those who are great exercise authority over them. 
Mat
20:26  “But it shall not be so among you,
but whoever wishes to become great among you, let him be your servant. 
Mat
20:27  “And whoever wishes to be first
among you, let him be your servant, 
Mat
20:28  even as the Son of Aḏam did
not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life as a ransom for many.”
Mat
20:29  And as they were leaving
Yeriḥo, a large crowd followed Him. 
Mat
20:30  And see, two blind men sitting by
the way, having heard that יהושע was passing by,
cried out, saying, “Have compassion on us, O Master, Son of Dawiḏ!” 
Mat
20:31  And the crowd rebuked them that
they should be silent, but they cried out all the more, saying, “Have
compassion on us, O Master, Son of Dawiḏ!” 
Mat
20:32  And יהושע
stopped and called them, and said, “What do you wish Me to do for you?” 
Mat
20:33  They said to Him, “Master, that
our eyes be opened.” 
Mat
20:34  And having been moved with
compassion, יהושע touched their eyes. And
immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed Him. 
Mat
21:1  And when they came near to
Yerushalayim, and came to Bĕyth Phaḡi, at the Mount of Olives, then יהושע
sent two taught ones, 
Mat
21:2  saying to them, “Go into the
village opposite you, and straightaway you shall find a donkey tied, and a colt
with her, loosen them, and bring them
to Me. 
Mat
21:3  “And if anyone says whatever to
you, you shall say, ‘The Master needs them,’ and immediately he shall send
them.” 
Mat
21:4  And all this took place that it
might be filled what was spoken by the prophet, saying, 
Mat
21:5  “Say to the daughter of Tsiyon, ‘See,
your Sovereign is coming to you, meek, and sitting on a donkey, even a colt,
the foal of a donkey.’ ” 
Mat
21:6  And the taught ones went, and
having done as יהושע ordered them, 
Mat
21:7  they brought the donkey and the
colt, and laid their garments on them, and He sat on them. 
Mat
21:8  And most of the crowd spread their
garments on the way, while others cut down branches from the trees and spread
them on the way. 
Mat
21:9  And the crowds who went before and
those who followed cried out, saying, “Hoshia-na to the Son of Dawiḏ!
Blessed is He who is coming in the Name of יהוה !
Hoshia-na in the highest!” 
Mat
21:10  And as He entered into
Yerushalayim, all the city was stirred, saying, “Who is this?” 
Mat
21:11  And the crowds said, “This is יהושע,
the prophet from Natsareth of Galil.” 
Mat
21:12  And יהושע
went into the Set-apart Place of Elohim and drove out all those buying and
selling in the Set-apart Place, and overturned the tables of the moneychangers
and the seats of those who sold doves. 
Mat
21:13  And He said to them, “It has been
written, ‘My House shall be called a house of prayer,’ but you have made it a ‘den
of robbers.’ ” 
Mat
21:14  And blind and lame ones came to
Him in the Set-apart Place, and He healed them. 
Mat
21:15  But when the chief priests and
scribes saw the wonders which He did, and the children crying out in the
Set-apart Place and saying, “Hoshia-na to the Son of Dawiḏ!” they were
greatly displeased, 
Mat
21:16  and said to Him, “Do You hear what
these say?” And יהושע said to them, “Yea, have
you never read, ‘Out of the mouth of babes and nurslings You have perfected
praise’?” 
Mat
21:17  And having left them He went out
of the city to Bĕyth Anyah, and spent the night there. 
Mat
21:18  And returning to the city early in
the morning, He became hungry. 
Mat
21:19  And seeing a single fig tree by
the way, He came to it and found naught on it but leaves, and said to it, “Let
no fruit grow on you ever again.” And immediately the fig tree withered. 
Mat
21:20  And the taught ones, seeing it,
marvelled, saying, “How did the fig tree wither so soon?” 
Mat
21:21  And יהושע
answering, said to them, “Truly, I say to you, if you have belief and do not
doubt, you shall not only do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you say
to this mountain, ‘Be removed and be thrown into the sea,’ it shall be done. 
Mat
21:22  “And whatever you ask in prayer,
believing, you shall receive.” 
Mat
21:23  And when He had come into the
Set-apart Place, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to Him as
He was teaching, and said, “By what authority are You doing these? And who gave
You this authority?” 
Mat
21:24  And יהושע
answering, said to them, “I shall ask you one question too, which if you answer
Me, I also shall say to you by what authority I do these: 
Mat
21:25  “The immersion of Yoḥanan,
where did it come from? From heaven or from men?” So they reasoned among
themselves, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ He shall say to us, ‘Then why
did you not believe him?’ 
Mat
21:26  “But if we say, ‘From men,’ we
fear the crowd, for all hold Yoḥanan as a prophet.” 
Mat
21:27  And they answered יהושע
and said, “We do not know.” And He said to them, “Neither do I say to you by
what authority I do these. 
Mat
21:28  “But what do you think? A man had
two sons, and he came to the first and said, ‘Son, go, work today in my
vineyard.’ 
Mat
21:29  “And he answering, said, ‘I do not
wish to,’ but afterwards he repented and went. 
Mat
21:30  “And having come to the second, he
said similarly. And he answering, said, ‘I go,
master,’ but he did not go. 
Mat
21:31  “Which of the two did the desire
of the father?” They said to Him, “The first.” יהושע
said to them, “Truly, I say to you that tax collectors and whores are entering
into the reign of Elohim before you, 
Mat
21:32  for Yoḥanan came to you in
the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but tax collectors and
whores believed him. And when you saw it, you did not repent afterwards, to
believe him. 
Mat
21:33  “Hear another parable: There was a
certain man, a householder who planted a vineyard and placed a hedge around it,
and dug a winepress in it and built a watchtower. And he leased it to farmers
and went abroad. 
Mat
21:34  “And when the season of the fruits
drew near, he sent his servants to the farmers, to receive its fruit. 
Mat
21:35  “And the farmers took his servants
and beat one, and they killed one, and they stoned another. 
Mat
21:36  “Again he sent other servants,
more than the first, and they did likewise to them. 
Mat
21:37  “And at last he sent his son to
them, saying, ‘They shall respect my son.’ 
Mat
21:38  “But when the farmers saw the son,
they said among themselves, ‘This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, and let
us possess his inheritance.’ 
Mat
21:39  “And they took him, and threw him
out of the vineyard, and killed him. 
Mat
21:40  “Therefore, when the master of the
vineyard comes, what shall he do to those farmers?” 
Mat
21:41  They said to Him, “Evil ones! He
shall bring them to evil destruction, and lease the vineyard to other farmers
who shall give to him the fruits in their seasons.” 
Mat
21:42  יהושע
said to them, “Did you never read in the Scriptures, ‘The stone which the
builders rejected has become the chief corner-stone. This was from יהוה,
and it is marvellous in our eyes’? 
Mat
21:43  “Because of this I say to you: the
reign of Elohim shall be taken from you and given to a nation bringing forth
the fruits of it. 
Mat
21:44  “And he who falls on this stone
shall be broken, but on whomever it falls, he shall be pulverised.”
Mat
21:45  And the chief priests and
Pharisees, having heard His parables, knew that He was speaking of them. 
Mat
21:46  And seeking to lay hands on Him,
they feared the crowds, seeing they held Him to be a prophet. 
Mat
22:1  And יהושע
responded and spoke to them again by parables and said, 
Mat
22:2  “The reign of the heavens is like a
man, a sovereign, who made a wedding feast for his son, 
Mat
22:3  and sent out his servants to call
those who were invited to the wedding feast. But they would not come. 
Mat
22:4  “Again he sent out other servants,
saying, ‘Say to those who are invited, “See, I have prepared my dinner. My oxen
and fattened cattle are slaughtered, and all is ready. Come to the wedding
feast.” ’ 
Mat
22:5  “But they disregarded it and went
their way – this one to his field, that one to his trade. 
Mat
22:6  “And the rest, having seized his
servants, insulted and killed them. 
Mat
22:7  “But when the sovereign heard, he
was wroth, and sent out his soldiers, destroyed those murderers, and set their
city on fire. 
Mat
22:8  “Then he said to his servants, ‘The
wedding feast, indeed, is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy. 
Mat
22:9  ‘Therefore go into the street
corners, and as many as you find, invite to the wedding feast.’ 
Mat
22:10  “And those servants went out into
the street corners and gathered all whom they found, both wicked and good. And
the wedding hall was filled with guests. 
Mat
22:11  “And when the sovereign came in to
view the guests, he saw there a man who had not put on a wedding garment, 
Mat
22:12  and he said to him, ‘Friend, how
did you come in here not having a wedding garment?’ And he was speechless. 
Mat
22:13  “Then the sovereign said to the
servants, ‘Bind him hand and foot, take him away, and throw him out into the
outer darkness – there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’ 
Mat
22:14  “For many are called, but few are
chosen.”
Mat
22:15  Then the Pharisees went and plotted
how to trap Him in His words. 
Mat
22:16  And they sent to Him their taught
ones with the Herodians, saying, “Teacher, we know that You are true, and teach
the way of Elohim in truth, and it does not concern You about anyone, for You
are not partial to any man. 
Mat
22:17  “Then say to us, what do You
think? Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?” 
Mat
22:18  But knowing their wickedness, יהושע
said, “Why do you try Me, you hypocrites? 
Mat
22:19  “Show Me the coin of the tax.” And
they brought Him a silver piece. 
Mat
22:20  And He said to them, “Whose
likeness and inscription is this?” 
Mat
22:21  They said to Him, “Caesar’s.” And
He said to them, “Then give to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to Elohim what is
Elohim’s.” 
Mat
22:22  And having heard, they marvelled,
and left Him and went away. 
Mat
22:23  On that day Sadducees, who say
there is no resurrection, came to Him and asked Him, 
Mat
22:24  saying, “Teacher, Mosheh said that
if anyone should die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife and
raise offspring for his brother. 
Mat
22:25  “And there were with us seven
brothers, and the first died after he had married, and having no children, left
his wife to his brother. 
Mat
22:26  “In the same way the second also,
and the third, unto the seventh. 
Mat
22:27  “And last of all the woman died
too. 
Mat
22:28  “At the resurrection, then, whose
wife of the seven shall she be – for all had her?” 
Mat
22:29  And יהושע
answering, said to them, “You go astray, not knowing the Scriptures nor the
power of Elohim.
Mat
22:30  “For in the resurrection they do
not marry, nor are they given in marriage, but are as messengers of Elohim in
heaven. 
Mat
22:31  “And concerning the resurrection
of the dead, have you not read what was spoken to you by Elohim, saying, 
Mat
22:32  ‘I am the Elohim of Aḇraham,
and the Elohim of Yitsḥaq, and the Elohim of Ya‛aqoḇ’? Elohim
is not the Elohim of the dead, but of the living.” 
Mat
22:33  And when the crowds heard, they
were astonished at His teaching. 
Mat
22:34  But the Pharisees, having heard
that He had silenced the Sadducees, were gathered together, 
Mat
22:35  and one of them, one learned in
the Torah, did question, trying Him, and saying, 
Mat
22:36  “Teacher, which is the great
command in the Torah?” 
Mat
22:37  And יהושע
said to him, “ ‘You shall love יהוה your Elohim with
all your heart, and with all your being, and with all your mind.’ 
Mat
22:38  “This is the first and great
command. 
Mat
22:39  “And the second is like it, ‘You
shall love your neighbour as yourself.’ 
Mat
22:40  “On these two commands hang all
the Torah and the Prophets.” 
Mat
22:41  And when the Pharisees were
gathered together, יהושע asked them, 
Mat
22:42  saying, “What do you think
concerning the Messiah? Whose Son is He?” They said to Him, “The Son of Dawiḏ.” 
Mat
22:43  He said to them, “Then how does
Dawiḏ in the Spirit call Him ‘Master,’ saying, 
Mat
22:44  ‘ יהוה
said to my Master, “Sit at My right hand, until I make Your enemies a footstool
of Your feet” ’? 
Mat
22:45  “If then Dawiḏ calls Him ‘Master,’
how is He his Son?” 
Mat
22:46  And no one was able to answer Him
a word, and from that day on no one was bold enough to ask Him any more questions. 
Mat
23:1  Then יהושע
spoke to the crowds and to His taught ones, 
Mat
23:2  saying, “The scribes and the
Pharisees sit on the seat of Mosheh. 
Mat
23:3  “Therefore, whatever they say to
you to guard, guard and do. But do not do according to their works, for they
say, and do not do. 
Mat
23:4  “For they bind heavy burdens, hard
to bear, and lay them on men’s shoulders, but with their finger they do not
wish to move them. 
Mat
23:5  “And they do all their works to be
seen by men, and they make their t’fillen wide and lengthen the tzitziyot of
their garments,
Mat
23:6  and they love the best place at
feasts, and the best seats in the congregations, 
Mat
23:7  and the greetings in the
market-places, and to be called by men, ‘Rabbi, Rabbi.’ 
Mat
23:8  “But you, do not be called ‘Rabbi,’
for One is your Teacher, the Messiah, and you are all brothers. 
Mat
23:9  “And do not call anyone on earth your father, for One is
your Father, He who is in the heavens. 
Mat
23:10  “Neither be called leaders, for
One is your Leader, the Messiah. 
Mat
23:11  “But the greatest among you shall
be your servant. 
Mat
23:12  “And whoever exalts himself shall
be humbled, and whoever humbles himself shall be exalted. 
Mat
23:13  “But woe to you, scribes and
Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you shut up the reign of the heavens before men,
for you do not go in, nor do you allow those who are entering to go in. 
Mat
23:14  “Woe to you, scribes and
Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you eat up widows’ houses, and for a show make
long prayers. Because of this you shall receive greater judgment. 
Mat
23:15  “Woe to you, scribes and
Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you go about the land and the sea to win one
convert, and when he is won, you make him a son of Gehenna twofold more than
yourselves. 
Mat
23:16  “Woe to you, blind guides, who
say, ‘Whoever swears by the Dwelling Place, it does not matter, but whoever
swears by the gold of the Dwelling Place, is bound by oath.’ 
Mat
23:17  “Fools and blind! For which is
greater, the gold or the Dwelling Place that sets the gold apart? 
Mat
23:18  “And, ‘Whoever swears by the
altar, it does not matter, but whoever swears by the gift that is on it, is
bound by oath.’ 
Mat
23:19  “Fools and blind! For which is
greater, the gift or the altar that sets the gift apart? 
Mat
23:20  “He, then, who swears by the
altar, swears by it and by all that is upon it. 
Mat
23:21  “And he who swears by the Dwelling
Place, swears by it and by Him who is dwelling in it. 
Mat
23:22  “And he who swears by the heaven,
swears by the throne of Elohim and by Him who is sitting upon it. 
Mat
23:23  “Woe to you, scribes and
Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you tithe the mint and the anise and the cumin,
and have neglected the weightier matters
of the Torah: the right-ruling and the compassion and the belief. These need to
have been done, without neglecting the others.
Mat
23:24  “Blind guides – straining out a
gnat and swallowing a camel! 
Mat
23:25  “Woe to you, scribes and
Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you clean the outside of the cup and dish, but
inside they are filled with plunder and unrighteousness. 
Mat
23:26  “Blind Pharisee, first clean the
inside of the cup and dish, so that the outside of them becomes clean too. 
Mat
23:27  “Woe to you, scribes and
Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you are like whitewashed tombs which outwardly
indeed look well, but inside are filled with dead men’s bones and all
uncleanness. 
Mat
23:28  “So you too outwardly indeed
appear righteous to men, but inside you are filled with hypocrisy and
lawlessness.
Mat
23:29  “Woe to you, scribes and
Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you build the tombs of the prophets and decorate
the monuments of the righteous, 
Mat
23:30  and say, ‘If we had lived in the
days of our fathers, we would not have taken part with them in the blood of the
prophets.’ 
Mat
23:31  “Thus you bear witness against
yourselves that you are sons of those who did murder the prophets – 
Mat
23:32  and you fill up the measure of
your fathers! 
Mat
23:33  “Serpents, brood of adders! How
would you escape the judgment of Gehenna? 
Mat
23:34  “Because of this, see, I send you
prophets, and wise men, and scholars of Scripture. Some of them you shall kill
and impale, and some of them you shall flog in your congregations and persecute
from city to city,
Mat
23:35  so that on you should come all the
righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of righteous Heḇel to
the blood of Zeḵaryah, son of Bereḵyah, whom you murdered between
the Dwelling Place and the altar. 
Mat
23:36  “Truly, I say to you, all this
shall come upon this generation. 
Mat
23:37  “Yerushalayim, Yerushalayim,
killing the prophets and stoning those who are sent to her! How often I wished
to gather your children together, the way a hen gathers her chickens under her
wings, but you would not! 
Mat
23:38  “See! Your house is left to you
laid waste,
Mat
23:39  for I say to you, from now on you
shall by no means see Me, until you say, ‘Blessed is He who is coming in the
Name of יהוה !’ ”
Mat
24:1  And going out, יהושע
went away from the Set-apart Place, and His taught ones came near to point out
to Him the buildings of the Set-apart Place. 
Mat
24:2  And יהושע
said to them, “Do you not see all these? Truly, I say to you, not one stone
shall be left here upon another, at all, which shall not be thrown down.” 
Mat
24:3  And as He sat on the Mount of
Olives, the taught ones came to Him separately, saying, “Say to us, when shall
this be, and what is the sign of Your coming, and of the end of the age?” 
Mat
24:4  And יהושע
answering, said to them, “Take heed that no one leads you astray. 
Mat
24:5  “For many shall come in My Name,
saying, ‘I am the Messiah,’ and they shall lead many astray. 
Mat
24:6  “And you shall begin to hear of
fightings and reports of fightings. See that you are not troubled, for these
have to take place, but the end is not yet. 
Mat
24:7  “For nation shall rise against
nation, and reign against reign. And there shall be scarcities of food, and
deadly diseases, and earthquakes in places. 
Mat
24:8  “And all these are the beginning of
birth pains. 
Mat
24:9  “Then they shall deliver you up to
affliction and kill you, and you shall be hated by all nations for My Name’s
sake. 
Mat
24:10  “And then many shall stumble, and
they shall deliver up one another, and shall hate one another. 
Mat
24:11  “And many false prophets shall
rise up and lead many astray. 
Mat
24:12  “And because of the increase in
lawlessness, the love of many shall become cold. 
Mat
24:13  “But he who shall have endured to
the end shall be saved.
Mat
24:14  “And this Good News of the reign
shall be proclaimed in all the world as a witness to all the nations, and then
the end shall come. 
Mat
24:15  “So when you see the ‘abomination
that lays waste,’ spoken of by Dani’ĕl the prophet, set up in the
set-apart place” – he who reads, let him understand –
Mat
24:16  “then let those who are in Yehuḏah
flee to the mountains. 
Mat
24:17  “Let him who is on the house-top
not come down to take whatever out of his house. 
Mat
24:18  “And let him who is in the field
not turn back to get his garments. 
Mat
24:19  “And woe to those who are pregnant
and to those who are nursing children in those days! 
Mat
24:20  “And pray that your flight does
not take place in winter or on the Sabbath. 
Mat
24:21  “For then there shall be great
distress, such as has not been since the beginning of the world until this
time, no, nor ever shall be.
Mat
24:22  “And if those days were not
shortened, no flesh would be saved, but for the sake of the chosen ones those
days shall be shortened. 
Mat
24:23  “If anyone then says to you, ‘Look,
here is the Messiah!’ or ‘There!’ do not believe. 
Mat
24:24  “For false messiahs and false
prophets shall arise, and they shall show great signs and wonders, so as to
lead astray, if possible, even the chosen ones. 
Mat
24:25  “See, I have forewarned you. 
Mat
24:26  “So if they say to you, ‘Look, He
is in the desert!’ do not go out; or ‘Look, He is in the inner rooms!’ do not
believe. 
Mat
24:27  “For as the lightning comes from
the east and shines to the west, so also shall the coming of the Son of Aḏam
be. 
Mat
24:28  “For wherever the dead body is,
there the eagles shall be gathered together.
Mat
24:29  “And immediately after the
distress of those days the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give
its light, and the stars shall fall from the heaven, and the powers of the
heavens shall be shaken.
Mat
24:30  “And then the sign of the Son of Aḏam
shall appear in the heaven, and then all the tribes of the earth shall mourn,
and they shall see the Son of Aḏam coming on the clouds of the heaven
with power and much esteem. 
Mat
24:31  “And He shall send His messengers
with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together His chosen ones
from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other. 
Mat
24:32  “And learn this parable from the
fig tree: When its branch has already become tender and puts forth leaves, you
know that the summer is near. 
Mat
24:33  “So you also, when you see all
these, know that He is near, at the doors. 
Mat
24:34  “Truly, I say to you, this
generation shall by no means pass away until all this takes place. 
Mat
24:35  “The heaven and the earth shall
pass away, but My words shall by no means pass away. 
Mat
24:36  “But concerning that day and the
hour no one knows, not even the messengers of the heavens, but My Father only.
Mat
24:37  “And as the days of Noaḥ, so
also shall the coming of the Son of Aḏam be. 
Mat
24:38  “For as they were in the days
before the flood, eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until
the day that Noaḥ entered into the ark, 
Mat
24:39  and they did not know until the
flood came and took them all away, so also shall the coming of the Son of Aḏam
be. 
Mat
24:40  “Then two shall be in the field,
the one is taken and the one is left. 
Mat
24:41  “Two shall be grinding at the
mill, one is taken and one is left. 
Mat
24:42  “Watch therefore, for you do not
know what hour your Master is coming. 
Mat
24:43  “And know this, that if the master
of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched
and not allowed his house to be broken into. 
Mat
24:44  “Because of this, be ready too,
for the Son of Aḏam is coming at an hour when you do not expect Him. 
Mat
24:45  “Who then is a trustworthy and
wise servant, whom his master set over his household, to give them food in
season? 
Mat
24:46  “Blessed is that servant whom his
master, having come, shall find so doing. 
Mat
24:47  “Truly, I say to you that he shall
set him over all his possessions. 
Mat
24:48  “But if that evil servant says in
his heart, ‘My master is delaying his coming,’ 
Mat
24:49  and begins to beat his fellow
servants, and to eat and drink with the drunkards, 
Mat
24:50  the master of that servant shall
come on a day when he does not expect it, and at an hour he does not know, 
Mat
24:51  and shall cut him in two and
appoint him his portion with the hypocrites – there shall be weeping and
gnashing of teeth. 
Mat
25:1  “Then the reign of the heavens
shall be compared to ten maidens who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.

Mat
25:2  “And five of them were wise, and
five foolish. 
Mat
25:3  “Those who were foolish, having
taken their lamps, took no oil with them, 
Mat
25:4  but the wise took oil in their
containers with their lamps. 
Mat
25:5  “Now while the bridegroom took
time, they all slumbered and slept. 
Mat
25:6  “And at midnight a cry was heard, ‘See,
the bridegroom is coming, go out to meet him!’ 
Mat
25:7  “Then all those maidens rose up and
trimmed their lamps. 
Mat
25:8  “And the foolish said to the wise, ‘Give
us of your oil, because our lamps are going out.’ 
Mat
25:9  “But the wise answered, saying, ‘No,
indeed, there would not be enough for us and you. Instead, go to those who
sell, and buy for yourselves.’ 
Mat
25:10  “And while they went to buy, the
bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the wedding
feast, and the door was shut. 
Mat
25:11  “And later the other maidens also
came, saying, ‘Master, Master, open up for us!’ 
Mat
25:12  “But he answering, said, ‘Truly, I
say to you, I do not know you.’ 
Mat
25:13  “Watch therefore, because you do
not know the day nor the hour in which the Son of Aḏam is coming, 
Mat
25:14  for it is like a man going from
home, who called his own servants and delivered his possessions to them. 
Mat
25:15  “And to one he gave five talents,
and to another two, and to another one, to each according to his own ability,
and went from home. 
Mat
25:16  “And he who had received the five
talents went and worked with them, and made another five talents. 
Mat
25:17  “In the same way, he with the two
also, he gained two more. 
Mat
25:18  “But he who had received the one
went away and dug in the ground, and hid the silver of his master. 
Mat
25:19  “And after a long time the master
of those servants came and settled accounts with them. 
Mat
25:20  “And he who had received five
talents came and brought five other talents, saying, ‘Master, you delivered to
me five talents. See, I have gained five more talents besides them.’ 
Mat
25:21  “And his master said to him, ‘Well
done, good and trustworthy servant. You were trustworthy over a little, I shall
set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master.’ 
Mat
25:22  “Then he who had received two
talents came and said, ‘Master, you delivered to me two talents. See, I have
gained two more talents besides them.’ 
Mat
25:23  “His master said to him, ‘Well
done, good and trustworthy servant. You were trustworthy over a little, I shall
set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master.’ 
Mat
25:24  “And the one who had received the
one talent also came and said, ‘Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping
where you have not sown, and gathering where you have not scattered seed, 
Mat
25:25  and being afraid, I went and hid
your talent in the ground. See, you have what is yours.’ 
Mat
25:26  “And his master answering, said to
him, ‘You wicked and lazy servant, you knew that I reap where I have not sown,
and gather where I have not scattered seed. 
Mat
25:27  ‘Then you should have put my
silver with the bankers, and at my coming I would have received back my own
with interest. 
Mat
25:28  ‘Therefore take away the talent
from him, and give it to him who possesses ten talents. 
Mat
25:29  ‘For to everyone who possesses,
more shall be given, and he shall have overflowingly; but from him who does not
possess, even what he possesses shall be taken away.
Mat
25:30  ‘And throw the worthless servant
out into the outer darkness – there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’ 
Mat
25:31  “And when the Son of Aḏam
comes in His esteem, and all the set-apart messengers with Him, then He shall
sit on the throne of His esteem. 
Mat
25:32  “And all the nations shall be
gathered before Him, and He shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd
separates his sheep from the goats. 
Mat
25:33  “And He shall set the sheep on His
right hand, but the goats on the left. 
Mat
25:34  “Then the Sovereign shall say to
those on His right hand, ‘Come, you blessed of My Father, inherit the reign
prepared for you from the foundation of the world – 
Mat
25:35  for I was hungry and you gave Me
food, I was thirsty and you gave Me drink, I was a stranger and you took Me in,

Mat
25:36  was naked and you clothed Me, I
was sick and you visited Me, I was in prison and you came to Me.’ 
Mat
25:37  “Then the righteous shall answer
Him, saying, ‘Master, when did we see You hungry and we fed You, or thirsty and gave You to drink? 
Mat
25:38  ‘And when did we see You a
stranger and took You in, or naked
and clothed You? 
Mat
25:39  ‘And when did we see You sick, or
in prison, and we came to You?’ 
Mat
25:40  “And the Sovereign shall answer
and say to them, ‘Truly, I say to you, in so far as you did it to one of the
least of these My brothers, you did it to Me.’ 
Mat
25:41  “He shall then also say to those
on the left hand, ‘Go away from Me, accursed ones, into the everlasting fire
prepared for the devil and his messengers – 
Mat
25:42  for I was hungry and you gave Me
no food, I was thirsty and you gave Me no drink, 
Mat
25:43  ‘I was a stranger and you did not
take Me in, was naked and you did not clothe Me, sick and in prison and you did
not visit Me.’ 
Mat
25:44  “Then they also shall answer Him,
saying, ‘Master, when did we see You hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked
or sick or in prison, and did not serve You?’ 
Mat
25:45  “Then He shall answer them,
saying, ‘Truly, I say to you, in so far as you did not do it to one of the
least of these, you did not do it to Me.’ 
Mat
25:46  “And these shall go away into
everlasting punishment, but the righteous into everlasting life.” 
Mat
26:1  And it came to be, when יהושע
ended all these words, He said to His taught ones, 
Mat
26:2  “You know that after two days the
Passover takes place, and the Son of Aḏam is to be delivered up to be
impaled.” 
Mat
26:3  Then the chief priests, and the
scribes, and the elders of the people came together at the court of the high
priest, who was called Qayapha, 
Mat
26:4  and plotted to seize יהושע
by trickery and kill Him. 
Mat
26:5  But they said, “Not at the festival
lest there be an uproar among the people.” 
Mat
26:6  And when יהושע
was in Bĕyth Anyah at the house of Shim‛on the leper, 
Mat
26:7  a woman came to Him, having an
alabaster flask of costly perfume, and she poured it on His head as He sat at
the table. 
Mat
26:8  And when His taught ones saw it,
they were much displeased saying, “To what purpose is this waste? 
Mat
26:9  “For this perfume could have been
sold for much and given to the poor.” 
Mat
26:10  However, when יהושע
noticed it, He said to them, “Why do you trouble the woman? For she has done a
good work toward Me. 
Mat
26:11  “For you always have the poor with
you, but Me you do not have always. 
Mat
26:12  “For in pouring this perfume on My
body, she did it for My burial. 
Mat
26:13  “Truly, I say to you, wherever
this Good News is proclaimed in all the world, what this woman has done shall
be spoken of also, to her remembrance.” 
Mat
26:14  Then one of the twelve, called
Yehuḏah from Qerioth, went to the chief priests, 
Mat
26:15  and said, “What would you give me
to deliver Him to you?” And they counted out to him thirty pieces of silver. 
Mat
26:16  And from then on he was seeking an
occasion to deliver Him up. 
Mat
26:17  And on the first day of Unleavened Bread the taught ones
came to יהושע, saying to Him, “Where do You wish
us to prepare for You to eat the Passover?” 
Mat
26:18  And He said, “Go into the city to
a certain man, and say to him, ‘The Teacher says, “My time is near. I am to observe
the Passover at your house with My taught ones.” ’ ” 
Mat
26:19  And the taught ones did as יהושע
had ordered them, and prepared the Passover. 
Mat
26:20  And when evening came, He sat down
with the twelve. 
Mat
26:21  And while they were eating, He
said, “Truly, I say to you, one of you shall deliver Me up.” 
Mat
26:22  And they were deeply grieved, and
began to say to Him, each of them, “Master, is it I?” 
Mat
26:23  And He answering, said, “He who
has dipped his hand with Me in the dish, he shall deliver Me up. 
Mat
26:24  “Indeed, the Son of Aḏam
goes as it has been written concerning Him, but woe to that man by whom the Son
of Aḏam is delivered up! It would have been good for that man if he had
not been born.” 
Mat
26:25  And Yehuḏah – he who delivered
Him up – answering, said, “Rabbi, is it I?” He said to him, “You have said it.”

Mat
26:26  And as they were eating, יהושע
took bread, and having blessed, broke and gave it to the taught ones and said, “Take,
eat, this is My body.” 
Mat
26:27  And taking the cup, and giving
thanks, He gave it to them, saying, “Drink from it, all of you. 
Mat
26:28  “For this is My blood, that of the
renewed covenant, which is shed for many for the forgiveness of sins. 
Mat
26:29  “But I say to you, I shall
certainly not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on till that day when I
drink it anew with you in the reign of My Father.” 
Mat
26:30  And having sung a song, they went
out to the Mount of Olives. 
Mat
26:31  Then יהושע
said to them, “All of you shall stumble in Me this night, for it has been
written, ‘I shall strike the Shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be
scattered.’
Mat
26:32  “But after I have been raised, I
shall go before you into Galil.” 
Mat
26:33  And Kĕpha answering, said to
Him, “Even if all stumble in You, I shall never stumble.” 
Mat
26:34  יהושע
said to him, “Truly, I say to you that this night, before the cock crows, you
shall deny Me three times.” 
Mat
26:35  Kĕpha said to Him, “Even if I
have to die with You, I shall not deny You!” All the taught ones said the same
too. 
Mat
26:36  Then יהושע
came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to the taught ones, “Sit
here while I go over there and pray.” 
Mat
26:37  And He took with Him Kĕpha
and the two sons of Zaḇdai, and He began to be grieved and deeply
distressed. 
Mat
26:38  Then He said to them, “My being is
exceedingly grieved, even to death. Stay here and watch with Me.” 
Mat
26:39  And going forward a little, He
fell on His face, and prayed, saying, “O My Father, if it is possible, let this
cup pass from Me. Yet not as I desire, but as You desire.” 
Mat
26:40  And He came to the taught ones and
found them asleep, and said to Kĕpha, “So, were you not able to watch with
Me one hour? 
Mat
26:41  “Watch and pray, lest you enter into
trial. The spirit indeed is eager, but the flesh is weak.” 
Mat
26:42  Again He went away, a second time,
and prayed, saying, “O My Father, if it is impossible for this to pass unless I
drink it, let Your desire be done.” 
Mat
26:43  And He came and found them asleep
again, for their eyes were heavy. 
Mat
26:44  And He left them, went away again,
and prayed the third time, saying the same words. 
Mat
26:45  Then He came to His taught ones
and said to them, “Still sleeping and taking rest? See, the hour has come near,
and the Son of Aḏam is delivered up into the hands of sinners. 
Mat
26:46  “Rise, let us go. See, he who
delivers Me up has come near.” 
Mat
26:47  And while He was still speaking,
see, Yehuḏah, one of the twelve, with a large crowd with swords and
clubs, came from the chief priests and elders of the people. 
Mat
26:48  And he who was delivering Him up
gave them a sign, saying, “Whomever I kiss, it is He, seize Him.” 
Mat
26:49  And going straight up to יהושע
he said, “Greetings, Rabbi!” and kissed Him. 
Mat
26:50  And יהושע
said to him, “Friend, why have you come?” Then they came and laid hands on יהושע
and seized Him. 
Mat
26:51  And look, one of those with יהושע
put out his hand and drew his sword, and striking the servant of the high
priest he cut off his ear. 
Mat
26:52  Then יהושע
said to him, “Return your sword to its place, for all who take the sword shall
die by the sword. 
Mat
26:53  “Or do you think that I am not
able to pray to My Father now, and He shall provide Me with more than twelve
legions of messengers? 
Mat
26:54  “How then would the Scriptures be
filled that it has to be this way?” 
Mat
26:55  In that hour יהושע
said to the crowds, “Have you come out, as against a robber, with swords and
clubs to arrest Me? Daily I sat with you, teaching in the Set-apart Place, and
you did not seize Me. 
Mat
26:56  “But all this came to be, so that
the Scriptures of the prophets might be filled.” Then all the taught ones left
Him and fled. 
Mat
26:57  And those who had seized יהושע
led Him away to Qayapha the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were
gathered together. 
Mat
26:58  But Kĕpha followed Him at a
distance to the courtyard of the high priest, and he went in and sat with the
servants to see the end. 
Mat
26:59  And the chief priests, and the
elders, and all the council were seeking false witness against יהושע
to put Him to death, 
Mat
26:60  but found none. Although many
false witnesses came forward, they found none. But at last two false witnesses
came forward, 
Mat
26:61  and said, “This one said, ‘I am
able to destroy the Dwelling Place of Elohim and to build it in three days.’ ” 
Mat
26:62  And the high priest stood up and
said to Him, “Have You no answer to make? What do these witness against You?” 
Mat
26:63  But יהושע
remained silent. So the high priest said to Him, “I put You to oath, by the
living Elohim that You say to us if You are the Messiah, the Son of Elohim.” 
Mat
26:64  יהושע
said to him, “You have said it. Besides I say to you, from now you shall see
the Son of Aḏam sitting at the right hand of the Power, and coming on the
clouds of the heaven.” 
Mat
26:65  Then the high priest tore his
garments, saying, “He has blasphemed! Why do we need any more witnesses? See,
now you have heard His blasphemy! 
Mat
26:66  “What do you think?” And they
answering, said, “He is liable to death.” 
Mat
26:67  Then they spat in His face and
beat Him, and others slapped Him, 
Mat
26:68  saying, “Prophesy to us, Messiah!
Who is the one who struck You?” 
Mat
26:69  And Kĕpha sat outside in the
courtyard, and a servant girl came to him, saying, “And you were with יהושע
of Galil.” 
Mat
26:70  But he denied it before them all,
saying, “I do not know what you say.” 
Mat
26:71  And as he was going out into the
porch, another girl saw him and said to those there, “And this one was with יהושע
of Natsareth.” 
Mat
26:72  But again he denied with an oath, “I
do not know the Man!” 
Mat
26:73  And after a while those who stood
by came to him and said to Kĕpha, “Truly you are one of them too, for even
your speech gives you away.” 
Mat
26:74  Then he began to curse and to
swear, saying, “I do not know the Man!” And immediately a cock crowed. 
Mat
26:75  And Kĕpha remembered the word
of יהושע who had said to him, “Before a cock
crows, you shall deny Me three times.” And going out, he wept bitterly. 
Mat
27:1  And morning having come, all the
chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against יהושע,
so as to put Him to death. 
Mat
27:2  And having bound Him, they led Him
away and delivered Him to Pontius Pilate the governor. 
Mat
27:3  Then Yehuḏah – he who
delivered Him up – having seen that He had been condemned, repented, returned
the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and to the elders, 
Mat
27:4  saying, “I have sinned in
delivering up innocent blood.” And they said, “What is that to us? You see to
it!” 
Mat
27:5  And throwing down the pieces of
silver in the Dwelling Place he left, and went and hanged himself. 
Mat
27:6  And the chief priests took the
silver pieces and said, “It is not right to put them into the treasury, seeing
they are the price of blood.” 
Mat
27:7  So they took counsel and bought
with them the potter’s field, for the burial of strangers. 
Mat
27:8  Therefore that field has been
called the Field of Blood, until today. 
Mat
27:9  Then was filled what was spoken by
Yirmeyahu the prophet, saying, “And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the
price of Him who was pierced, on whom they of the children of Yisra’ĕl set
a price, 
Mat
27:10  and gave them for the potter’s
field, as יהוה had ordered me.” 
Mat
27:11  And יהושע
stood before the governor, and the governor asked Him, saying, “Are You the
Sovereign of the Yehuḏim?” And יהושע said
to him, “You say it.” 
Mat
27:12  And as He was accused by the chief
priests and the elders, He answered not. 
Mat
27:13  Then Pilate said to Him, “Do You
not hear how much they witness against You?” 
Mat
27:14  And He did not answer him, not one
word, so that the governor wondered much. 
Mat
27:15  And at the festival the governor
used to release to the crowd one prisoner whom they wished. 
Mat
27:16  And they had then a well-known
prisoner called Barabba. 
Mat
27:17  So when they were assembled,
Pilate said to them, “Whom do you wish I release to you? Barabba, or יהושע
who is called Messiah?” 
Mat
27:18  For he knew that because of envy
they had delivered Him up. 
Mat
27:19  And as he was sitting on the
judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, “Have none at all to do with that
righteous Man, for I have suffered much today in a dream because of Him.” 
Mat
27:20  But the chief priests and elders
persuaded the crowds that they should ask for Barabba and to destroy יהושע.

Mat
27:21  And the governor answering, said
to them, “Which of the two do you wish I release to you?” They said, “Barabba!”

Mat
27:22  Pilate said to them, “What then
shall I do with יהושע who is called Messiah?”
They all said to him, “Let Him be impaled!” 
Mat
27:23  And the governor said, “Indeed,
what evil has He done?” And they were crying out all the more, saying, “Let Him
be impaled!” 
Mat
27:24  And when Pilate saw that he was
getting nowhere, but rather an uproar was starting, he took water and washed
his hands before the crowd, saying, “I am innocent of the blood of this
Righteous One. You shall see to it.” 
Mat
27:25  And all the people answering,
said, “His blood be on us and on our children.” 
Mat
27:26  Then he released Barabba to them,
but having יהושע whipped, he delivered Him over
to be impaled. 
Mat
27:27  Then the soldiers of the governor
took יהושע into the court and gathered the entire
company of soldiers around Him. 
Mat
27:28  And having stripped Him, they put
a scarlet robe on Him. 
Mat
27:29  And plaiting a crown of thorns,
they put it on His head, and a reed in His right hand. And they kneeled down
before Him and mocked Him, saying, “Greetings, Sovereign of the Yehuḏim!”

Mat
27:30  And spitting on Him they took the
reed and struck Him on the head. 
Mat
27:31  And when they had mocked Him, they
took the robe off Him, then put His own garments on Him, and led Him away to be
impaled. 
Mat
27:32  And as they were going out, they
found a man of Cyrene, Shim‛on by name – they compelled him to bear His stake.

Mat
27:33  And when they came to a place
called Golgotha, that is to say, Place of a Skull, 
Mat
27:34  they gave Him wine mixed with bile
to drink. And after tasting, He would not drink it. 
Mat
27:35  And having impaled Him, they
divided His garments, casting lots, that it might be filled what was spoken by
the prophet, “They divided My garments among them, and for My clothing they
cast lots.” 
Mat
27:36  And sitting down, they guarded Him
there. 
Mat
27:37  And they put up over His head the
written charge against Him: THIS IS יהושע, THE
SOVEREIGN OF THE YEHUḎIM. 
Mat
27:38  Then two robbers were impaled with
Him, one on the right and another on the left. 
Mat
27:39  And those passing by were
blaspheming Him, shaking their heads, 
Mat
27:40  and saying, “You who destroy the
Dwelling Place and build it in three days, save Yourself! If You are the Son of
Elohim, come down from the stake.” 
Mat
27:41  And likewise the chief priests,
with the scribes and elders, mocking, said, 
Mat
27:42  “He saved others – He is unable to
save Himself. If He is the Sovereign of Yisra’ĕl, let Him now come down
from the stake, and we shall believe Him. 
Mat
27:43  “He trusted in Elohim, let Him
rescue Him now if He desires Him, for He said, ‘I am the Son of Elohim.’ ” 
Mat
27:44  And also the robbers who were
impaled with Him reviled Him, saying
the same. 
Mat
27:45  And from the sixth hour there was
darkness over all the land, until the ninth hour. 
Mat
27:46  And about the ninth hour יהושע
cried out with a loud voice, saying, “Ĕli, Ĕli, lemah sheḇaqtani?”
that is, “My Ĕl, My Ĕl, why have You forsaken Me?” 
Mat
27:47  Some of those standing there,
having heard, said, “This One calls Ĕliyahu!” 
Mat
27:48  And immediately one of them ran
and took a sponge, and filled it with sour wine and put it on a reed, and gave
it to Him to drink. 
Mat
27:49  But the rest said, “Leave it, let
us see if Ĕliyahu comes to save Him.” 
Mat
27:50  And יהושע
cried out again with a loud voice, and gave up His spirit. 
Mat
27:51  And see, the veil of the Dwelling
Place was torn in two from top to bottom, and the earth was shaken, and the
rocks were split, 
Mat
27:52  and the tombs were opened, and
many bodies of the set-apart ones who had fallen asleep were raised, 
Mat
27:53  and coming out of the tombs after
His resurrection, they went into the set-apart city and appeared to many. 
Mat
27:54  And when the captain and those
with him, who were guarding יהושע, saw the
earthquake and all that took place, they feared exceedingly, saying, “Truly
this was the Son of Elohim!” 
Mat
27:55  And many women who followed יהושע
from Galil, attending Him, were there, watching from a distance, 
Mat
27:56  among whom were Miryam from Maḡdala,
and Miryam the mother of Ya‛aqoḇ and Yosĕph, and the mother of
Zaḇdai’s sons. 
Mat
27:57  And when evening came, there came
a rich man from Ramathayim, named Yosĕph, who himself had also become a
taught one of יהושע. 
Mat
27:58  He went to Pilate and asked for
the body of יהושע. Then Pilate commanded the body
to be given. 
Mat
27:59  And having taken the body, Yosĕph
wrapped it in clean linen, 
Mat
27:60  and laid it in his new tomb which
he had hewn out of the rock. And he rolled a large stone against the door of
the tomb, and went away. 
Mat
27:61  And Miryam from Maḡdala was
there, and the other Miryam, sitting opposite the tomb. 
Mat
27:62  On the next day, which was after
the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees gathered together to Pilate, 
Mat
27:63  saying, “Master, we remember,
while He was still alive, how that deceiver said, ‘After three days I am
raised.’ 
Mat
27:64  “Command, then, that the tomb be
safeguarded until the third day, lest His taught ones come by night and steal
Him away, and should say to the people, ‘He was raised from the dead.’ And the
last deception shall be worse than the first.” 
Mat
27:65  So Pilate said to them, “You have
a watch, go, safeguard it as you know how.” 
Mat
27:66  And they went and safeguarded the
tomb, sealing the stone and setting the watch. 
Mat
28:1  Now after the Sabbath, toward dawn
on the first day of the week, Miryam from Maḡdala and the other Miryam
came to see the tomb.
Mat
28:2  And see, there was a great
earthquake, for a messenger of יהוה came down out of
heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat on it. 
Mat
28:3  And his appearance was like
lightning, and his garments as white as snow. 
Mat
28:4  And the guards trembled for fear of
him, and became like dead men. 
Mat
28:5  And the messenger responding, said
to the women, “Do not be afraid, for I know that you seek יהושע
who was impaled. 
Mat
28:6  “He is not here, for He was raised,
as He said. Come, see the place where the Master lay. 
Mat
28:7  “And go quickly, say to His taught
ones that He was raised from the dead, and see, He is going before you to
Galil. There you shall see Him. See, I have told you.” 
Mat
28:8  And they left the tomb quickly,
with fear and great joy, and ran to report to His taught ones. 
Mat
28:9  And as they were going to report to
His taught ones, see, יהושע met them, saying, “Greetings!”
And they came and held Him by the feet and did bow to Him. 
Mat
28:10  Then יהושע
said to them, “Do not be afraid. Go, report to My brothers, to go to Galil, and
they shall see Me there.” 
Mat
28:11  And while they were going, see,
some of the watch having gone into the city, reported to the chief priests all
that took place. 
Mat
28:12  And when they came together with
the elders and taken counsel, they gave enough silver to the soldiers, 
Mat
28:13  saying, “Say that His taught ones
came at night and stole Him away while we slept. 
Mat
28:14  “And if this should be reported to
the governor, we shall win him over and keep you out of trouble.” 
Mat
28:15  And having taken the silver they
did as they were instructed. And this account was widely spread among the Yehuḏim,
to this day. 
Mat
28:16  And the eleven taught ones went
away into Galil, to the mountain which יהושע had
appointed for them. 
Mat
28:17  And when they saw Him, they bowed
to Him, but some doubted. 
Mat
28:18  And יהושע
came up and spoke to them, saying, “All authority has been given to Me in
heaven and on earth. 
Mat
28:19  “Therefore, go and make taught
ones of all the nations, immersing them in the Name of the Father and of the
Son and of the Set-apart Spirit, 
Mat
28:20  teaching them to guard all that I
have commanded you. And see, I am with you always, until the end of the age.”
Amĕn.
