Qorintiyim Bĕt/2 Corinthians
2Cor
1:1  Sha’ul, an emissary of יהושע
Messiah, by the desire of Elohim, and Timothy the brother, to the assembly of
Elohim that is at Corinth, with all the set-apart ones who are in all Achaia: 
2Cor
1:2  Favour to you and peace from Elohim
our Father and the Master יהושע Messiah. 
2Cor
1:3  Blessed be the Elohim and Father of
our Master יהושע Messiah, the Father of
compassion and Elohim of all comfort, 
2Cor
1:4  who is comforting us in all our
pressure, enabling us to comfort those who are in every pressure, through the
comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by Elohim. 
2Cor
1:5  Because, as the sufferings of
Messiah overflow in us, so our comfort also overflows through Messiah. 
2Cor
1:6  And if we suffer pressure, it is for
your comfort and deliverance, being worked out in enduring the same sufferings
which we also suffer. If we are comforted, it is for your comfort and
deliverance. 
2Cor
1:7  And our expectation for you is
steadfast, because we know that as you are sharing in the sufferings – so also
in the comfort. 
2Cor
1:8  For we do not wish you to be
ignorant, brothers, of our pressure which came to us in Asia, that we were
weighed down, exceedingly, beyond ability, so that we despaired even of life.
2Cor
1:9  Indeed, we had the sentence of death
in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves but in Elohim who raises
the dead, 
2Cor
1:10  who rescued us from so great a
death, and does rescue, in whom we trust that He shall still rescue us, 
2Cor
1:11  you also helping together in prayer
for us, that thanks shall be given by many on our behalf for the favour
bestowed upon us through many. 
2Cor
1:12  For our boasting is this: the
witness of our conscience that we behaved ourselves in the world in simplicity
and sincerity of Elohim, not in fleshly wisdom but in the favour of Elohim, and
much more toward you. 
2Cor
1:13  For we are not writing any other matters to you than what you read or
understand. Now I trust you shall understand, even to the end, 
2Cor
1:14  as also you have understood us in
part, that we are your boast as you also are ours, in the day of the Master יהושע.

2Cor
1:15  And relying on this I intended to
come to you before, that you might twice receive a favour, 
2Cor
1:16  and to pass your way into
Makedonia, and again from Makedonia come to you, and to be sent by you on my
way to Yehuḏah. 
2Cor
1:17  Since I intended this, did I do it
lightly? Or what I plan, do I plan according to the flesh, that with me there
should be Yea, Yea, and No, No? 
2Cor
1:18  But Elohim is trustworthy, that our
word to you was not Yea and No. 
2Cor
1:19  For the Son of Elohim, יהושע
Messiah, who was proclaimed among you by us – by me, Sila, and Timothy – was
not Yea and No, but in Him was Yea. 
2Cor
1:20  For as many promises as are of
Elohim, in Him they are Yea, and in Him Amĕn, to the esteem of Elohim
through us. 
2Cor
1:21  But He who establishes us with you
in Messiah and has anointed us is Elohim, 
2Cor
1:22  who also sealed us, and gave the
Spirit in our hearts as a pledge. 
2Cor
1:23  And I call Elohim as witness
against my being, that to spare you I came no more to Corinth. 
2Cor
1:24  Not that we rule over your belief,
but we are fellow workers for your joy, for you stand by belief. 
2Cor
2:1  And I decided this within myself,
not to come to you again in sadness. 
2Cor
2:2  For if I make you sad, then who is
he who makes me glad but the one who is made sad by me? 
2Cor
2:3  And I wrote to you as I did, so that
having come, I might not have sadness over those from whom I should have joy,
trusting in you all that my joy is that of you all. 
2Cor
2:4  For out of much pressure and
distress of heart I wrote to you, with many tears, not that you should be sad,
but that you might know the love which I so richly have for you. 
2Cor
2:5  But if anyone has caused sadness, he
has not made me sad, but in some degree you all – not to be too harsh. 
2Cor
2:6  For such a one this punishment, by
the many, is sufficient, 
2Cor
2:7  so that, on the contrary, you should
rather forgive and comfort, lest somehow such a one be swallowed up with too
much sadness. 
2Cor
2:8  So I appeal to you to confirm your
love to him. 
2Cor
2:9  Besides, I wrote for this purpose
also, that I might know the proof of you, if you are obedient in all matters. 
2Cor
2:10  And whom you forgive any matter, I do also. For indeed, if I have
forgiven any matter, I have forgiven
that one for your sakes in the sight of Messiah, 
2Cor
2:11  lest Satan should take advantage of
us, for we are not ignorant of his thoughts. 
2Cor
2:12  And when I came to Troas for the
Good News of Messiah, and a door was opened to me by the Master, 
2Cor
2:13  I had no rest in my spirit, because
I did not find Titus my brother. But taking my leave of them, I went on to
Makedonia. 
2Cor
2:14  But thanks be to Elohim who always
leads us on, to overcome in Messiah, and manifests through us the fragrance of
His knowledge in every place. 
2Cor
2:15  Because we are to Elohim the
fragrance of Messiah among those who are being saved and among those who are
perishing. 
2Cor
2:16  To the one we are the smell of
death to death, and to the other the fragrance of life to life. And who is
competent for these? 
2Cor
2:17  For we are not, as so many,
adulterating the Word of Elohim for gain
– but as of sincerity, but as from Elohim, in the sight of Elohim, we speak in
Messiah. 
2Cor
3:1  Are we to begin to recommend
ourselves again? Or do we need, as some, letters of recommendation to you, or
from you? 
2Cor
3:2  You are our letter, having been
written in our hearts, known and read by all men, 
2Cor
3:3  making it obvious that you are a
letter of Messiah, served by us, written not with ink but by the Spirit of the
living Elohim, not on tablets of stone but on fleshly tablets of the heart. 
2Cor
3:4  And such trust we have toward
Elohim, through the Messiah. 
2Cor
3:5  Not that we are competent in
ourselves to reckon any matter as
from ourselves, but our competence is from Elohim, 
2Cor
3:6  who also made us competent as
servants of a renewed covenant, not of the letter but of the Spirit, for the
letter kills but the Spirit gives life. 
2Cor
3:7  But if the administering of death in
letters, engraved on stones, was esteemed, so that the children of Yisra’ĕl
were unable to look steadily at the face of Mosheh because of the esteem of his
face, which was passing away, 
2Cor
3:8  how much more esteemed shall the
administering of the Spirit not be? 
2Cor
3:9  For if the administering of
condemnation had esteem, the administering of righteousness exceeds much more
in esteem. 
2Cor
3:10  For indeed what was made esteemed
had no esteem in this respect, in view of the esteem that excels. 
2Cor
3:11  For if that which is passing away
was esteemed, much more that which remains in esteem. 
2Cor
3:12  Having then such expectation, we
use much boldness of speech, 
2Cor
3:13  and not like Mosheh, who put a veil
over his face so that the children of Yisra’ĕl should not look steadily at
the end of what was passing away. 
2Cor
3:14  But their minds were hardened, for
to this day, when the old covenant is being read, that same veil remains, not
lifted, because in Messiah it is taken away. 
2Cor
3:15  But to this day, when Mosheh is
being read, a veil lies on their heart. 
2Cor
3:16  And when one turns to the Master,
the veil is taken away. 
2Cor
3:17  Now יהוה is
the Spirit, and where the Spirit of יהוה is, there is
freedom. 
2Cor
3:18  And we all, as with unveiled face
we see as in a mirror the esteem of יהוה, are being
transformed into the same likeness from esteem to esteem, as from יהוה,
the Spirit. 
2Cor
4:1  Therefore, having this service, even
as we received compassion, we do not lose heart, 
2Cor
4:2  but have renounced the secret ways of shame, not walking in craftiness
nor falsifying the Word of Elohim, but by the manifestation of the truth
recommending ourselves to every human conscience, in the sight of Elohim. 
2Cor
4:3  And indeed, if our Good News has
been veiled, it has been veiled in those who are perishing, 
2Cor
4:4  in whom the mighty one of this age
has blinded the minds of the unbelieving, so that the enlightening of the Good
News of the esteem of Messiah, who is the likeness of Elohim, does not shine on
them.
2Cor
4:5  For we do not proclaim ourselves,
but Messiah יהושע the Master, and ourselves your
servants for the sake of יהושע. 
2Cor
4:6  For Elohim, who said, “Let light
shine out of darkness,” is the One who has shone in our hearts for the
enlightening of the knowledge of the esteem of Elohim in the face of יהושע
Messiah. 
2Cor
4:7  And we have this treasure in earthen
vessels, so that the excellence of the power might be of Elohim, and not of us –

2Cor
4:8  being hard pressed on every side,
but not crushed; being perplexed, but not in despair;
2Cor
4:9  being persecuted, but not forsaken;
being thrown down, but not destroyed; 
2Cor
4:10  always bearing about in the body
the dying of the Master יהושע, that the life of יהושע
might also be manifested in our body. 
2Cor
4:11  For we, the living, are always
delivered to death for the sake of יהושע, that
the life of יהושע might also be manifested in our
mortal flesh, 
2Cor
4:12  so that death indeed is working in
us, but the life in you. 
2Cor
4:13  But having the same spirit of
belief, according to what has been written, “I believed, therefore I spoke,” we
also believe, therefore we also speak, 
2Cor
4:14  knowing that He who raised up the
Master יהושע shall also raise us up through יהושע,
and shall present us with you. 
2Cor
4:15  For all this is for your sake, so
that favour, having spread through the many, would cause thanksgiving to
overflow, unto the esteem of Elohim. 
2Cor
4:16  Therefore we do not lose heart, but
even if our outward man is perishing, the inward man is being renewed day by
day. 
2Cor
4:17  For this slight momentary pressure,
is working for us a far more exceeding and everlasting weight of esteem. 
2Cor
4:18  We are not looking on what is seen,
but on what is not seen. For what is seen passes away, but what is not seen is
everlasting.
2Cor
5:1  For we know that if the tent of our
earthly house, is destroyed, we have a building from Elohim, a house not made
with hands, everlasting in the heavens. 
2Cor
5:2  For indeed in this we groan, longing
to put on our dwelling which is from heaven, 
2Cor
5:3  so that, having put it on, we shall
not be found naked. 
2Cor
5:4  For indeed, we who are in this tent
groan, being burdened, not because we wish to put it off, but to put on the other, so that what is to die might
be swallowed up by life. 
2Cor
5:5  Now He who has prepared us for this
same purpose is Elohim, who has given us the Spirit as a pledge of what is to
come. 
2Cor
5:6  Therefore, being always of good
courage, and knowing that while we are at home in the body we are absent from
the Master – 
2Cor
5:7  for we walk by belief, not by sight –
2Cor
5:8  we are of good courage, and are well
pleased rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the Master. 
2Cor
5:9  So we also make it our aim to be
well-pleasing to Him, whether being at home, or being away from home. 
2Cor
5:10  For we all have to appear before
the judgment seat of Messiah, in order for each one to receive according to
what he has done in the body, whether good or evil.
2Cor
5:11  Knowing, therefore, the fear of יהוה,
we persuade men, but we have been made manifest to Elohim, and I also trust in
your consciences to have been manifested. 
2Cor
5:12  For we do not again commend
ourselves to you, but give you an occasion to boast on our behalf, in order
that you have an answer for those who
take pride in appearance and not in heart. 
2Cor
5:13  For whether we are beside
ourselves, it was for Elohim, or whether we are of sound mind, it is for you. 
2Cor
5:14  For the love of Messiah compels us,
having judged this: that if One died for all, then all died; 
2Cor
5:15  and He died for all, that those who
live should no longer live for themselves, but for Him who died for them, and
was raised.
2Cor
5:16  So from now onwards we know no one
according to the flesh. And if we have known Messiah according to the flesh,
yet now we no longer know Him thus. 
2Cor
5:17  Therefore, if anyone is in Messiah,
he is a renewed creature – the old matters have passed away, see, all matters have become renewed!
2Cor
5:18  And all matters are from Elohim, who has restored us to favour with Himself
through יהושע Messiah, and has given us the
service of restoration to favour, 
2Cor
5:19  that is, that Elohim was in Messiah
restoring the world to favour unto Himself, not reckoning their trespasses to
them, and has committed to us the word of restoration to favour. 
2Cor
5:20  Therefore we are envoys on behalf
of Messiah, as though Elohim were pleading through us. We beg, on behalf of
Messiah: Be restored to favour with Elohim. 
2Cor
5:21  For He made Him who knew no sin to
be sin for us, so that in Him we might become the righteousness of Elohim. 
2Cor
6:1  And working together, we also call
upon you not to receive the favour of Elohim in vain – 
2Cor
6:2  For He says, “In an acceptable time
I have heard you, and in a day of deliverance I have helped you.” See, now is
the well-accepted time, see, now is a day of deliverance – 
2Cor
6:3  giving no cause of stumbling in
whatever, so that the service is not blamed. 
2Cor
6:4  Rather, we commend ourselves as
servants of Elohim in every way: in much endurance, in pressures, in hardships,
in distresses, 
2Cor
6:5  in stripes, in imprisonments, in
disturbances, in toils, in watchings, in fastings, 
2Cor
6:6  in cleanness, in knowledge, in
patience, in kindness, in the Set-apart Spirit, in love unfeigned, 
2Cor
6:7  in the word of truth, in the power
of Elohim, through the weapons of righteousness, on the right and on the left, 
2Cor
6:8  through esteem and disrespect,
through evil report and good report; regarded
as deceivers, and yet true; 
2Cor
6:9  as unknown, and yet well-known; as
dying, and see, we live; as disciplined, and yet not killed; 
2Cor
6:10  as sad, yet always rejoicing; as
poor, yet enriching many; as having none, and yet possessing all. 
2Cor
6:11  Our mouth has spoken openly to you,
O Corinthians, our heart is wide open. 
2Cor
6:12  You are not restrained by us, but
you are restrained by your own affections. 
2Cor
6:13  But for the same reward – I speak
as to children – open wide your hearts
too. 
2Cor
6:14  Do not become unevenly yoked with
unbelievers. For what partnership have righteousness and lawlessness? And what
fellowship has light with darkness? 
2Cor
6:15  And what agreement has Messiah with
Beliya‛al? Or what part does a believer have with an unbeliever? 
2Cor
6:16  And what union has the Dwelling
Place of Elohim with idols? For you are a Dwelling Place of the living Elohim,
as Elohim has said, “I shall dwell in them and walk among them, and I shall be
their Elohim, and they shall be My people.” 
2Cor
6:17  Therefore, “Come out from among
them and be separate, says יהוה, and do not touch what
is unclean, and I shall receive you. 
2Cor
6:18  “And I shall be a Father to you,
and you shall be sons and daughters to Me, says יהוה
the Almighty.” 
2Cor
7:1  Having, then, these promises,
beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of the flesh and spirit,
perfecting set-apartness in the fear of Elohim. 
2Cor
7:2  Make room for us, we wronged no one,
we corrupted no one, we exploited no one. 
2Cor
7:3  I do not say this to condemn, for I
previously said that you are in our hearts, to die together and to live
together. 
2Cor
7:4  Great is my boldness of speech
toward you, great is my boasting on your behalf. I have been filled with encouragement,
I overflow with joy in all our pressure. 
2Cor
7:5  For, indeed, when we came into
Makedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were hard pressed on every side –
conflicts without, fears within. 
2Cor
7:6  But Elohim, who encourages the
downcast, encouraged us by the coming of Titus, 
2Cor
7:7  and not only by his coming, but also
by the encouragement with which he was encouraged over you, when he reported to
us your longing, your mourning, your ardour for me, so that I greatly rejoiced.

2Cor
7:8  For even if I made you sad with my
letter, I do not regret it, though I did regret it. For I perceive that the
same letter made you sad, even if for an hour. 
2Cor
7:9  I now rejoice, not that you were
made sad, but that you were saddened into repenting. For you were made sad
according to Elohim, so that you suffered no loss from us. 
2Cor
7:10  For sadness according to Elohim
works repentance to deliverance, not to be regretted, but the sadness of the
world works death. 
2Cor
7:11  For see how you have been saddened
according to Elohim – how much it worked out in you eagerness; indeed, clearing
of yourselves; indeed, displeasure; indeed, fear; indeed, longing; indeed,
ardour; indeed, righting of wrong! In every way you proved yourselves to be
clear in the matter. 
2Cor
7:12  So although I wrote to you, it was
not for the sake of him who had done the wrong, nor for the sake of him who
suffered wrong, but for the sake of revealing our diligence for you, before
Elohim . 
2Cor
7:13  For this reason we have been
encouraged in your encouragement. And we rejoiced exceedingly more for the joy
of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by all of you. 
2Cor
7:14  Because if I have boasted somewhat
about you to him, I am not ashamed. But as we spoke to you in all truth, even
so our boasting to Titus was found true. 
2Cor
7:15  And his tender feelings are greater
for you as he remembers the obedience of all of you, as you received him with
fear and trembling. 
2Cor
7:16  I rejoice that in every way I am of
good courage by reason of you. 
2Cor
8:1  Now brothers, we make known to you
the favour of Elohim which has been given in the assemblies of Makedonia: 
2Cor
8:2  that in much trial of pressure the
overflowing of their joy and their deep poverty overflowed into the riches of
their generosity. 
2Cor
8:3  Because I bear witness that
according to their ability, and beyond their ability, they gave voluntarily, 
2Cor
8:4  begging us with much urgency for the
favour of taking part in this service to the set-apart ones. 
2Cor
8:5  And, not as we had expected, they
gave themselves first to the Master, and then to us by the desire of Elohim, 
2Cor
8:6  that we should urge Titus, that as
he had begun, so he would also complete this kind gift in you as well. 
2Cor
8:7  But as you excel in every way – in
belief, and speech, and knowledge, and all diligence, and in your love for us –
that you should excel in this kind gift as well. 
2Cor
8:8  I speak not by command, but I am
proving the genuineness of your love by the eagerness of others. 
2Cor
8:9  For you know the favour of our
Master יהושע Messiah, that being rich, He became
poor for your sake, so that you might become rich through His poverty. 
2Cor
8:10  And in this I give an opinion: It
is to your advantage not only to be doing what you began and were desiring to
do a year ago, 
2Cor
8:11  and now also complete the work,
that as there was a readiness in
desiring it, so there also should be
a completion out of what you have. 
2Cor
8:12  For if the readiness is present, it
is well received according to what one has, not according to what he does not
have – 
2Cor
8:13  not, however, that others should be
eased and you hard pressed, 
2Cor
8:14  but by fair sharing, that now at
this time your plenty for their need, so that their plenty might also be for
your need – that there might be fair sharing. 
2Cor
8:15  As it has been written, “He who gathered much did not have too much, and
he who gathered little had not less.”

2Cor
8:16  But thanks be to Elohim who puts
the same eagerness for you into the heart of Titus. 
2Cor
8:17  Because he received the appeal,
indeed, but being more eager, he went to you of his own accord. 
2Cor
8:18  And we sent with him the brother
whose praise is in the Good News through all the assemblies, 
2Cor
8:19  and not only so, but who was also
chosen by the assemblies to travel with us with this gift that is administered
by us to the esteem of the Master Himself, and your ready mind, 
2Cor
8:20  avoiding this: that anyone should
blame us in this generous gift which is administered by us. 
2Cor
8:21  For we provide what is right, not
only in the sight of יהוה, but also in the sight of
men. 
2Cor
8:22  And we sent with them our brother
whom we have often proved eager in many ways, but now much more eager, because
of the great reliance which we have in you. 
2Cor
8:23  As for Titus, he is my partner and
fellow worker for you. As for our brothers, they
are messengers of the assemblies, the esteem of Messiah. 
2Cor
8:24  Therefore show to them the proof of
your love and of our boasting on your behalf, and in the presence of the
assemblies. 
2Cor
9:1  Indeed, concerning the service to
the set-apart ones, it is unnecessary for me to write to you; 
2Cor
9:2  for I know your eagerness, about
which I boast of you to the Makedonians, that Achaia was ready a year ago. And
your ardour has stirred up most of them. 
2Cor
9:3  But I sent the brothers, lest our
boasting on behalf of you should be made empty in this part, in order that, as
I said, you were ready, 
2Cor
9:4  lest if some Makedonians come with
me and find you not ready, we – not to speak of you – should be put to shame
because of our belief. 
2Cor
9:5  So I thought it necessary to appeal
to the brothers to come to you in advance, and arrange your promised blessing
beforehand – this to be ready as a blessing and not as greediness. 
2Cor
9:6  And this: He who sows sparingly
shall also reap sparingly, and he who sows on blessing shall also reap on
blessing. 
2Cor
9:7  Let each one give as he purposes in his heart, not of grief or of necessity, for
Elohim loves a joyous giver. 
2Cor
9:8  And Elohim is able to make all
favour overflow toward you, that you, always having all you need in every way,
have plenty for every good work. 
2Cor
9:9  As it has been written, “He
scattered abroad, He gave to the poor, His righteousness remains forever.” 
2Cor
9:10  And He who supplies seed to the
sower, and bread for food, shall supply and increase the seed you have sown and
increase the fruit of your righteousness, 
2Cor
9:11  being enriched in every way for all
simplicity, which works out thanksgiving to Elohim through us. 
2Cor
9:12  Because the rendering of this
service not only supplies the needs of the set-apart ones, but also is
overflowing through many thanksgivings to Elohim. 
2Cor
9:13  Through the proof of this service,
they esteem Elohim on the submission of your confession to the Good News of
Messiah, and generosity in sharing with them and all men, 
2Cor
9:14  and by their prayer for you, who
long for you because of the exceeding favour of Elohim in you. 
2Cor
9:15  Thanks also to Elohim for His
unspeakable gift! 
2Cor
10:1  And I, Sha’ul, myself appeal to
you, through the meekness and gentleness of Messiah – I who am indeed lowly
when face to face with you, but bold toward you when absent! 
2Cor
10:2  But I pray, that when I am present,
I might not be bold with that bravery by which I think to be bold against some
who reckon us as if we walked according to the flesh. 
2Cor
10:3  For though we walk in the flesh, we
do not fight according to the flesh. 
2Cor
10:4  For the weapons we fight with are
not fleshly but mighty in Elohim for overthrowing strongholds, 
2Cor
10:5  overthrowing reasonings and every
high matter that exalts itself against the knowledge of Elohim, taking captive
every thought to make it obedient to the Messiah, 
2Cor
10:6  and being ready to punish all
disobedience, when your obedience is complete.
2Cor
10:7  Take a look at what you are facing.
If anyone seems to trust in himself that he is of Messiah, let him reckon again
for himself, that as he is of Messiah, so also are we. 
2Cor
10:8  For even if I should boast somewhat
more about our authority, which the Master gave us for building up, and not for
overthrowing you, I shall not be put to shame, 
2Cor
10:9  lest I seem to frighten you away by
letters. 
2Cor
10:10  Because they say, “His letters are
truly weighty and strong, but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech
amounts to naught.” 
2Cor
10:11  Let such a one take this into
account, that what we are in word by letters when absent, such we are also in deed when we are present.

2Cor
10:12  For we do not presume to count
ourselves or compare ourselves with those who commend themselves. But they,
measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves,
are not wise. 
2Cor
10:13  But we shall not boast beyond
measure, but within the measure of the limits Elohim assigned unto us, to reach
even to you. 
2Cor
10:14  For we are not overextending
ourselves, as if we did not reach to you, for we also came to you with the Good
News of the Messiah, 
2Cor
10:15  not boasting beyond measure in the
labours of others, but having an expectation, that as your belief grows, we
shall be greatly enlarged by you, according to our limits, 
2Cor
10:16  to bring the Good News in the
parts beyond you – not to boast in another’s limits in what has been
accomplished. 
2Cor
10:17  But “He who boasts, let him boast
in יהוה.”
2Cor
10:18  For not he who commends himself is
approved, but he whom the Master commends. 
2Cor
11:1  I wish that you would bear with me
in a little folly. But indeed, you are bearing with me. 
2Cor
11:2  For I am jealous for you with a
jealousy according to Elohim. For I gave you in marriage to one husband, to
present you as an innocent maiden to Messiah. 
2Cor
11:3  But I am afraid, lest, as the
serpent deceived Ḥawwah by his trickery, so your minds should be
corrupted from the simplicity that is in Messiah. 
2Cor
11:4  For, indeed, if he who is coming
proclaims another יהושע, whom we have not
proclaimed, or if you receive a different spirit which you have not received,
or a different Good News which you have not accepted, you put up with it well
enough!
2Cor
11:5  For I reckon that I am not inferior
to the most eminent emissaries. 
2Cor
11:6  But even if I am unskilled in word,
yet not in knowledge. Indeed, in every way we have been manifested among you in
all matters.
2Cor
11:7  Or did I commit sin in humbling
myself in order to exalt you, because I brought good news, the Good News of
Elohim to you without being paid? 
2Cor
11:8  Other assemblies I robbed, by
receiving wages from them to serve
you. 
2Cor
11:9  And when I was present with you,
and in need, I was not a burden to anyone, for what was lacking to me the
brothers who came from Makedonia supplied. And in every way I kept myself – and
shall keep – from being a burden to you. 
2Cor
11:10  It is a truth of Messiah in me,
that this boasting in me shall not be stopped in the districts of Achaia. 
2Cor
11:11  Why? Is it that I do not love you?
Elohim knows! 
2Cor
11:12  And I shall go on doing as I do,
in order to cut off the occasion from those desiring an occasion, so that in
that which they boast, they might be found also as we are. 
2Cor
11:13  For such are false emissaries, deceptive
workers, masquerading as emissaries of Messiah. 
2Cor
11:14  And no wonder! For Satan himself
masquerades as a messenger of light! 
2Cor
11:15  It is not surprising, then, if his
servants also masquerade as servants of righteousness, whose end shall be
according to their works!
2Cor
11:16  Again I say, let no one think me
to be a fool. And if otherwise, at least receive me as a fool, for me to also
boast a little. 
2Cor
11:17  What I speak, I speak not
according to the Master, but as in foolishness, in this boldness of boasting. 
2Cor
11:18  Since many boast according to the
flesh, I too shall boast. 
2Cor
11:19  For you, being wise, put up with
fools gladly! 
2Cor
11:20  For you put up with it if anyone
enslaves you, if anyone devours you, if anyone takes from you, if anyone exalts
himself, if one hits you in the face. 
2Cor
11:21  To my shame, I say that we were too weak for that! But in whatever
anyone is bold – I say it in foolishness – I am bold also. 
2Cor
11:22  Are they Heḇrews? So am I.
Are they Yisra’ĕlites? So am I. Are they the seed of Aḇraham? So am
I. 
2Cor
11:23  Are they servants of Messiah? – I
speak as beside myself – I am more, in labours much more, in stripes above
measure, in prisons more frequently, in deaths many times. 
2Cor
11:24  Five times I received from the
Yehuḏim forty stripes less one. 
2Cor
11:25  Three times I was beaten with
rods, once I was stoned, three times I was shipwrecked, a night and a day I
have been in the deep, 
2Cor
11:26  in many travels, in dangers of waters,
in dangers of robbers, in dangers from my own race, in dangers from the
gentiles, in dangers in the city, in dangers in the desert, in dangers in the
sea, in dangers among false brothers; 
2Cor
11:27  in toil and hardship, in watchings
often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness, 
2Cor
11:28  besides the matters from outside, what comes upon me daily: the anxiety for all
the assemblies. 
2Cor
11:29  Who is weak, and I am not weak?
Who is made to stumble, and I do not burn inwardly?

2Cor
11:30  If I have to boast, I shall boast
of matters that show up my weakness. 
2Cor
11:31  The Elohim and Father of our
Master יהושע Messiah, who is blessed forever,
knows that I am not lying. 
2Cor
11:32  In Damascus the governor, under
Aretas the sovereign, was guarding the city of the Damascenes, wishing to seize
me, 
2Cor
11:33  but through a window I was let
down in a basket by the wall, and escaped from his hands. 
2Cor
12:1  To boast, indeed, is useless for
me, for I shall go on to visions and revelations of יהוה.

2Cor
12:2  I know a man in Messiah who
fourteen years ago – whether in the body I do not know, or whether out of the
body I do not know, Elohim knows – such a one was caught up to the third heaven.

2Cor
12:3  And I know such a man – whether in
the body or out of the body I do not know, Elohim knows – 
2Cor
12:4  that he was caught up into Paradise
and heard unspeakable words, which it is not right for a man to speak. 
2Cor
12:5  Of such a one I shall boast, but of
myself I shall not boast, except in my weaknesses. 
2Cor
12:6  For if I shall wish to boast, I
shall not be a fool, for I shall speak the truth. But I refrain, lest anyone
should think more of me than what he sees in me, or hears of me. 
2Cor
12:7  And to keep me from exalting myself
because of the exceeding greatness of the revelations, a thorn in the flesh was
given to me, a messenger of Satan to hit me, to keep me from exalting myself. 
2Cor
12:8  Concerning this I pleaded with the
Master three times to take it away from me. 
2Cor
12:9  And He said to me, “My favour is
sufficient for you, for My power is perfected in weakness.” Most gladly, then,
I shall rather boast in my weaknesses, so that the power of Messiah rests on
me. 
2Cor
12:10  Therefore I take pleasure in
weaknesses, in insults, in needs, in persecutions, in distresses, for the sake
of Messiah. For when I am weak, then I am strong. 
2Cor
12:11  I have become a fool – you have
compelled me. For I should have been commended by you, for in no respect was I
behind the most eminent emissaries, though I am a nobody. 
2Cor
12:12  Indeed, the signs of an emissary
were wrought among you with all endurance, in signs and wonders and powers. 
2Cor
12:13  For what is there in which you were
inferior to other assemblies, except that I myself was not a burden to you?
Forgive me this wrong! 
2Cor
12:14  See, I am ready to come to you for
the third time. And I shall not be a burden to you, for I do not seek yours,
but you. For the children should not lay up for the parents, but the parents
for the children. 
2Cor
12:15  And I shall most gladly spend and
be spent for your lives. If I love you more and more, am I to be loved less? 
2Cor
12:16  But be it so, I did not burden
you. But being crafty, did I catch you with guile? 
2Cor
12:17  Did I take advantage of you by any
of those whom I sent to you? 
2Cor
12:18  I urged Titus, and sent our
brother with him. Did Titus take advantage of you? Did we not walk in the same
spirit – not in the same steps? 
2Cor
12:19  Again, do you think that we defend
ourselves to you? We speak before Elohim in Messiah. But all this, beloved, is
for your upbuilding. 
2Cor
12:20  For I fear lest, when I come, I do
not find you such as I wish, and I be found by you such as you do not wish –
lest there be strife, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions,
slander, gossip, puffings up, unrests, 
2Cor
12:21  and lest, when I come again, my
Elohim should humble me among you, and I shall mourn for many who have sinned before
and have not repented of the uncleanness, and whoring, and indecency which they
have practised. 
2Cor
13:1  This is the third time I am coming
to you. “By the mouth of two or three witnesses every word shall be
established.”
2Cor
13:2  I have previously said, and I say
beforehand, as being present the second time, and now being absent I write to
those who have sinned before, and to all the rest, that if I come again I shall
not spare, 
2Cor
13:3  since you are seeking for proof of
Messiah speaking in me, who is not weak toward you, but mighty in you. 
2Cor
13:4  For though He was impaled in
weakness, yet He lives by the power of Elohim. For we also are weak in Him, but
we shall live with Him by the power of Elohim toward you. 
2Cor
13:5  Examine yourselves whether you are
in the belief – prove yourselves. Or do you not know yourselves, that יהושע
Messiah is in you, unless you are disapproved.
2Cor
13:6  And I trust that you shall know
that we are not disapproved. 
2Cor
13:7  And we pray to Elohim that you do
no evil at all – not that we should appear approved, but that you should do
what is right, even though we should appear unapproved. 
2Cor
13:8  For we have no power at all against
the truth, but for the truth. 
2Cor
13:9  For we rejoice when we are weak and
you are strong. And this also we pray for: your perfection.
2Cor
13:10  For this reason I write this in my
absence, so that, being present I should not use sharpness, according to the
authority which the Master has given me for upbuilding and not for
overthrowing. 
2Cor
13:11  For the rest, brothers, rejoice.
Be made perfect, be encouraged, be of one mind, live in peace. And the Elohim
of love and peace shall be with you.
2Cor
13:12  Greet one another with a set-apart
kiss. 
2Cor
13:13  All the set-apart ones greet you. 
2Cor
13:14  The favour of the Master יהושע
Messiah, and the love of Elohim, and the fellowship of the Set-apart Spirit be
with all of you. Amĕn.
