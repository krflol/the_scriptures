Yoḥanan Bĕt/2 John
2John
1:1  The elder, to a chosen Kuria and her
children, whom I love in truth, and not only I, but also all those who have
known the truth, 
2John
1:2  because of the truth which stays in
us and shall be with us forever: 
2John
1:3  Favour, compassion, peace be with
you from Elohim the Father, and from the Master יהושע
Messiah, the Son of the Father, in truth and love. 
2John
1:4  I rejoiced greatly because I found
some of your children walking in truth, as we received a command from the
Father. 
2John
1:5  And now I ask you, Kuria, not as
though I wrote a fresh command to you, but that which we have had from the
beginning: that we love one another. 
2John
1:6  And this is the love, that we walk
according to His commands. This is the command, that as you have heard from the
beginning, you should walk in it.
2John
1:7  Because many who are leading astray
went out into the world who do not confess יהושע
Messiah as coming in the flesh. This one is he who is leading astray and the
anti-messiah. 
2John
1:8  See to yourselves, that we do not
lose what we worked for, but that we might receive a complete reward. 
2John
1:9  Everyone who is transgressing and
not staying in the teaching of Messiah does not possess Elohim. The one who
stays in the teaching of Messiah possesses both the Father and the Son.
2John
1:10  If anyone comes to you and does not
bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house nor greet him, 
2John
1:11  for he who greets him shares in his
wicked works. 
2John
1:12  Having much to write to you, I did
not wish to do so with paper and ink, but I expect to come to you and speak
face to face, so that our joy might be complete. 
2John
1:13  The children of your chosen sister
greet you. Amĕn.
