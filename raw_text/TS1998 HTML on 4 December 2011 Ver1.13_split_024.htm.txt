Iyoḇ/Job
Job
1:1  There was a man in the land of Uts,
whose name was Iyoḇ. And that man was perfect and straight, and one who feared
Elohim and turned aside from evil. 
Job
1:2  And seven sons and three daughters
were born to him. 
Job
1:3  And his possessions were seven
thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and
five hundred female donkeys, and a very large body of servants, so that this
man was the greatest of all the people of the East. 
Job
1:4  And his sons went and had a feast in
the house of each on his day, and sent and invited their three sisters to eat
and to drink with them. 
Job
1:5  And it came to be, when the days of
feasting had gone round, that Iyoḇ would send and set them apart, and he
would rise early in the morning and offer burnt offerings – the number of them
all – for Iyoḇ said, “It might be that my sons have sinned and cursed
Elohim in their hearts.” This Iyoḇ always did. 
Job
1:6  And the day came to be that the sons
of Elohim came to present themselves before יהוה, and
Satan also came among them. 
Job
1:7  And יהוה
said to Satan, “From where do you come?” And Satan answered יהוה
and said, “From diligently searching in the earth, and from walking up and down
in it.”
Job
1:8  And יהוה
said to Satan, “Have you considered My servant Iyoḇ, that there is none
like him on the earth, a perfect and straight man, one who fears Elohim and
turns aside from evil?” 
Job
1:9  And Satan answered יהוה
and said, “Is Iyoḇ fearing Elohim for naught? 
Job
1:10  “Have You not made a hedge around
him, and around his household, and around all that he has on every side? You
have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the
land. 
Job
1:11  But stretch out Your hand, please,
and strike all that he has – if he would not curse You to Your face!” 
Job
1:12  And יהוה
said to Satan, “See, all that he has is in your hand. Only do not lay a hand on
himself.” And Satan went out from the presence of יהוה.

Job
1:13  And the day came to be when his
sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their brother,
the first-born. 
Job
1:14  And a messenger came to Iyoḇ
and said, “The oxen were ploughing and the donkeys feeding alongside them, 
Job
1:15  when Sheḇa fell upon them and
took them away, and they smote the servants with the edge of the sword. And I
alone have escaped to inform you!” 
Job
1:16  While he was still speaking,
another also came and said, “The fire of Elohim fell from the heavens and
burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them. And I alone have
escaped to inform you!” 
Job
1:17  While he was still speaking,
another also came and said, “The Chaldeans formed three bands, and made a raid
on the camels and took them away, and they smote the servants with the edge of
the sword. And I alone have escaped to inform you!”
Job
1:18  While he was still speaking,
another also came and said, “Your sons and daughters were eating and drinking
wine in the house of their brother, the first-born, 
Job
1:19  and see, a great wind came from the
wilderness and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young
men, and they are dead. And I alone have escaped to inform you!” 
Job
1:20  Then Iyoḇ rose up and tore
his robe, and shaved his head, and he fell to the ground and did obeisance. 
Job
1:21  And he said, “Naked I came from my
mother’s womb, and naked I return there. יהוה has
given, and יהוה has taken away. Blessed be the Name of יהוה.”

Job
1:22  In all this Iyoḇ did not sin
nor ascribe wrong-doing unto Elohim. 
Job
2:1  Again the day came to be that the
sons of Elohim came to present themselves before יהוה,
and Satan also came among them to present himself before יהוה.

Job
2:2  And יהוה
said to Satan, “From where do you come?” And Satan answered יהוה
and said, “From diligently searching in the earth, and from walking up and down
in it.” 
Job
2:3  And יהוה
said to Satan, “Have you considered My servant Iyoḇ, that there is none
like him on the earth, a perfect and straight man, one who fears Elohim and
turns aside from evil? And still he holds fast to his integrity, although you
incited Me against him, to destroy him without cause.” 
Job
2:4  And Satan answered יהוה
and said, “Skin for skin, and all that a man has he would give for his life! 
Job
2:5  “But stretch out Your hand, please,
and strike his bone and his flesh – if he would not curse You to Your face!” 
Job
2:6  And יהוה
said to Satan, “See, he is in your hand, only spare his life.” 
Job
2:7  And Satan went out from the presence
of יהוה, and smote Iyoḇ with loathsome sores from
the sole of his foot to the crown of his head. 
Job
2:8  And he took a potsherd with which to
scrape himself while he sat in the midst of the ashes. 
Job
2:9  And his wife said to him, “Do you
still hold fast to your integrity? Curse Elohim and die!” 
Job
2:10  But he said to her, “You speak as
one of the foolish women speaks. Indeed, should we accept only good from Elohim, and not accept evil?” In all this Iyoḇ
did not sin with his lips. 
Job
2:11  And three of the friends of Iyoḇ
heard of all this evil that came on him, and each one came from his own place –
Eliphaz the Tĕmanite, and Bildaḏ the Shuḥite, and Tsophar the
Na‛amathite – and they met together to come to sympathise with him and to
comfort him. 
Job
2:12  And they lifted up their eyes from
a distance, and did not recognise him, and they lifted their voices and wept.
And each one tore his robe and sprinkled dust on his head toward the heavens. 
Job
2:13  Then they sat down with him on the
ground seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word to him, for they
saw that the pain was very great. 
Job
3:1  After this Iyoḇ opened his
mouth and cursed the day of his birth. 
Job
3:2  And Iyoḇ spoke, and said, 
Job
3:3  “Let the day perish on which I was
born, and the night it was said, ‘A male child has been conceived.’ 
Job
3:4  Let that day be darkness. Let not
Eloah from above seek for it, nor let light shine upon it. 
Job
3:5  Let darkness and the shadow of death
buy it back, let a cloud dwell on it, let all that blackens the day frighten
it. 
Job
3:6  That night – let darkness seize it.
Let it not be included among the days of the year, let it not come into the
number of the months. 
Job
3:7  Look, let that night be silent! Let
no singing come into it! 
Job
3:8  Let those curse it who curse the
day, who are ready to stir up Liwiathan. 
Job
3:9  Let the stars of its twilight be
dark. Let it wait for light, but have none. And let it not see the eyelashes of
the dawn. 
Job
3:10  For it did not shut up the doors of
my mother’s womb, nor hide trouble
from my eyes. 
Job
3:11  Why did I not die from the womb,
come forth from the belly and expire? 
Job
3:12  Why were there knees to receive me?
Or breasts for me to suck? 
Job
3:13  For now I would have been lying in
peace. I would have slept – then I would have been at rest, 
Job
3:14  with sovereigns and counsellors of
the earth, who built ruins for themselves, 
Job
3:15  or with rulers who had gold, who
filled their houses with silver, 
Job
3:16  or as a hidden untimely birth, as
infants who never saw light? 
Job
3:17  There the wrong cease raging, and
there the weary are at rest, 
Job
3:18  the prisoners rest together, they
do not hear the voice of the oppressor. 
Job
3:19  The small and great are there, and
the servant is free from his master. 
Job
3:20  Why does He give light to the
sufferer, and life to the bitter of being, 
Job
3:21  who are waiting for death, but it
does not come, and search for it more than treasures; 
Job
3:22  who rejoice exceedingly, they are
glad when they find the grave? 
Job
3:23  Why does He give light to a man
whose way has been hidden, and whom Eloah has hedged in? 
Job
3:24  For my sighing comes before I eat,
and my groanings pour out like water. 
Job
3:25  For that which I greatly feared has
come upon me, and that which I dreaded has overtaken me. 
Job
3:26  I have not been at ease, nor have I
been undisturbed, nor been at rest, yet trouble comes!” 
Job
4:1  And Eliphaz the Tĕmanite
answered and said, 
Job
4:2  “If one tries a word with you, would
you become impatient? But who is able to withhold himself from speaking? 
Job
4:3  See, you have instructed many, and
you have made weak hands strong. 
Job
4:4  Your words have raised up him who
was stumbling, and you have strengthened the weak knees. 
Job
4:5  But now it has come to you, and you
are impatient; it strikes you, and you are troubled. 
Job
4:6  Is not your reverence your trust,
the integrity of ways your expectancy? 
Job
4:7  Remember, please: Who, being
innocent, has ever perished? And where have the straight ones ever been cut
off? 
Job
4:8  According to what I have seen, those
who plough wickedness and sow suffering reap the same. 
Job
4:9  Through the breath of Eloah they
perish, and through the Spirit of His nostrils they are consumed. 
Job
4:10  The roaring of the lion, and the
voice of the fierce lion, but the teeth of the young lions shall be broken. 
Job
4:11  An old lion perishes for lack of
prey, and the cubs of the lioness are scattered. 
Job
4:12  And unto me a word was secretly
brought, and my ear received a little of it. 
Job
4:13  Amid thoughts from visions of the
night, when deep sleep falls on men, 
Job
4:14  fear came upon me, and trembling,
causing my bones to shake greatly. 
Job
4:15  Then a spirit passed before my
face, the hair on my body stood up. 
Job
4:16  It stood still, but I could not
discern its appearance. A form was before my eyes – silence, then a voice I
heard, 
Job
4:17  ‘Is mortal man more righteous than
Eloah? Is man more clean than his Maker? 
Job
4:18  ‘Look, He puts no trust in His
servants, and He charges His messengers with straying. 
Job
4:19  ‘How much more those who dwell in
houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, who are crushed like a moth? 
Job
4:20  ‘From morning till evening they are
beaten down, they perish forever, with no one regarding. 
Job
4:21  ‘Are not the cords of their tents
pulled up? They die, without wisdom!’ 
Job
5:1  “Call out, please, is there anyone
to answer you? And to which of the set-apart ones would you turn? 
Job
5:2  For wrath kills the fool, and envy
slays the simple. 
Job
5:3  I myself have seen the fool taking
root, but suddenly his home was cursed. 
Job
5:4  His sons are far from safety, they
are crushed in the gate, with no one to deliver. 
Job
5:5  The hungry eat up his harvest,
taking it even from the thorns, and the snare snaps up their wealth. 
Job
5:6  For evil does not come from the
dust, nor does trouble spring from the ground; 
Job
5:7  for man is born for trouble, and the
sparks fly upward. 
Job
5:8  But as for me, I would seek Ĕl,
and I would submit my case to Elohim, 
Job
5:9  who is doing great and unsearchable
deeds, innumerable wonders, 
Job
5:10  who is giving rain on the earth’s
face, and is sending waters on the field’s face; 
Job
5:11  to set the lowly on high, and those
who mourn shall be lifted to safety, 
Job
5:12  thwarting the schemes of the
crafty, so that their hands do not work effectively; 
Job
5:13  catching the wise in their own
craftiness, and the counsel of schemers are swept away. 
Job
5:14  By day they encounter darkness, and
at noon they grope as in the night. 
Job
5:15  But He saves the needy from the
sword of their mouth, from the clutches of the strong. 
Job
5:16  Thus the poor have expectancy, and
unrighteousness shuts her mouth. 
Job
5:17  Look, blessed is the man whom Eloah
does reprove, so do not despise the discipline of the Almighty.
Job
5:18  For He bruises, but He binds up; He
smites, but His hands heal.
Job
5:19  In six distresses He delivers you,
and in seven no evil strikes you. 
Job
5:20  In scarcity of food He shall redeem
you from death, and in battle from the power of the sword. 
Job
5:21  When the tongue scourges you are
shielded, and you have no fear when destruction comes. 
Job
5:22  At destruction and at starvation
you laugh, and you have no fear of the beasts of the earth. 
Job
5:23  For your covenant is with the
stones of the field, and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with you. 
Job
5:24  And you shall know that your tent
is in peace, and shall visit your tent and not sin, 
Job
5:25  and shall know that your seed are
many, and your offspring like the grass of the earth. 
Job
5:26  You shall come to the grave in ripe
old age, like the stacking of grain in its season. 
Job
5:27  Look, this we have searched out, it
is so. Hear it, and know for yourself.” 
Job
6:1  And Iyoḇ answered and said,
Job
6:2  “Oh, that my grief were thoroughly
weighed, and my calamity be placed on the scales! 
Job
6:3  For it would outweigh the sand of
the sea, therefore my words have been rash. 
Job
6:4  For the arrows of the Almighty are
within me, my spirit drinks in their poison, the onslaughts of Eloah are
arrayed against me. 
Job
6:5  Does the wild donkey bray when it
has grass, or does the ox bellow over its fodder? 
Job
6:6  Is tasteless food eaten without
salt? Is there any flavour in the juice of mallows? 
Job
6:7  I refuse to touch it, they are like
food when I am sick. 
Job
6:8  Oh that I might have my desire, that
Eloah would grant me what I long for! 
Job
6:9  That it would please Eloah to crush
me, loose His hand and cut me off! 
Job
6:10  Then I would still have comfort,
and I would rejoice in pain, though not spared, for I have not hidden the words
of the Set-apart One. 
Job
6:11  What strength do I have, that I
should wait? And what is my end, that I should prolong my life? 
Job
6:12  Is my strength the strength of stones?
Is my flesh of bronze? 
Job
6:13  Is my help not within me? And is
ability driven from me? 
Job
6:14  To a despiser of friends: shame!
For he is forsaking the fear of the Almighty. 
Job
6:15  My brothers are as undependable as
a wadi, as a bed on which streams once ran, 
Job
6:16  which are dark because of the ice,
in which the snow is hidden. 
Job
6:17  When it is warm, they cease to
flow; when it is hot, they vanish from their place. 
Job
6:18  The paths of their way turn aside,
they enter wastes and perish. 
Job
6:19  Passengers of Tĕma looked
expectantly, travellers of Sheḇa waited for them. 
Job
6:20  They were ashamed because they had
trusted, they came there and were disappointed. 
Job
6:21  Indeed, you have now become the
same! You see my downfall and are
afraid. 
Job
6:22  Did I ever say, ‘Give to me’? or, ‘Offer
a bribe for me from your wealth’? 
Job
6:23  or, ‘Rescue me from the hand of the
enemy?’ or, ‘Redeem me from the hand of oppressors’? 
Job
6:24  Teach me, and I shall be silent.
And show me where I have gone astray. 
Job
6:25  Words of uprightness are harsh! But
what does your reproving reprove? 
Job
6:26  Do you reckon to reprove my words,
and the sayings of one in despair, which are as wind? 
Job
6:27  You would cast lots over the fatherless,
and make merchandise of your friend! 
Job
6:28  But now, please look at me –
whether I would lie to your face. 
Job
6:29  Relent, please, let there be no
unrighteousness. Relent! My righteousness is still in it. 
Job
6:30  Is there unrighteousness on my
tongue? Does my taste not discern what is perverse? 
Job
7:1  “Does not man have to struggle on
earth? For his days are like the days of a hired man. 
Job
7:2  Like a servant who sighs for the
shade, and like a hireling longing for his wages, 
Job
7:3  so am I allotted months of futility.
And nights of trouble have been appointed to me. 
Job
7:4  When I lie down, I say, ‘When am I
going to rise, and the night be ended?’ For I have had my fill of tossing till
dawn. 
Job
7:5  My body is covered with worms and
dirt, my skin is cracked and it festers. 
Job
7:6  My days are swifter than a weaver’s
shuttle, and are spent without expectancy. 
Job
7:7  Remember that my life is a breath!
My eye is never again to see good. 
Job
7:8  The eye of him who sees me sees me
no longer. Your eyes are upon me, and I am no more. 
Job
7:9  The cloud fades and vanishes away,
so he who goes down to the grave does not come up. 
Job
7:10  He returns no more to his house,
nor does his place know him any more. 
Job
7:11  I also, I do not hold my mouth, I
speak in the distress of my spirit, I complain in the bitterness of my being. 
Job
7:12  Am I the sea, or a sea monster,
that You set a guard over me? 
Job
7:13  When I say, ‘My bed does comfort
me, my couch does ease my complaint,’ 
Job
7:14  then You frighten me with dreams
and make me afraid with visions, 
Job
7:15  so that my being chooses
strangling, death rather than my bones. 
Job
7:16  I have wasted away, I would not
live forever. Leave me alone, for my days are a breath. 
Job
7:17  What is man, that You should make
him great, that You should set Your heart on him, 
Job
7:18  that You should visit him every
morning, trying him every moment? 
Job
7:19  How long do You not look away from
me, nor leave me alone till I swallow my saliva? 
Job
7:20  Have I sinned? What have I done to
You, O Watcher of men? Why have You set me as Your target, so that I am a
burden to You? 
Job
7:21  And why do You not pardon my
transgression, and take away my crookedness? For now I lie down in the dust,
and You shall seek me, but I am not.” 
Job
8:1  And Bildaḏ the Shuḥite
answered and said, 
Job
8:2  “How long are you going to speak
like this, since the words of your mouth are a strong wind? 
Job
8:3  Does Ĕl twist right-ruling? Or
does the Almighty twist what is right? 
Job
8:4  If your sons have sinned against
Him, and He delivers them into the hand of their transgression, 
Job
8:5  if you diligently seek Ĕl and
plead with the Almighty, 
Job
8:6  if you were clear and straight, then
indeed He would awake for you, and shall bless your righteous dwelling place. 
Job
8:7  Though your beginning was small, yet
your latter end would greatly increase. 
Job
8:8  Indeed, please ask the former
generation, and prepare for the research of their fathers, 
Job
8:9  for we are but of yesterday, and
know not, because our days on earth are as a shadow. 
Job
8:10  Do they not teach you, speak to
you, and bring forth words from their heart? 
Job
8:11  Does papyrus grow without a marsh,
a reed thrive without water? 
Job
8:12  While it is yet green, not cut
down, it dries out before any plant. 
Job
8:13  So are the paths of all who forget Ĕl,
and the expectancy of a defiled one does perish, 
Job
8:14  whose refuge is cut off, and whose
trust is a spider’s web. 
Job
8:15  He leans on his house, but it does
not stand. He holds it fast, but it does not last. 
Job
8:16  He is moist before the sun, and his
branches spread out in his garden. 
Job
8:17  His roots wrap around a heap, and
look for a place in the stones. 
Job
8:18  If he is destroyed from his place,
then it shall deny him: ‘I have not seen you.’ 
Job
8:19  See, this is the joy of His way,
and out of the dust others grow. 
Job
8:20  See, Ĕl does not cast away the
perfect, neither hold the hand of evil-doers. 
Job
8:21  While He fills your mouth with
laughter, and your lips with rejoicing, 
Job
8:22  those hating you put on shame, and
the tent of the wrong is no more.” 
Job
9:1  And Iyoḇ answered and said,
Job
9:2  “Truly I know it is so. But how is
man right with Elohim? 
Job
9:3  If one wished to dispute with Him,
he would not answer Him one time out of a thousand. 
Job
9:4  Wise in heart and mighty in strength
– who has hardened himself against Him and is at peace? 
Job
9:5  He who removes mountains, and they
do not know it, when He overturns them in His displeasure; 
Job
9:6  who shakes the earth out of its
place, and its columns tremble; 
Job
9:7  who commands the sun, and it does
not rise; and He seals up the stars, 
Job
9:8  stretching out the heavens by
Himself, and treading upon the waves of the sea; 
Job
9:9  who made Ash, Kesil, and Kimah, and
the rooms of the south; 
Job
9:10  who performs great and unsearchable
deeds, and innumerable wonders. 
Job
9:11  Look, He goes by me, and I do not
see; and He moves past, but I do not discern Him. 
Job
9:12  Look, He snatches away, who brings
it back? Who says to Him, ‘What are You doing?’ 
Job
9:13  Eloah does not turn back His
dis-pleasure, the helpers of pride stoop under Him. 
Job
9:14  How much less would I answer Him,
choose my words with Him? 
Job
9:15  For though I were righteous, I
would not answer Him. I pray to Him for my right-ruling. 
Job
9:16  Though I had called and He answered
me, I would not believe that He was listening to my voice. 
Job
9:17  For He crushes me with a storm, and
has multiplied my wounds for no cause. 
Job
9:18  He does not allow me to recover my
breath, but fills me with bitterness. 
Job
9:19  If I speak of power? Look, He is mighty. And if of right-ruling? Who
sets me a time? 
Job
9:20  If I am righteous? My mouth would
declare me wrong. Am I perfect? It would declare me perverse. 
Job
9:21  Am I perfect? Do I not know my own
being? I despise my life! 
Job
9:22  It is all the same, therefore I
say, ‘He destroys the perfect and the wrong.’ 
Job
9:23  If the scourge slays suddenly, He
laughs at the trial of the innocent. 
Job
9:24  Earth has been given into the hand
of the wrong. He covers the faces of its judges. If it is not He, then who is
it? 
Job
9:25  My days have become swifter than a
runner – they have fled, they have not seen good. 
Job
9:26  They have passed by like swift
ships, like an eagle swooping on its prey. 
Job
9:27  If I say, ‘Let me forget my
complaint, let me put off my sad face, and let me smile,’ 
Job
9:28  I shall be afraid of all my
sufferings. I know that You do not hold me innocent. 
Job
9:29  If I am wrong, why should I labour
in vain? 
Job
9:30  If I washed myself with snow water,
and cleansed my hands with soap, 
Job
9:31  then You would plunge me into a
ditch, and my garments shall abhor me. 
Job
9:32  For He is not a man as I am that I answer Him, and we come together
into right-ruling. 
Job
9:33  There is no mediator between us, to
lay his hand upon us both. 
Job
9:34  Let Him take His rod away from me,
and let His dread frighten me. 
Job
9:35  Then
I would speak and not fear Him, for I am not so within myself. 
Job
10:1  “My being has grown weary of life.
I let loose my complaint, I speak in the bitterness of my being. 
Job
10:2  I say to Eloah, ‘Do not declare me
wrong, show me why You strive with me. 
Job
10:3  Is it good to You that You should
crush, that You should despise the work of Your hands, and shine on the counsel
of the wrong? 
Job
10:4  Do You have eyes of flesh? Do You
see as man sees? 
Job
10:5  Are Your days like the days of a
mortal man? Are Your years like the days of a mighty man, 
Job
10:6  that You should seek for my
crookedness and search out my sin? 
Job
10:7  For You know that I am not wrong,
and there is no one to deliver from Your hand. 
Job
10:8  Your hands have made me and shaped
me, together all around, yet You destroy me. 
Job
10:9  Remember, please, that You have
made me like clay. And would You turn me into dust again? 
Job
10:10  Did You not pour me out like milk,
and curdle me like cheese? 
Job
10:11  Skin and flesh you put on me, and
wove me with bones and sinews. 
Job
10:12  Life and kindness You have
bestowed on me, and Your visitation has preserved my spirit. 
Job
10:13  And these You have laid up in Your
heart, I know that this was with You: 
Job
10:14  If I sin, then You watch me, and
let no crookedness of mine go unpunished. 
Job
10:15  If I am wrong, woe to me! And if I
am righteous, I would not lift up my head – filled with shame and seeing my
grief! 
Job
10:16  If I lift it up high, you hunt me
as a lion, and again You would show Yourself marvellous against me. 
Job
10:17  You renew Your witnesses against
me, and increase Your vexation toward me; changes and a host are with me. 
Job
10:18  So why have You brought me forth
from the womb? Oh, that I had perished and no eye had seen me!
Job
10:19  I should have been as though I had
not been – brought from the womb to the grave. 
Job
10:20  Are not my days few? Then cease!
Leave me alone, so that I brighten up a little, 
Job
10:21  Before I go, and not return, to
the land of darkness and the shadow of death, 
Job
10:22  a land as dark as darkness itself,
as the shadow of death, without any order, whose light is as darkness.” 
Job
11:1  And Tsophar the Na‛amathite
answered and said, 
Job
11:2  “Should a multitude of words go
un-answered? And should a man of lips be declared right? 
Job
11:3  Should your babblings silence men?
And should you mock, and no one make you ashamed? 
Job
11:4  Since you have said, ‘My discourse
is flawless, and I have been clean in Your eyes.’ 
Job
11:5  But if only Eloah would speak, and
open His lips against you, 
Job
11:6  and show you the secrets of wisdom,
doubling your ability. Know then that Eloah forgets some of your crookedness for you. 
Job
11:7  Would you find out Eloah by
searching, or search out the end of the Almighty? 
Job
11:8  It is higher than the heavens – what
would you do? Deeper than the grave – what would you know? 
Job
11:9  Their measure is longer than the
earth, and broader than the sea. 
Job
11:10  If He passes through and shuts up,
and gathers, then who does reverse it? 
Job
11:11  For He knows false men. When He
sees wickedness does He not consider it? 
Job
11:12  But a senseless man takes heart
when a wild donkey’s colt is born a man! 
Job
11:13  If you would prepare your heart,
and stretch out your hands toward Him; 
Job
11:14  if wickedness were in your hand,
put it far away and do not let perverseness dwell in your tents; 
Job
11:15  then indeed you shall lift up your
face without spot; and you shall stand firm, and not be afraid, 
Job
11:16  because you would forget sorrow,
and remember it as waters that have passed away, 
Job
11:17  and your life would be brighter
than noon. You would soar upward, you would be like the morning. 
Job
11:18  And you shall trust, because there
is expectancy. And when you have searched you shall lie down in safety. 
Job
11:19  And you shall rest, and no one
would make you afraid, and many shall seek your favour. 
Job
11:20  But the eyes of the wrong are
consumed, and they shall not escape, and their expectancy is the breathing out
of life!” 
Job
12:1  And Iyoḇ answered and said, 
Job
12:2  “Truly you are the people, and
wisdom would die with you! 
Job
12:3  But I, like you, have a heart too;
I am not less than you. And who does not know such as these? 
Job
12:4  I have become a laughing-stock to
my friends – one who has called on Eloah and He answered him! A laughing-stock
is the righteous, the perfect one! 
Job
12:5  A lamp is despised in the thought
of one who is at ease – prepared for those whose feet slip. 
Job
12:6  The tents of robbers are at peace,
and those who provoke Ĕl are complacent, to him who brings Eloah into his
hand! 
Job
12:7  But now ask the beasts, and they
teach you; and the birds of the heavens, and they declare it to you; 
Job
12:8  or speak to the earth, and it
teaches you; and the fish of the sea inform you. 
Job
12:9  Who among all these does not know
that the hand of יהוה has done this, 
Job
12:10  in whose hand is the life of all
that live, and the breath of all mankind? 
Job
12:11  Does the ear not try words? And
the mouth taste food for itself? 
Job
12:12  With the aged is wisdom, and
understanding with length of days. 
Job
12:13  With Him are wisdom and might, He
has counsel and understanding. 
Job
12:14  Look, He breaks down, and it is
not rebuilt. If He imprisons a man, there is no release. 
Job
12:15  Look, He withholds the waters, and
they dry up. And He sends them out, and they overwhelm the earth. 
Job
12:16  With Him are strength and ability.
The misled and the misleader are His. 
Job
12:17  He leads counsellors away
stripped, and makes judges go mad. 
Job
12:18  He loosens the bonds of
sovereigns, and binds a girdle on their loins; 
Job
12:19  who leads away priests as a spoil,
and overthrows the mighty; 
Job
12:20  turning aside the lip of the
trusted ones, and takes away the discernment of the elders; 
Job
12:21  pouring scorn on nobles, and
loosens the girdle of the strong; 
Job
12:22  revealing deep matters out of darkness, and He brings
the shadow of death to light; 
Job
12:23  making nations great, and He
destroys them; spreading out the nations, and He leads them out. 
Job
12:24  turning aside the heart of the
chiefs of the people of the earth, and He makes them wander in a pathless
waste. 
Job
12:25  They grope in darkness, having no
light, and He makes them stagger like a drunkard. 
Job
13:1  “Look, my eye has seen it all, my
ear has heard and understood it. 
Job
13:2  What you know, I know too; I am not
less than you. 
Job
13:3  But I would speak to the Almighty,
and I delight to reason with Ĕl. 
Job
13:4  But you smear with falsehood,
worthless healers, all of you! 
Job
13:5  If you would only be silent, then
it would be your wisdom! 
Job
13:6  Please hear my reasoning, and
listen to the pleadings of my lips. 
Job
13:7  Would you speak perversely for Ĕl,
and speak deceit for Him? 
Job
13:8  Would you be partial towards Him?
Would you plead for Ĕl? 
Job
13:9  Would it be well when He searches
you out? Or could you deceive Him as one deceives a man? 
Job
13:10  He would certainly reprove you if
you secretly show partiality. 
Job
13:11  Should not His excellence make you
afraid, and the dread of Him fall upon you? 
Job
13:12  Your weighty sayings are proverbs
of ashes, your shields are shields of clay. 
Job
13:13  Be silent before me, and let me
speak, and let whatever come upon me! 
Job
13:14  Why do I take my flesh in my
teeth, and put my life in my hands? 
Job
13:15  Though, He does slay me – I wait!
But I show my ways to be right before Him. 
Job
13:16  He also is my deliverance, for a
defiled one does not come before Him. 
Job
13:17  Listen closely to my words, and
with your ears to what I say. 
Job
13:18  Look, please, I have prepared my
case, I know that I am in the right. 
Job
13:19  Who is he who would strive with
me? For then I would keep silent and die. 
Job
13:20  Only two matters do not do to me, then I am not hidden from Your face: 
Job
13:21  Withdraw Your hand far from me,
and let not dread of You make me afraid. 
Job
13:22  Then call, and let me answer; or
let me speak, and You reply to me. 
Job
13:23  How many are my crookednesses and
sins? Let me know my transgression and my sin. 
Job
13:24  Why do You hide Your face, and
reckon me as Your enemy? 
Job
13:25  Would You frighten a leaf driven
to and fro? And would You pursue dry stubble? 
Job
13:26  For You write bitter charges against me, and make me inherit
the crookednesses of my youth, 
Job
13:27  and put my feet in the stocks, and
look closely to all my paths. You set a limit for the soles of my feet. 
Job
13:28  And he, like that which is rotten,
wastes away, as a garment that is moth-eaten. 
Job
14:1  “Man born of woman is of few days
and turmoil-filled. 
Job
14:2  He comes forth like a flower and
withers. He flees like a shadow and does not continue. 
Job
14:3  Yet on such a one You open Your
eyes, and bring me to right-ruling with Yourself! 
Job
14:4  Who brings the clean out of the
unclean? No one! 
Job
14:5  Since his days are decided, the
number of his months is with You, You have appointed his bounds which he does
not pass over. 
Job
14:6  Look away from him and let him
rest, till like a hired man he enjoys his day. 
Job
14:7  For there is expectancy for a tree,
if it is cut down, that it does sprout again, and that its tender branch does
not cease. 
Job
14:8  Though its root grows old in the
earth, and its stump dies in the ground, 
Job
14:9  at the scent of water it buds and
brings forth foliage like a plant. 
Job
14:10  But man dies and is powerless, and
man expires, and where is he? 
Job
14:11  Water disappears from the sea, and
a river dries up and is parched, 
Job
14:12  and man shall lie down and not
rise. Till the heavens are no more, they awake not, nor are aroused from their
sleep. 
Job
14:13  If only You would hide me in the
grave, conceal me until Your wrath turns away. Set me a time, and remember me! 
Job
14:14  If a man dies, would he live
again? All the days of my struggle I wait, till my change comes. 
Job
14:15  You would call, and I would answer
You. You have yearned for the work of Your hands. 
Job
14:16  For now You count my steps – do
You not watch over my sin? 
Job
14:17  My transgression is sealed up in a
bag, and You cover over my crookedness. 
Job
14:18  But a falling mountain crumbles
away, and a rock is moved from its place, 
Job
14:19  as water wears away stones, its
out-pouring washes away the soil of the earth – so You have destroyed the
expectancy of man. 
Job
14:20  You overpower him, forever, and he
is gone – his face changes and You send him away. 
Job
14:21  His sons come to esteem, and he
does not know it. And they are brought low, and he does not perceive it. 
Job
14:22  He feels only the pain of his
flesh, and he mourns over himself.” 
Job
15:1  And Eliphaz the Tĕmanite
answered and said, 
Job
15:2  “Would a wise man answer with vain
knowledge, or fill his belly with the east wind? 
Job
15:3  Would he reason with useless talk,
or by speeches with which do not profit? 
Job
15:4  Indeed, you do away with reverence,
and withhold prayer before Ĕl. 
Job
15:5  For your crookedness teaches your
mouth what to say, and you choose the
tongue of the crafty. 
Job
15:6  Not I, but your own mouth condemns
you. And your own lips witness against you. 
Job
15:7  Were you the first one born? Or
were you made before the hills? 
Job
15:8  Have you heard the secret counsel
of Eloah? And do you limit wisdom to yourself? 
Job
15:9  What do you know that we do not
know – understand, that is not within us? 
Job
15:10  Both the grey-haired and the aged
are among us, much older than your father. 
Job
15:11  Are the comforts of Ĕl not
enough for you – and a word that deals gently with you? 
Job
15:12  What have you taken to heart? And
why do your eyes flash? 
Job
15:13  That you should turn your spirit
against Ĕl, and let such words
go out of your mouth? 
Job
15:14  What is man, that he should be
clean? And one born of a woman, that he should be righteous? 
Job
15:15  Look, He puts no trust in His
set-apart ones, and the heavens are not clean in His eyes, 
Job
15:16  how much less one who is loathsome
and corrupt, drinking unrighteousness like water! 
Job
15:17  Let me show you – hear me – and
this I have seen and declare, 
Job
15:18  which the wise declare, and have
not hidden from their fathers, 
Job
15:19  to them alone the land was given,
and no stranger passed over into their midst: 
Job
15:20  All the days of the wrong one he
is paining himself, and few years have been stored up for the ruthless. 
Job
15:21  A frightening sound is in his
ears; in peace a destroyer comes to him. 
Job
15:22  He believes not to return from darkness,
and he is reserved for the sword. 
Job
15:23  He wanders about for food – where
is it? He knows that a day of darkness is prepared for him. 
Job
15:24  Distress and pain frighten him –
they overwhelm him, like a sovereign ready for the attack. 
Job
15:25  Because he has stretched out his
hand against Ĕl, and acts mightily against the Almighty. 
Job
15:26  He runs against Him defiantly,
with thick-bossed shields. 
Job
15:27  For he has covered his face with
his fatness, and he has put layers of fat on his loins. 
Job
15:28  But he dwells in ruined cities, in
houses which no one lives in, which have been ready to become heaps. 
Job
15:29  He shall not be rich, and his
wealth shall not rise, and his possessions shall not overspread the earth. 
Job
15:30  He does not turn away from
darkness. The flame dries up his branches, and he turns aside by the breath of
His mouth. 
Job
15:31  Let him not trust in falsehood,
deceiving himself, for falsehood is his reward. 
Job
15:32  Before his day it is accomplished,
and his branch shall not be green. 
Job
15:33  He shakes off his unripe grape
like a vine, and throws off his blossom like an olive tree. 
Job
15:34  For the company of the defiled
ones is barren, and fire consumes the tents of bribery. 
Job
15:35  They conceive trouble and bring
forth wickedness, even their womb prepares deception.” 
Job
16:1  And Iyoḇ answered and said, 
Job
16:2  “I have heard many matters like these; all of you are
comforters of trouble! 
Job
16:3  Is there an end to words of wind? Or
what provokes you that you answer? 
Job
16:4  I might also speak like you, if you
were in my place. I might heap up words against you, and shake my head at you. 
Job
16:5  I might strengthen you with my
mouth, and my moving lips might bring relief. 
Job
16:6  If I speak, my pain is not
relieved; and if I refrain, does it leave me? 
Job
16:7  But now He has wearied me. You have
stunned all my company. 
Job
16:8  And You have plucked me, and it is
a witness. And my failure rises up against me, it bears witness to my face. 
Job
16:9  He has torn in His wrath, and He
hates me. He has gnashed at me with His teeth; my adversary sharpens His eyes
upon me. 
Job
16:10  They open wide their mouths at me,
in scorn they have smitten my cheeks, they mass themselves together against me.

Job
16:11  Ĕl has handed me over to the
perverse, and cast me into the hands of the wrong. 
Job
16:12  I was at ease, but He broke me.
And He took me by my neck and shattered me, and He has set me up for His
target. 
Job
16:13  His archers surround me, He splits
my kidneys in two and does not spare, He pours out my bile on the ground. 
Job
16:14  He made a breach in me, breach
upon breach. He runs upon me like a mighty man. 
Job
16:15  I sewed sackcloth over my skin,
and laid my horn in the dust. 
Job
16:16  My face is reddened from weeping,
and on my eyelids is the shadow of death; 
Job
16:17  though no violence was on my hand,
and my prayer sincere. 
Job
16:18  O earth, do not cover my blood,
and let my cry have no resting place! 
Job
16:19  See, even now my witness is in the
heavens, and my defender is on high. 
Job
16:20  My friends are they that scorn me;
my eyes pour out tears to Eloah. 
Job
16:21  O that one might plead for a man
with Eloah, as a man with his neighbour! 
Job
16:22  When a few years are past, then I
shall go the way of no return. 
Job
17:1  “My spirit has been broken, my days
have been extinguished, graves are for me. 
Job
17:2  Truly, mockeries are with me, and
my eye rests on their insults! 
Job
17:3  Please lay down a pledge for me
with Yourself. Who would strike hands with me? 
Job
17:4  For You have hidden their heart
from understanding, therefore You do not exalt them. 
Job
17:5  He who denounces friends for a
share, even the eyes of his children shall fail. 
Job
17:6  But He has made me a byword of the
people, whereas in former times I was as a drum. 
Job
17:7  And from sorrow my eye has grown
dim, and all my members are like shadows. 
Job
17:8  Upright ones are astonished at
this, and the innocent stirs himself up against the defiled one. 
Job
17:9  And the righteous holds to his way,
and he who has clean hands becomes stronger and stronger. 
Job
17:10  But please, come back again, all
of you, for I do not find a wise one among you. 
Job
17:11  My days have passed by, my plans
have been broken off – the desires of my heart. 
Job
17:12  They would turn night into day, saying that light is near, in the
presence of darkness! 
Job
17:13  If I wait – the grave is my house,
I shall make my bed in darkness, 
Job
17:14  I shall say to corruption, ‘You
are my father,’ – to the worm, ‘You are my mother and my sister.’ 
Job
17:15  Where then is my expectancy? As
for my expectancy, who would see it? 
Job
17:16  Would it sink down into the grave?
Would we together go down into the dust?” 
Job
18:1  And Bildaḏ the Shuḥite
answered and said, 
Job
18:2  “When do you put an end to words?
Understand, and let us then talk. 
Job
18:3  Why should we be reckoned as
beasts, as stupid in your eyes? 
Job
18:4  You who tear yourself to pieces in
displeasure – would the earth be forsaken for your sake? Or the rock move from
its place? 
Job
18:5  Indeed, the light of the wrong goes
out, and the flame of his fire does not shine. 
Job
18:6  The light shall be dark in his
tent, and his lamp beside him is put out. 
Job
18:7  The steps of his strength are
impeded, and his own counsel overthrows him. 
Job
18:8  For he is sent into a net by his
own feet, and he walks on a pit-fall. 
Job
18:9  The net seizes his heel, a snare
prevails over him. 
Job
18:10  A noose is hidden on the ground
for him, and a trap for him in the path. 
Job
18:11  Alarms frighten him on all sides,
and chase him at his heels. 
Job
18:12  His strength is starved, and
calamity is ready at his side. 
Job
18:13  It devours parts of his skin, the
first-born of death devours his parts. 
Job
18:14  He is torn from the shelter of his
tent, and they parade him before the sovereign of alarms. 
Job
18:15  In his tent dwells that which is
none of his; brimstone is scattered on his house. 
Job
18:16  His roots below dry up, and his
branch is cut off above. 
Job
18:17  Remembrance of him perishes from
the earth, and he has no name on the street. 
Job
18:18  They thrust him from light into
darkness, and chase him out of the world. 
Job
18:19  He leaves no offspring or
descendant among his people, nor any survivor in his dwellings. 
Job
18:20  Those in the west are astonished
at his day, as those in the east are frightened. 
Job
18:21  Indeed, such are the dwellings of
the perverse, and this is the place of him who does not know Ĕl.” 
Job
19:1  And Iyoḇ answered and said, 
Job
19:2  “How long would you grieve my life,
and crush me with words? 
Job
19:3  These ten times you have insulted
me, shamelessly you attack me. 
Job
19:4  Even if I have truly gone astray,
my straying remains with me. 
Job
19:5  If indeed you would exalt
yourselves above me, and plead against me my reproach, 
Job
19:6  know then that Eloah has overthrown
me, and has surrounded me with His net. 
Job
19:7  See, I cry, ‘Violence!’ but I am
not heard. I cry aloud, but there is no right-ruling. 
Job
19:8  He has fenced up my way, and I pass
not over. And He has placed darkness in my paths. 
Job
19:9  He has stripped me of my esteem,
and taken the crown from my head. 
Job
19:10  He breaks me down on every side,
and I am gone; and uproots my expectancy like a tree. 
Job
19:11  And He kindled His wrath against
me, and He counts me as one of His enemies. 
Job
19:12  His companies come together, and
they cast up their way against me, and encamp all around my tent. 
Job
19:13  He has removed my brothers far
away from me, and my friends are completely estranged from me. 
Job
19:14  My near ones have fallen away, and
my close friends have forgotten me. 
Job
19:15  The guests in my house, and my
female servants, reckon me for a stranger – I am a foreigner in their eyes. 
Job
19:16  I have called my servant, but he
gives no answer – I have to beg him with my mouth. 
Job
19:17  My spirit is strange to my wife,
and my kindness to the children of my own body. 
Job
19:18  Even young children have scorned
me. I rise, and they speak against me. 
Job
19:19  All my intimate friends loathe me,
and those whom I love have turned against me. 
Job
19:20  My bone clings to my skin and to
my flesh, and I have escaped by the skin of my teeth. 
Job
19:21  Show favour to me, show favour to
me, O you my friends, for the hand of Eloah has struck me! 
Job
19:22  Why do you persecute me like Ĕl
does, and are not satisfied with my
flesh? 
Job
19:23  Oh, that my words were written
down! Oh, that they were inscribed in a book, 
Job
19:24  engraved on a rock with an iron
pen and lead, forever! 
Job
19:25  For I know that my Redeemer lives,
and as the Last shall rise over the dust; 
Job
19:26  and after my skin has been struck
off, then in my flesh I shall see Eloah, 
Job
19:27  whom I myself shall see on my
side, and not a stranger. My kidneys have failed within me! 
Job
19:28  If you say, ‘Why do we persecute
him?’ Seeing the root of the matter has been found in me, 
Job
19:29  fear the sword yourselves, for
wrath brings the punishment of the
sword, so that you know there is a judgment.” 
Job
20:1  Then Tsophar the Na‛amathite
answered and said, 
Job
20:2  “Truly, my thoughts make me
respond, even because of my haste within me. 
Job
20:3  I have listened to the reproof
which insults me, and the spirit of my understanding makes me answer. 
Job
20:4  You have known this of old, since
man was placed on earth, 
Job
20:5  that the singing of the wrong is
short-lived, and the joy of the defiled one is but for a moment? 
Job
20:6  Although his pride mounts up to the
heavens, and his head does reach to the clouds, 
Job
20:7  he perishes forever like his own
dung. Those who have seen him say, ‘Where is he?’ 
Job
20:8  He flies away like a dream, and is
not found. And he is driven away like a vision of the night. 
Job
20:9  Eyes that saw him do so no more,
nor does his place see him any more. 
Job
20:10  His sons seek the favour of the
poor, and his hands give back his wealth. 
Job
20:11  His bones shall be filled with his
youth, but it lies down with him in the dust. 
Job
20:12  Though evil is sweet in his mouth,
he hides it under his tongue, 
Job
20:13  though he fondles it and does not forsake it, but still keeps it in
his mouth,
Job
20:14  his food is turned in his stomach,
the bitterness of cobras is in him. 
Job
20:15  He has swallowed down riches, then
vomits them up – Ĕl drives it out of his stomach. 
Job
20:16  He sucks the poison of cobras; the
tongue of the poisonous snake slays him. 
Job
20:17  He looks not on streams, the
rivers flowing with honey and cream. 
Job
20:18  He is giving back what he laboured
for, and does not eat it – like wealth from his trade, but he does not enjoy. 
Job
20:19  For he has oppressed, he has
forsaken the poor, he has seized a house which he did not build. 
Job
20:20  For he shall not know ease in his
innermost, neither save what he desires. 
Job
20:21  There is no left-over after he has
eaten, therefore his good does not last. 
Job
20:22  With all his plenty he is in
distress; the hand of every labourer comes against him. 
Job
20:23  It shall be, at the filling of his
stomach, that He casts on him His burning wrath, and rains it down on him while
he is eating. 
Job
20:24  He shall flee from the iron
weapon, a bronze bow pierce him through. 
Job
20:25  It is drawn, and comes out of the
body, and the gleaming point comes out of his gall. Fears come upon him. 
Job
20:26  All darkness waits for his
treasures. A fire not blown consumes him, it destroys what remains in his tent.

Job
20:27  The heavens reveal his
crookedness, and the earth rises up against him. 
Job
20:28  The increase of his house departs,
flowing away in the day of His wrath. 
Job
20:29  This is the portion from Elohim
for a wrong man, and the heritage Ĕl has decreed for him.” 
Job
21:1  And Iyoḇ answered and said, 
Job
21:2  “Listen closely to my word, and let
this be your comfort. 
Job
21:3  Bear with me and let me speak, and
after I have spoken, keep mocking. 
Job
21:4  As for me, is my complaint against
man? And why should I not be impatient? 
Job
21:5  Look at me and be appalled, then
put your hand on your mouth. 
Job
21:6  And when I consider it I am
frightened, and my body shudders. 
Job
21:7  Why do the wrong live, become old,
and become mighty in power?
Job
21:8  Their seed is established with them
before their face, and their offspring before their eyes. 
Job
21:9  Their houses are peace without
fear, neither is the rod of Eloah upon them. 
Job
21:10  Their bull breeds and does not
fail, their cow calves without miscarriage. 
Job
21:11  They send forth their little ones
like a flock, and their children dance. 
Job
21:12  They sing to the tambourine and
lyre, and rejoice to the sound of the flute. 
Job
21:13  They spend their days in goodness,
and in a moment go down to the grave. 
Job
21:14  And they say to Ĕl, ‘Turn
aside from us, for we have no desire to know Your ways. 
Job
21:15  Who is the Almighty, that we
should serve Him? And what profit do we have if we pray to Him?’ 
Job
21:16  See, is their good not in their
own hand? (The counsel of the wrong has been far from me). 
Job
21:17  How often is the lamp of the wrong
put out, and does come upon them their calamity, sorrows He allots in His
displeasure? 
Job
21:18  They are like straw before the
wind, and like chaff that a storm steals away. 
Job
21:19  You say, ‘Eloah stores up one’s wickedness for his children.’ Let
Him repay him, so that he knows it. 
Job
21:20  Let his eyes see his destruction,
and let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty. 
Job
21:21  For what is his delight in his
house after him, when the number of his months is cut off? 
Job
21:22  Does anyone teach Ĕl
knowledge, since He judges those that are exalted? 
Job
21:23  One dies in his perfect strength,
completely at ease and satisfied; 
Job
21:24  His pails are filled with milk,
and his bones are juicy with marrow. 
Job
21:25  Another one dies in the bitterness
of his being, and never eats with pleasure. 
Job
21:26  Together they lie down in the
dust, and worms cover them. 
Job
21:27  Look, I know your thoughts, and
the plots with which you would wrong me. 
Job
21:28  For you say, ‘Where is the house
of the noble one? And where is the tent, the dwelling place of the wrong ones?’

Job
21:29  Have you not asked those passing
by the way? And do you not know their signs? 
Job
21:30  That the wicked is kept for the
day of calamity. They are brought to the day of wrath. 
Job
21:31  Who declares his way to his face?
And who repays him for what he has done? 
Job
21:32  As for him, he is brought to the
grave, and a watch is kept over the tomb. 
Job
21:33  The clods of the wadi shall be
sweet to him, and all men follow him, innumerable are those before him. 
Job
21:34  How then do you comfort me in
vain, seeing that perverseness remains in your answers?” 
Job
22:1  And Eliphaz the Tĕmanite
answered and said, 
Job
22:2  “Would a strong man be of use to Ĕl?
Even he who is wise be of use to Him? 
Job
22:3  Is it a delight to the Almighty
that you are righteous? Or gain, that you make your ways perfect? 
Job
22:4  Is it because of your fear of Him
that He reproves you, or enters into right-ruling with you? 
Job
22:5  Is not your evil great? And is
there no end to your crookednesses? 
Job
22:6  For you take pledges from your
brother for naught, and strip the naked of their garments. 
Job
22:7  You do not give the weary water to
drink, and you have withheld bread from the hungry. 
Job
22:8  But the man of strength, he has the
earth, and the highly respected man dwells in it. 
Job
22:9  You have sent widows away empty,
and the arms of the fatherless are crushed. 
Job
22:10  Therefore snares are all around
you, and sudden fear alarms you, 
Job
22:11  or darkness, so that you do not
see, and a flood of water covers you. 
Job
22:12  Is not Eloah in the height of
heaven? And see the highest stars, how lofty they are! 
Job
22:13  And you have said, ‘What does Ĕl
know? Would He judge through the dark cloud? 
Job
22:14  ‘Clouds screen Him, so that He
does not see, and He moves about the circuit of the heavens.’ 
Job
22:15  Do you observe the old way which
wicked men have trod, 
Job
22:16  who were cut down before their
time, whose foundations were swept away by a flood? 
Job
22:17  They said to Ĕl, ‘Turn aside
from us!’ And what did the Almighty do to them? 
Job
22:18  Yet He filled their houses with
the good! (But the counsel of the wrong has been far from me). 
Job
22:19  The righteous see it and are glad,
and the innocent mock at them and say,

Job
22:20  ‘Truly, our adversaries are cut
off, and fire has consumed their excess.’ 
Job
22:21  Be of service to Him, and be at
peace; thereby blessing shall come to you. 
Job
22:22  Please accept the Torah from His
mouth, and lay up His words in your heart. 
Job
22:23  If you return to the Almighty, you
are built up. If you remove unrighteousness far from your tents, 
Job
22:24  and lay your gold in the dust, and the
gold of Ophir among the stones of the wadis, 
Job
22:25  then the Almighty shall be your
gold and your silver, strength to you. 
Job
22:26  Then you shall certainly delight
in the Almighty, and lift up your face to Eloah, 
Job
22:27  make your prayer to Him. And He
shall hear you, and you shall pay your vows. 
Job
22:28  And whatever you decide on shall
be established for you, and light shine on your ways. 
Job
22:29  For they have made low, and you
say, ‘Up!’ And He saves the lowly of eyes. 
Job
22:30  Would He deliver one who is not
innocent? So by the cleanness of your hands you shall be delivered.” 
Job
23:1  And Iyoḇ answered and said, 
Job
23:2  “Even today my complaint is bitter;
my hand is heavy on account of my groaning. 
Job
23:3  If only I knew where to find Him, I
would come to His dwelling-place!
Job
23:4  I would present my case before Him,
and fill my mouth with proofs. 
Job
23:5  I would know the words which He
would answer me, and understand what He would say to me. 
Job
23:6  Would He contend with me in great
power? No! But He would pay attention to me.
Job
23:7  There the upright might reason with
Him, and I would go safe forever from my Judge. 
Job
23:8  See, I go forward, but He is not;
and backward, but I do not perceive Him; 
Job
23:9  to the left where He is working,
but I do not see; He turns to the right, but I do not see. 
Job
23:10  For He knows the way that I take.
When He has tried me, I would come forth as gold. 
Job
23:11  My foot has held fast to His
steps. I have guarded His way, and did not turn aside. 
Job
23:12  I have not strayed from the
command of His lips. I have treasured the words of His mouth more than my daily portion. 
Job
23:13  But He is One, and who does turn
Him? And He does whatever His being has desired. 
Job
23:14  For He completes my portion, and
many like these are with Him. 
Job
23:15  Therefore I am troubled at His
presence; I consider, and I am afraid of Him. 
Job
23:16  For Ĕl has made me
faint-hearted, and the Almighty has alarmed me; 
Job
23:17  because I was not cut off before
darkness, and from my face He has covered the thick darkness. 
Job
24:1  “Times are not hidden from the
Almighty, and why have not those who know Him seen His days? 
Job
24:2  They remove landmarks; they rob and
feed on flocks; 
Job
24:3  they drive away the donkey of the
fatherless; they take the widow’s ox as a pledge; 
Job
24:4  they turn the needy out of the way;
the poor of the earth have hidden together. 
Job
24:5  See, as wild donkeys in the
wilderness they go about their tasks, eager seekers for prey; the desert gives his bread, for the children. 
Job
24:6  They reap his fodder in a field and
they glean the vineyard of the wrong. 
Job
24:7  They spend the night naked, without
a garment, and without covering in the cold. 
Job
24:8  They are wet with the showers of
the hills, and have embraced a rock for lack of shelter. 
Job
24:9  They snatch away the fatherless
from the breast, and take a pledge from the poor; 
Job
24:10  naked, they shall go about without
a garment; and hungry, they shall take away sheaves. 
Job
24:11  They press out oil within their
walls; winepresses they shall tread, yet suffer thirst. 
Job
24:12  Men groan in the city, and the
beings of the wounded cry out, and Eloah does not regard it as foolish. 
Job
24:13  They have become rebels against
the light; they have not known His ways nor remained in His paths. 
Job
24:14  The murderer rises at daylight, he
slays the poor and needy, and in the night he is as a thief. 
Job
24:15  And the eye of the adulterer
watches for dusk, saying, ‘No eye sees me.’ And he puts a covering on the face.

Job
24:16  In the dark he has broken into
houses; by day they shut themselves up; they have not known light. 
Job
24:17  For all of them morning is the
same as the shadow of death, when he discerns the extreme fears of the shadow
of death. 
Job
24:18  He is swift on the face of the
waters; their portion is cursed in the earth; he does not turn into the way of
vineyards. 
Job
24:19  Drought and heat snatch away snow
waters – the grave those who have
sinned. 
Job
24:20  The womb forgets him, the worm
feeds sweetly on him; he is remembered no more, and wickedness is broken like a
tree; 
Job
24:21  treating evil the barren who does
not bear, and does no good for the widow. 
Job
24:22  But He draws the mighty away with
His power – He rises up, and no one is certain of life. 
Job
24:23  He gives him safety, and he leans
on it; yet His eyes are on their ways. 
Job
24:24  They are lifted up for a little
while, then they are gone, then they shall be brought low. Like all else they are gathered up, and they are
cut off like the heads of grain. 
Job
24:25  And if it is not so, who does
prove me a liar, and make my word worthless?” 
Job
25:1  And Bildaḏ the Shuḥite
answered and said, 
Job
25:2  “Rule and fear belong to Him,
making peace in His high places. 
Job
25:3  Is there any number to His armies?
And on whom does His light not rise? 
Job
25:4  So how could man be righteous
before Ĕl? Or how could he be flawless who is born of a woman? 
Job
25:5  See, even the moon does not shine,
and the stars have not been flawless in His eyes, 
Job
25:6  how much less man, a maggot, and a
son of man, a worm?” 
Job
26:1  And Iyoḇ answered and said, 
Job
26:2  “How have you helped the powerless,
saved an arm not strong? 
Job
26:3  How have you given counsel to the
unwise, or declared sound advice to many? 
Job
26:4  With whom have you spoken words?
And whose spirit came from you? 
Job
26:5  The dead wait – those under the
waters and those inhabiting them. 
Job
26:6  The grave is naked before Him, and
destruction has no covering. 
Job
26:7  He
it was who stretched out the north over emptiness, hanging the earth upon
space, 
Job
26:8  binding up waters in His thick
clouds, and the cloud is not torn under them, 
Job
26:9  covering the surface of His throne,
spreading His cloud over it. 
Job
26:10  He drew a limit on the surface of
the waters, at the boundary of light and darkness. 
Job
26:11  The columns of the heavens
tremble, and are stunned at His reproof. 
Job
26:12  By His power He has calmed the
sea, and by His understanding He struck down Rahaḇ. 
Job
26:13  By His Spirit He adorned the
heavens. His hand whirled the fleeing serpent. 
Job
26:14  See, these are the fringes of His
ways, and how little a matter is heard of Him! And who understands the thunder
of His power?” 
Job
27:1  And Iyoḇ again took up his
discourse, and said, 
Job
27:2  “As Ĕl lives, who has turned
aside my right-ruling, and the Almighty, who has made my life bitter, 
Job
27:3  as long as my breath is in me, and
the spirit of Eloah in my nostrils, 
Job
27:4  my lips do not speak
unrighteousness, nor my tongue utter deceit. 
Job
27:5  Far be it from me that I grant that
you are right. Until I die I would not turn aside my integrity from me. 
Job
27:6  My righteousness I hold fast, and I
do not let it go. My heart does not reproach me as long as I live. 
Job
27:7  Let my enemy be like the wrongdoer,
and he who rises up against me like the unrighteous. 
Job
27:8  For what is the expectancy of the
defiled one, when He does cut off, when Eloah takes away his life? 
Job
27:9  Would Ĕl hear his cry when
distress comes upon him? 
Job
27:10  Would he delight himself in the
Almighty – call on Eloah at all times? 
Job
27:11  Let me teach you by the hand of Ĕl,
that which is with the Almighty I do not hide. 
Job
27:12  See, all of you have seen it. Why
then are you altogether vain? 
Job
27:13  This is the portion of a wrong man
with Ĕl, and the inheritance of cruel ones, which they receive from the
Almighty: 
Job
27:14  If his children are increased, it
is for the sword; and his offspring shall not have enough to eat. 
Job
27:15  Those who remain of him are buried
in death, and their widows do not weep. 
Job
27:16  Though he heaps up silver like
dust, and lays up garments like clay – 
Job
27:17  he lays up, but the righteous puts
it on, and the innocent divides the silver. 
Job
27:18  He built his house like a moth,
like a booth which a watchman made. 
Job
27:19  He lies down, a rich man, but he
is not gathered. When he opens his eyes, it is no more! 
Job
27:20  Alarms overtake him like a flood;
a storm wind shall steal him away in the night. 
Job
27:21  The east wind takes him away, and
he is gone; for it sweeps him from his place. 
Job
27:22  And it hurls itself against him
and does not spare; he swiftly flees from its power. 
Job
27:23  It claps its hands at him, and it
hisses him out of his place. 
Job
28:1  “Indeed, there is a mine for
silver, and a place where gold is refined. 
Job
28:2  Iron is taken from the earth, and
copper is smelted from ore. 
Job
28:3  An end to darkness he has set, and
to every limit he is searching, to rocks in deepest darkness. 
Job
28:4  He opens a shaft far away from
people; they are forgotten by feet; they hang far away from men; they swing to
and fro. 
Job
28:5  Earth, out of which grows food, is
turned underneath as by fire; 
Job
28:6  its stones are the place of
sapphires, and it has dust of gold. 
Job
28:7  No bird of prey knows the path, nor
has the hawk’s eye seen it. 
Job
28:8  The proud beasts have not trodden
it, nor has the fierce lion passed over it. 
Job
28:9  He puts his hand on the flint; he
shall overturn the mountains at the roots. 
Job
28:10  He cuts out channels in the rocks,
and his eye sees every precious gem. 
Job
28:11  He dams up the sources of the
rivers; and he brings to light what is hidden. 
Job
28:12  And wisdom – where is it found?
And where is the place of understanding? 
Job
28:13  Man does not know its value, and
it is not found in the land of the living. 
Job
28:14  The deep has said, ‘It is not in
me,’ and the sea has said, ‘It is not with me.’ 
Job
28:15  Gold is not given for it, nor is
silver weighed out as its price. 
Job
28:16  It is not valued in the gold of
Ophir, in precious shoham or sapphire. 
Job
28:17  Gold or crystal are not to be
compared with it, nor is it exchanged for a vessel of fine gold. 
Job
28:18  No mention is made of coral or
crystal, for the price of wisdom is above rubies. 
Job
28:19  The topaz of Kush is not to be
compared with it, nor is it valued in clean gold. 
Job
28:20  And wisdom – from where does it
come? And where is the place of understanding?
Job
28:21  It has been hidden from the eyes
of all living, and concealed from the birds of the heavens. 
Job
28:22  Destruction and death have said, ‘With
our ears we have heard a report of it.’ 
Job
28:23  Elohim has understood its way, and
He has known its place. 
Job
28:24  For He looks to the ends of the
earth, sees under all the heavens, 
Job
28:25  making a weight for the wind, and
measuring out the waters by measure. 
Job
28:26  When He made a law for the rain,
and a way for the lightning of thunder, 
Job
28:27  then He saw wisdom and declared
it; He prepared it and also searched it out. 
Job
28:28  And He said to man, ‘See, the fear
of יהוה, that is wisdom, and to turn from evil is
understanding.’ ” 
Job
29:1  And Iyoḇ again took up his
discourse, and said, 
Job
29:2  “Oh, that I were as in months past,
as in the days when Eloah protected me; 
Job
29:3  when His lamp shone on my head,
when I walked in the dark by His light; 
Job
29:4  as I was in the days of my autumn,
when the intimacy of Eloah was on my tent; 
Job
29:5  when the Almighty was still with
me, when my children were around me; 
Job
29:6  when my steps were bathed with
cream, and the rock poured out rivers of oil for me. 
Job
29:7  When I went out to the gate by the
city, to take my seat in the open square, 
Job
29:8  the young men saw me and hid, and
the aged rose up, they stood; 
Job
29:9  rulers held back their words, and
laid a hand on their mouth; 
Job
29:10  the voice of leaders was hushed,
and their tongue clung to the roof of their mouth. 
Job
29:11  For when the ear heard, it blessed
me, and when the eye saw, it gave witness of me; 
Job
29:12  because I rescued the poor who
cried out, and the fatherless who had no helper. 
Job
29:13  The blessing of the perishing one
would come upon me, and I made the widow’s heart sing for joy. 
Job
29:14  I put on righteousness, and it
robed me; right-ruling was my cloak and turban. 
Job
29:15  I was eyes to the blind, and I was
feet to the lame. 
Job
29:16  I was a father to the poor, and I
investigated the case which I did not know. 
Job
29:17  And I broke the jaws of the
perverse, and snatched the prey from his teeth. 
Job
29:18  Then I thought I would die in my
nest, and increase my days as the sand, 
Job
29:19  my root reaching out to the
waters, and dew lying all night on my branch, 
Job
29:20  my esteem fresh within me, and my
bow renewed in my hand. 
Job
29:21  To me they listened, and they
waited, and kept silence at my counsel. 
Job
29:22  After my words they did not speak
again, and my speech settled on them.
Job
29:23  And they waited for me like the
rain, and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain. 
Job
29:24  I smiled at those who did not
believe, and the light of my face they did not dim. 
Job
29:25  I chose the way for them, and sat
as chief, and I dwelt like a sovereign in the army, like one who comforts
mourners. 
Job
30:1  “But now they laugh at me, those
younger than I, whose fathers I would have refused to put with my sheep dogs. 
Job
30:2  Of what use to me is the strength
of their hands, since their manhood power has perished? 
Job
30:3  They are dried up from lack and
hunger, they flee to a parched land, formerly a waste and ruin. 
Job
30:4  They pluck salt herbs by the
bushes, and broom tree roots for their food. 
Job
30:5  They were driven out from among men, they shouted at them as at a thief,

Job
30:6  to dwell in the gullies of wadis,
holes of the ground and clefts. 
Job
30:7  Among the bushes they cry out,
under the nettles they huddled together – 
Job
30:8  sons of fools, even sons without a
name, they have been whipped out of the land. 
Job
30:9  And now I have become their song,
and I am a byword to them. 
Job
30:10  They have loathed me, they have
kept far from me, and did not refrain from spitting in my face. 
Job
30:11  Because He has loosed my bowstring
and afflicted me, they have thrown off restraint in my presence. 
Job
30:12  At my right hand a brood rises;
they pushed away my feet, and they raise up against me their destructive ways. 
Job
30:13  They have broken up my path, they
gain by my ruin; no one restrains them. 
Job
30:14  They come as through a wide breach; rushing on me under the ruins. 
Job
30:15  Destructions are turned upon me;
they pursue my life as the wind, and my welfare has passed like a cloud. 
Job
30:16  And now my life pours itself out;
days of affliction seize me. 
Job
30:17  My bones have been pierced in me
at night, and my gnawings never lie down. 
Job
30:18  By great exertion is my garment
changed – it girds me as the collar of my coat, 
Job
30:19  throwing me into the mud, and I
have become like dust and ashes. 
Job
30:20  I cry out to You, but You do not
answer me; I stand up, but You only
look at me. 
Job
30:21  You have become cruel to me; with
the power of Your hand You oppose me. 
Job
30:22  You lift me up to the wind, making
me to ride it; and You melt me in a storm. 
Job
30:23  For I have known that You bring me
to death, and to the house appointed for all living. 
Job
30:24  Yet does not one in a heap of
ruins stretch out his hand, or in calamity cry out for help? 
Job
30:25  Did I not weep for him who was in
trouble? Was my being not grieved for the poor? 
Job
30:26  When I looked for good, then evil
came to me. And when I waited for light, darkness came. 
Job
30:27  My inward parts boiled and did not
rest; days of affliction went before me. 
Job
30:28  I went about blackened, but not by
the sun; I stood up in the assembly, I cried for help. 
Job
30:29  I became a brother of jackals, and
a companion of ostriches. 
Job
30:30  My skin became black upon me, and
my bones burned with heat. 
Job
30:31  So my lyre becomes mourning, and
my flute the sound of weeping. 
Job
31:1  “I have made a covenant with my
eyes. How then could I gaze at a maiden? 
Job
31:2  For what is the portion of Eloah
from above, and the inheritance of the Almighty from on high? 
Job
31:3  Is it not calamity to the perverse,
and strangeness to the workers of wickedness? 
Job
31:4  Does He not see my ways, and number
all my steps? 
Job
31:5  If I have walked with falsehood, or
if my foot has hurried to deceit, 
Job
31:6  let Him weigh me in a right scale,
and let Eloah know my integrity. 
Job
31:7  If my step does turn from the way,
or my heart has gone after my eyes, or if any spot has clung to my hands, 
Job
31:8  let me sow, and another eat; and
let my harvest be rooted out. 
Job
31:9  If my heart has been enticed by a
woman, or if I have lurked at my neighbour’s door, 
Job
31:10  let my wife grind for another, and
let others bow down over her. 
Job
31:11  For that would be a wicked scheme,
and a punishable crookedness. 
Job
31:12  For that would be a fire that
burns to destruction, and take root among all my increase. 
Job
31:13  If I have refused the plea of my
male servant or my female servant when they complained against me, 
Job
31:14  then what should I do when Ĕl
rises up? And when He punishes, what should I answer Him? 
Job
31:15  Did not He who made me in the womb
make him? And did not One fashion us in the womb? 
Job
31:16  If I have withheld the poor from
pleasure, or caused the widow’s eyes to fail, 
Job
31:17  or eaten my piece of bread by
myself, and the fatherless did not eat of it – 
Job
31:18  but from my youth he grew up with
me as with a father, and from my
mother’s womb I guided her – 
Job
31:19  if I have seen anyone perish for
lack of garments, or a poor one without covering; 
Job
31:20  if his loins have not blessed me,
and he warmed himself with the fleece of my sheep; 
Job
31:21  if I have raised my hand against
the fatherless, when I saw I had help in the gate; 
Job
31:22  let my arm fall from my shoulder, and
my arm be broken from the bone. 
Job
31:23  For I am in dread of destruction
from Ĕl, and from His excellence I could not escape. 
Job
31:24  If I have put my trust in gold, or
called fine gold my refuge; 
Job
31:25  if I have rejoiced because my
wealth was great, and because my hand had gained much; 
Job
31:26  if I have looked at the sun when
it shines, or the moon moving in brightness, 
Job
31:27  so that my heart has been secretly
enticed, and my mouth has kissed my hand – 
Job
31:28  that too is a punishable
crookedness, for I would have denied Ĕl above. 
Job
31:29  If I have rejoiced when he who
hated me was ruined, or lifted myself up when evil found him – 
Job
31:30  also I have not allowed my mouth
to sin by asking for a curse on his life – 
Job
31:31  if the men of my tent did not say,
‘Who is there that has not been satisfied with his meat?’ 
Job
31:32  The stranger did not have to spend
the night in the street, for I have opened my doors to the way. 
Job
31:33  If I have covered my transgressions
like Aḏam, by hiding my crookedness in my bosom, 
Job
31:34  then let me fear the great crowd,
and dread the scorn of clans, then I would be silent, and go out of the door! 
Job
31:35  Who would give me a hearing? See,
my signature, let the Almighty answer me, and let my accuser write a bill! 
Job
31:36  Would I not take it up on my
shoulder, bind it on me for a crown? 
Job
31:37  I would declare to Him the number
of my steps – I would approach Him like a prince. 
Job
31:38  If my land cries out against me,
or its furrows weep together; 
Job
31:39  if I have eaten its fruit without
payment, or caused its owners to die; 
Job
31:40  let thistles grow instead of
wheat, and useless weed instead of barley.” The words of Iyoḇ are ended. 
Job
32:1  Then these three men ceased to
answer Iyoḇ, because he was righteous in his own eyes. 
Job
32:2  And the wrath of Elihu, son of Baraḵ’ĕl
the Buzite, of the clan of Ram, burned against Iyoḇ. His wrath burned
because he declared himself right rather than Elohim. 
Job
32:3  And against his three friends his
wrath burned, because they had found no answer, and pronounced Elohim wrong. 
Job
32:4  And because they were years older
than he, Elihu had waited to speak to Iyoḇ. 
Job
32:5  And when Elihu saw that there was
no answer in the mouth of these three men, his wrath burned. 
Job
32:6  And Elihu, son of Baraḵ’ĕl
the Buzite, responded and said, “I am young in years, and you are aged.
Therefore I was afraid to let you know my opinion. 
Job
32:7  I said, ‘Days should speak, and
many years should teach wisdom.’ 
Job
32:8  But truly it is the spirit in man
and the breath of the Almighty that gives him understanding. 
Job
32:9  The multitude are not wise, nor do
the aged understand right-ruling. 
Job
32:10  Therefore I have said, ‘Listen to
me, let me also make my opinion known to you.’ 
Job
32:11  Look, I waited for your words, I
listened to your reasonings, while you searched out what to say. 
Job
32:12  And I paid close attention to you.
But look, not one of you proved Iyoḇ wrong, nor answered his words. 
Job
32:13  Lest you say, ‘We have found
wisdom’ – it is Ĕl that drives him away, not man. 
Job
32:14  Now he has not ordered words
against me, so I would not answer him with your words. 
Job
32:15  They have broken down; they have
not answered again; words have departed from them. 
Job
32:16  And I have waited, but they do not
speak, because they have stood still, they answered no more. 
Job
32:17  Let me answer on my part, let me
also make my opinion known. 
Job
32:18  For I am filled with words; the
spirit within me presses me. 
Job
32:19  See, within me it is like wine not
opened; it shall burst like new wineskins. 
Job
32:20  Let me speak, so that I find
relief; let me open my lips and answer. 
Job
32:21  Please, let me not show partiality
to anyone, nor let me flatter any man. 
Job
32:22  For I do not know how to flatter,
lest my Maker should soon take me away! 
Job
33:1  “And yet, O Iyoḇ, please hear
my speech and listen to all my words. 
Job
33:2  See, please! I shall open my mouth,
my tongue shall speak in my mouth. 
Job
33:3  My words are from the uprightness
of my heart, my lips shall speak knowledge clearly. 
Job
33:4  The Spirit of Ĕl has made me,
and the breath of the Almighty gives me life. 
Job
33:5  If you are able, answer me, set
yourself in order before me, take your stand. 
Job
33:6  See, I am like you before Ĕl,
I too have been formed out of clay. 
Job
33:7  See, no fear of me should alarm
you, nor should pressure by me be heavy on you. 
Job
33:8  But you have spoken in my hearing,
and the sound of words I hear, saying,

Job
33:9  ‘I am clear, without transgression;
I am innocent, and I have no crookedness. 
Job
33:10  See, He finds occasions against
me, He counts me as His enemy; 
Job
33:11  He puts my feet in the stocks, He
watches all my paths.’ 
Job
33:12  See, in this you have not been
righteous. Let me answer you: Eloah is greater than man! 
Job
33:13  Why have you complained against
Him? Because He does not answer all His matters? 
Job
33:14  For Ĕl does speak once, or
twice – though one does not notice it
– 
Job
33:15  in a dream, in a vision of the
night, when deep sleep falls upon men, while slumbering on a bed, 
Job
33:16  then He opens the ears of men, and
seals their instruction, 
Job
33:17  to turn man from his deed, and conceal pride from man. 
Job
33:18  He keeps back his being from the
Pit, and his life from passing away by the sword. 
Job
33:19  And he is reproved with pain on
his bed, and with unceasing distress in his bones, 
Job
33:20  so that his life loathes bread,
and his being desirable food. 
Job
33:21  His flesh wastes away, and his
bones which were not seen stick out. 
Job
33:22  And his being draws near the Pit,
and his life to the destroyers. 
Job
33:23  If there is a messenger for him, a
mediator, one among a thousand, to show man His straightness, 
Job
33:24  then He shows favour to him, and
says, ‘Release him from going down to the Pit, I have found an atonement. 
Job
33:25  ‘Let his flesh become fresher than
a child’s, let him return to the days of his youth.’ 
Job
33:26  He prays to Eloah, and He accepts
him. And he sees His face with joy, and He restores to man his righteousness. 
Job
33:27  He sings to men and says, ‘I have
sinned, and I have perverted what was right, and it did not profit me.’ 
Job
33:28  He has redeemed my being from
going down to the Pit, and my life sees the light. 
Job
33:29  See, Ĕl does all these –
twice, three times with a man, 
Job
33:30  to bring back his being from the
Pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living. 
Job
33:31  Pay attention, Iyoḇ, listen
to me, keep silent, and let me speak. 
Job
33:32  If there are words, answer me;
speak, for I desire to declare you right. 
Job
33:33  If not, listen to me, keep silent,
and let me teach you wisdom.” 
Job
34:1  Then Elihu responded and said, 
Job
34:2  “Hear my words, you wise men; give
ear to me, you who have knowledge. 
Job
34:3  For the ear tries words as the
palate tastes food. 
Job
34:4  Let us choose what is right for us;
let us know among us what is good. 
Job
34:5  For Iyoḇ has said, ‘I am
righteous, but Ĕl has taken away my right. 
Job
34:6  Would I lie concerning my right? My
wound is incurable – without transgression.’ 
Job
34:7  What man is like Iyoḇ, who
drinks mocking like water, 
Job
34:8  who goes in company with the
workers of wickedness, and walks with men of wrongness? 
Job
34:9  For he has said, ‘It does not
profit a man that he takes delight in Elohim.’ 
Job
34:10  Therefore, listen to me, you men
of heart: far be it from Ĕl to do wrong, and from the Almighty to commit
unrighteousness. 
Job
34:11  For He repays man’s work to him,
and makes man to find a reward according to his path. 
Job
34:12  The truth is, Ĕl does not do
wrong, and the Almighty does not twist right-ruling. 
Job
34:13  Who has assigned to Him the earth?
And who has laid out all the world? 
Job
34:14  If He sets His heart on him, should
He gather to Himself his spirit and his breath, 
Job
34:15  all flesh would expire together
and man return to dust. 
Job
34:16  If you have understanding, hear this! Give ear to the sound of my
words: 
Job
34:17  Should the one who hates
right-ruling govern? Or would you declare a most righteous one wrong? 
Job
34:18  Who shall say to a sovereign: ‘Beliya‛al,’
to nobles: ‘Wrong one’? –
Job
34:19  who is not partial to princes, nor
regards the rich more than the poor? For they are all the work of His hands. 
Job
34:20  In a moment they die, in the
middle of the night; the people are shaken and pass away; and the mighty are
taken away without a hand. 
Job
34:21  For His eyes are on the ways of
man, and He sees all his steps. 
Job
34:22  There is no darkness nor shadow of
death where the workers of wickedness hide themselves. 
Job
34:23  For He sets a man no stated time
to appear before Ĕl in right-ruling. 
Job
34:24  He breaks in pieces the mighty,
without inquiry, and puts others in their place. 
Job
34:25  Truly, He knows their works, and
He shall overthrow in the night, and they are crushed. 
Job
34:26  As wrong ones He slaps them in the
presence of onlookers, 
Job
34:27  because they turned from following
Him, and they regarded not all His ways, 
Job
34:28  so as to cause the cry of the poor
to come to Him; for He hears the cry of the afflicted. 
Job
34:29  And when He is silent, who would
then condemn? And when He hides His face, who then sees Him, whether it is
against a nation or a man alone? 
Job
34:30  So that a defiled one should not
reign, lest the people be ensnared. 
Job
34:31  For has anyone said to Ĕl, ‘I
have taken away, I do not act corruptly. 
Job
34:32  ‘Teach me what I do not see. If I
have done unrighteousness, I shall not do so again’? 
Job
34:33  Should He repay you because you
have refused? For you choose, and not I, therefore speak what you know. 
Job
34:34  Let men of heart say to me, and a
wise man who listens to me: 
Job
34:35  ‘Iyoḇ does not speak with
knowledge, and his words are without wisdom.’ 
Job
34:36  Would that Iyoḇ be tried to
the end, since his answers are like those of wicked men! 
Job
34:37  For he adds rebellion to his sin –
he claps his hands among us, and
multiplies his words against Ĕl.” 
Job
35:1  And Elihu responded and said,
Job
35:2  “Do you think this is right? Do you
say, ‘My righteousness is more than that of Ĕl’? 
Job
35:3  For you say, ‘Of what use is it to
you? What do I gain more than if I had sinned?’ 
Job
35:4  Let me answer you and your friends
with you. 
Job
35:5  Look to the heavens, and see. And
consider the clouds which are higher than you. 
Job
35:6  If you sin, what would you do
against Him? If your transgressions are increased, what would you do to Him? 
Job
35:7  If you are righteous, what do you
give Him? Or what does He receive from your hand? 
Job
35:8  Your wrong is for a man like
yourself, and your righteousness for a son of man. 
Job
35:9  Because of the multitude of
oppressions they cry out; they cry out for help because of the arm of the many.

Job
35:10  And no one says, ‘Where is Eloah
my Maker, who gives songs in the night, 
Job
35:11  teaching us more than the beasts
of the earth, and makes us wiser than the birds of the heavens?’ 
Job
35:12  There they cry, but He answers not,
because of the pride of evil ones. 
Job
35:13  Only, it is false that Ĕl
does not hear, and that the Almighty pays no attention to it.
Job
35:14  Although you say you do not see
Him, yet right-ruling is before Him, and you wait for Him. 
Job
35:15  And now, is it for naught that His
displeasure has come? Yet He has not taken note of extreme arrogance, 
Job
35:16  so Iyoḇ opens his mouth in
vain, he increases words without knowledge.” 
Job
36:1  Then Elihu continued and said,
Job
36:2  “Bear with me a little, and let me
show you there is still more to say for Elohim. 
Job
36:3  I bring my knowledge from afar and
ascribe righteousness to my Maker. 
Job
36:4  For truly my words are not false;
the One perfect in knowledge is with you. 
Job
36:5  See, Ĕl is mighty, but rejects
no one – mighty in power and heart. 
Job
36:6  He does not keep the wrongdoer
alive, but He gives right-ruling to
the oppressed ones. 
Job
36:7  He does not withdraw His eyes from
the righteous, and sovereigns on the throne, and seats them forever, and they
are exalted. 
Job
36:8  And if they are bound in shackles,
caught in the cords of affliction, 
Job
36:9  then He reveals to them their work,
and their transgressions, that they behaved proudly. 
Job
36:10  And He opens their ear for
discipline, and commands that they turn back from wickedness. 
Job
36:11  If they obey and serve, they
complete their days in blessedness, and their years in pleasantness. 
Job
36:12  But if they do not obey, they
perish by the sword, and die without knowledge. 
Job
36:13  But the defiled ones in heart
become enraged – let them not cry for help when He binds them. 
Job
36:14  Their being dies in youth, and
their life among the male prostitutes. 
Job
36:15  He rescues the afflicted one in
his affliction, and opens their ears in oppression. 
Job
36:16  And He also would have brought you
out of distress, into a broad place where there is no restraint. And what is
set on your table would be filled with rich food. 
Job
36:17  But you are filled with the
judgment of the wrong, judgment and right-ruling take hold of you. 
Job
36:18  Beware, that rage does not entice you to scoffing. And do not let a
large bribe turn you aside. 
Job
36:19  Would He value your riches? No,
not precious ore, nor all your strength! 
Job
36:20  Do not long for the night, when
people go up in their place. 
Job
36:21  Beware, do not turn to wickedness,
for you have chosen this rather than affliction. 
Job
36:22  See, Ĕl is exalted by His
power; who is a Teacher like Him? 
Job
36:23  Who has appointed Him His way, or
who has said, ‘You have worked unrighteousness’? 
Job
36:24  Remember to extol His work, of
which men have sung. 
Job
36:25  All men have seen it, man looks on
it from afar. 
Job
36:26  See, Ĕl is great, beyond our under-standing,
and we do not know the number of His years. 
Job
36:27  For He draws up drops of water,
which distil as rain from the mist, 
Job
36:28  which the clouds drop down – pour
down in showers on man. 
Job
36:29  Also, who understands the spreading
of clouds, the crashing from His booth? 
Job
36:30  See, He has spread his light upon
it, and He has covered the depths of the sea. 
Job
36:31  For by these He judges the
peoples; He gives plenty of food. 
Job
36:32  He has covered His hands with
lightning, and commands it to strike. 
Job
36:33  Its noise declares concerning Him,
also the cattle, as to what is coming up. 
Job
37:1  “At this too my heart trembles, and
leaps from its place. 
Job
37:2  Listen, listen to the trembling of
His voice, and the sound that comes from His mouth. 
Job
37:3  He lets it loose under all the
heavens, and His lightning to the ends of the earth. 
Job
37:4  After it a voice roars. He thunders
with the voice of His excellency, and He does not hold them back when His voice
is heard. 
Job
37:5  Ĕl thunders wondrously with
His voice; doing great deeds, which we do not understand. 
Job
37:6  For He says to the snow, ‘Be on the
earth,’ also to the gentle rain and the heavy rain of His strength. 
Job
37:7  He seals up the hand of every man,
for all men to know His work. 
Job
37:8  Then the beast goes into its lair,
and they stay in their dens. 
Job
37:9  From the room of the south comes
the whirlwind, and cold from the scattering winds of the north. 
Job
37:10  By the breath of Ĕl ice is
given, and the expanse of water becomes solid. 
Job
37:11  He also loads the thick clouds
with moisture; He scatters His bright clouds. 
Job
37:12  And they swirl about, being turned
by His guidance, to do whatever He commands them on the face of the earthly
world. 
Job
37:13  He causes it to come, whether as a
rod, or for His land, or for kindness. 
Job
37:14  Listen to this, O Iyoḇ,
stand still and consider the wonders of Ĕl. 
Job
37:15  Do you know when Eloah placed them,
and caused the lightning of His cloud to shine? 
Job
37:16  Do you know the balancing of the
clouds, the wonders of the One perfect in knowledge? 
Job
37:17  Why are your garments hot, when
the earth is stilled from the south? 
Job
37:18  Did you, with Him, spread out the
clouds, strong as a hard mirror? 
Job
37:19  Teach us what we should say to
Him; we do not set in order because of darkness. 
Job
37:20  Should He be told that I would
speak? Would any man ask to be swallowed up? 
Job
37:21  And now, they shall not look on
the light that is bright behind the clouds, when the wind has passed and
cleared them. 
Job
37:22  From the golden north it comes –
with Eloah is awesome excellency. 
Job
37:23  The Almighty, we have not found
Him out, He is exalted in power and right-ruling and great in righteousness –
He does not oppress. 
Job
37:24  Therefore men fear Him. He does
not regard any who are wise of heart.” 
Job
38:1  Then יהוה
answered Iyoḇ out of the whirlwind, and said, 
Job
38:2  “Who is this who darkens counsel by
words without knowledge? 
Job
38:3  Now gird up your loins like a man,
and I ask you, and you answer Me. 
Job
38:4  Where were you when I laid the
foundations of the earth? Declare, if you have understanding. 
Job
38:5  Who set its measurements, if you
know? Or who stretched the line upon it? 
Job
38:6  Upon what were its foundations
sunk? Or who laid its corner-stone, 
Job
38:7  when the morning stars sang
together, and all the sons of Elohim shouted for joy? 
Job
38:8  Or who enclosed the sea with doors, when it burst forth and came from
the womb; 
Job
38:9  when I made the clouds its garment,
and thick darkness its swaddling band; 
Job
38:10  and assigned for it My law, and
set bars and doors; 
Job
38:11  and said, ‘This far you have come,
but no farther, and here your proud waves stop?’ 
Job
38:12  Have you ever commanded the
morning, and caused the dawn to know its place, 
Job
38:13  to take hold of the ends of the
earth, and the wrong be shaken out of it? 
Job
38:14  It is changed like clay under a
seal, and they stand out like a garment. 
Job
38:15  And their light is withheld from
the wrong, and the arm lifted up is broken. 
Job
38:16  Have you come to the sources of
the sea? Or have you walked about in the recesses of the deep? 
Job
38:17  Were the gates of death revealed
to you? Or have you seen the gates of the shadow of death? 
Job
38:18  Have you understood the breadth of
the earth? Declare, if you know it all. 
Job
38:19  Where is the way to the dwelling
of light? And darkness, where is its place, 
Job
38:20  that you should take it to its
boundary, and know the paths to its home? 
Job
38:21  Do you know? For you would have
been born then, and the number of your days been many! 
Job
38:22  Have you entered into the storehouses
of snow, or have you seen the storehouses of hail, 
Job
38:23  which I have kept for the time of
distress, for the day of fighting and battle? 
Job
38:24  Where is the way that light is
divided, or the east wind scattered over the earth? 
Job
38:25  Who has cleft a channel for the
overflowing water, or a way for the thunderclaps, 
Job
38:26  to make rain fall on land where no
one is, a wilderness in which there is no man; 
Job
38:27  to satisfy the wild and waste
places, and to make the seeds of grass to sprout? 
Job
38:28  Does the rain have a father? Or
who has brought forth the drops of dew? 
Job
38:29  From whose belly comes the ice?
And who gave birth to the frost of the heavens? 
Job
38:30  The waters harden like stone, and
the surface of the deep is frozen. 
Job
38:31  Do you bind the bands of Kimah, or
loosen the cords of Kesil? 
Job
38:32  Do you bring out the
constellations in its season? Or do you lead the Bear with its sons? 
Job
38:33  Do you know the laws of the
heavens? Or do you set their rule over the earth? 
Job
38:34  Do you lift up your voice to the
clouds, so that floods of water cover you? 
Job
38:35  Do you send out lightnings, and
they go and say to you, ‘Here we are!’? 
Job
38:36  Who has put wisdom in the inward
parts? Or who has given understanding to the heart? 
Job
38:37  Who has wisdom to count the
clouds, or to tip over the bottles of the heavens, 
Job
38:38  when the dust hardens in clumps,
and the clods cling together? 
Job
38:39  Do you hunt the prey for the lion,
or satisfy the appetite of the young lions, 
Job
38:40  when they crouch in dens, sit in
the cover of their hiding place? 
Job
38:41  Who provides food for the raven,
when its young ones cry to Ĕl, and
wander about without food? 
Job
39:1  “Do you know the time when the wild
mountain goats bear young? Or do you observe when the deer gives birth? 
Job
39:2  Do you number the months they
complete? Or do you know the time when they bear young? 
Job
39:3  They bow down, they bring forth
their young, their labour pains are ended. 
Job
39:4  Their young ones are thriving, they
grow up in the field. They shall leave and shall not return to them. 
Job
39:5  Who set the wild donkey free? Who
loosed the bonds of the wild donkey, 
Job
39:6  whose home I have made the desert,
and the salt land his dwelling? 
Job
39:7  He laughs at the commotion of the
city; he does not hear the shouts of the driver. 
Job
39:8  The range of the mountains is his
pasture, and he searches for all that is green. 
Job
39:9  Would the wild ox be pleased to
serve you? Or spend the night by your feeding trough? 
Job
39:10  If you bind the wild ox in the
furrow with ropes, would he plough the valleys behind you? 
Job
39:11  Would you rely on his great strength?
Or would you leave your labour to him? 
Job
39:12  Would you trust him to bring home
your grain, and gather it to your threshing-floor? 
Job
39:13  The wings of the ostrich flap
joyously, but they are not the pinions and plumage of kindness! 
Job
39:14  She leaves her eggs on the ground,
and warms them in the dust; 
Job
39:15  and she forgets that a foot might
crush them, or a wild beast tread on them. 
Job
39:16  She treats her young harshly, as
if not hers; her toil is in vain, without fear, 
Job
39:17  because Eloah has made her forget
wisdom, and did not endow her with understanding. 
Job
39:18  When she lifts herself on high,
she laughs at the horse and its rider. 
Job
39:19  Have you given the horse strength?
Have you covered his neck with a mane? 
Job
39:20  Would you make him leap like a
locust? His splendid snorting is frightening. 
Job
39:21  He paws in the valley, and
rejoices in strength. He gallops into the clash of arms. 
Job
39:22  He laughs at fear, and is not
frightened; nor does he turn back from the sword. 
Job
39:23  The quiver rattles against him,
the glittering spear and lance. 
Job
39:24  He eats up the ground with
fierceness and rage, and he does not stand still when the ram’s horn sounds. 
Job
39:25  At the blast of the ram’s horn he
says, ‘Aha!’ And from afar he smells the battle, the thunder of commanders and
shouting. 
Job
39:26  Does the hawk fly by your wisdom,
spreading its wings toward the south? 
Job
39:27  Does the eagle mount up at your
command, and make its nest on high? 
Job
39:28  It dwells on the rock, and lodges
on the crag of the rock and the stronghold. 
Job
39:29  From there it searches out the
prey, its eyes see it from afar. 
Job
39:30  And its young ones suck up blood.
And where the slain are, there it is!” 
Job
40:1  And יהוה
answered Iyoḇ, and said,
Job
40:2  “Should a reprover contend with the
Almighty? Let him who reproves Eloah answer it.” 
Job
40:3  And Iyoḇ answered יהוה
and said, 
Job
40:4  “See, I am insignificant, what
would I answer You? I lay my hand over my mouth. 
Job
40:5  Once I have spoken, but I have no
answer – and twice, but I say no more.” 
Job
40:6  Then יהוה
answered Iyoḇ out of the whirlwind, and said, 
Job
40:7  “Now gird up your loins like a man;
I ask you, and you answer Me. 
Job
40:8  Would you also set aside My
judgment? Would you pronounce Me wrong, and you be declared righteous? 
Job
40:9  Or do you have an arm like Ĕl?
Or do you thunder with a voice like His? 
Job
40:10  Deck yourself, please, with
excellency and grandeur, and put on esteem and splendour. 
Job
40:11  Scatter abroad the rage of your
wrath, and look on everyone who is proud and bring him low. 
Job
40:12  Look on everyone who is proud,
humble him. And tread down the wrong-doers in their place. 
Job
40:13  Hide them in the dust together,
bind their faces in obscurity. 
Job
40:14  Then even I would confess to you
that your own right hand does save you. 
Job
40:15  See now, Behĕmoth, which I
made along with you – he eats grass like an ox. 
Job
40:16  See now, his strength is in his
loins, and his power is in his stomach muscles. 
Job
40:17  He bends his tail like a cedar;
the sinews of his thighs are knit together. 
Job
40:18  His bones are like tubes of
bronze, his ribs like bars of iron. 
Job
40:19  He is the beginning of the ways of
Ĕl. His Maker brings near His sword. 
Job
40:20  For the mountains yield food for
him, and all the beasts of the field play there. 
Job
40:21  He lies under the slender trees,
under cover of reed and swamp. 
Job
40:22  The slender trees cover him with
their shade; the willows by the stream surround him. 
Job
40:23  See, if a river rages, he is not
alarmed; he feels safe, even if the Yardĕn gushes into his mouth, 
Job
40:24  Before his eyes, shall he be
caught, with snares? Or his nose
pierced? 
Job
41:1  “Would you draw out Liwiathan with
a hook, or snare his tongue with a line which you lower? 
Job
41:2  Would you put a cord through his
nose, or pierce his jaw with a hook? 
Job
41:3  Would he keep on pleading with you?
Would he speak softly to you? 
Job
41:4  Would he make a covenant with you
to be taken as a servant forever? 
Job
41:5  Would you play with him as with a
bird? Or leash him for your young girls? 
Job
41:6  Would trading partners bargain over him? Would they divide him among the
merchants? 
Job
41:7  Fill his skin with harpoons? Or his
head with fishing spears? 
Job
41:8  Put your hand on him – think of the
struggle! Do not do it again! 
Job
41:9  See, any expectation of him is
disappointed – he is laid low even at the sight of him! 
Job
41:10  No one is so foolhardy to wake him
up. Who then is able to stand against Me? 
Job
41:11  Who has given to Me first, that I
should repay him – under all the heavens that is Mine? 
Job
41:12  I would not keep silent concerning
his limbs, or his mighty power, or his fair frame. 
Job
41:13  Who shall take off the surface of
his skin? Who approaches him with a double bridle? 
Job
41:14  Who shall open the doors of his
face, with his frightening teeth all around? 
Job
41:15  Rows of scales are his pride – closed up, a binding seal. 
Job
41:16  One to the other they fit closely,
not even a breath enters between them. 
Job
41:17  They are joined one to another,
they stick together and are not separated. 
Job
41:18  His sneezings flash forth light,
and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning. 
Job
41:19  Out of his mouth go firebrands –
sparks of fire shoot out. 
Job
41:20  Out of his nostrils comes smoke,
like a boiling pot or kettle. 
Job
41:21  His breath sets coals on fire, and
a flame goes out of his mouth. 
Job
41:22  Strength dwells in his neck, and
fear leaps before him. 
Job
41:23  The folds of his flesh cleave
together. They are firm on him, immovable. 
Job
41:24  His heart is as hard as stone,
even as hard as the lower millstone. 
Job
41:25  When he raises himself up, the
mighty are afraid. Because of his crashings they are bewildered. 
Job
41:26  No sword that reaches him does
prevail, neither spear, dart, or
lance. 
Job
41:27  He reckons iron as straw, bronze
as rotten wood. 
Job
41:28  The arrow does not make him flee,
sling-stones become like stubble to him. 
Job
41:29  Clubs are reckoned as straw, he
laughs at the rattle of a lance. 
Job
41:30  His undersides are like sharp
potsherds. He sprawls on the mud like a threshing-sledge. 
Job
41:31  He makes the deep boil like a pot,
he makes the sea like a pot of ointment. 
Job
41:32  He leaves a shining path behind
him. One would think the deep to be grey-haired. 
Job
41:33  No one on earth is like him – one
made without fear. 
Job
41:34  He sees all that is haughty. He is
sovereign over all the sons of pride.” 
Job
42:1  And Iyoḇ answered יהוה
and said,
Job
42:2  “You know that You are able to do all,
and that no purpose is withheld from You. 
Job
42:3  Who is this that hides counsel
without knowledge? Therefore I declared but I did not understand, matters too marvellous for me, which I
did not know. 
Job
42:4  Listen, please, and let me speak. I
ask You, then would You make it known to me?’ 
Job
42:5  I have heard of You by the hearing
of the ear, but now my eye sees You. 
Job
42:6  Therefore I despise myself, and repent in dust and ashes.” 
Job
42:7  And it came to be, after יהוה
had spoken these words to Iyoḇ, that יהוה said to
Eliphaz the Tĕmanite, “My wrath has burned against you and your two
friends, for you have not spoken of Me what is right, as did My servant Iyoḇ.

Job
42:8  And now, take seven bulls and seven
rams, and go to My servant Iyoḇ, and offer up a burnt offering for
yourselves. And let My servant Iyoḇ pray for you – for I accept him –
lest I punish you; because you have not spoken of Me what is right, as did My
servant Iyoḇ.” 
Job
42:9  So Eliphaz the Tĕmanite and
Bildaḏ the Shuḥite, Tsophar the Na‛amathite went and did as יהוה
commanded them. And יהוה accepted the face of Iyoḇ.

Job
42:10  And יהוה
turned the captivity of Iyoḇ when he prayed for his friends. And יהוה
gave Iyoḇ twice as much as he had before. 
Job
42:11  And all his brothers, and all his
sisters, and all those who had been his friends before, came to him and ate
food with him in his house. And they sympathised with him and comforted him for
all the evil that יהוה had brought upon him. And they
each gave him a piece of silver and each one a ring of gold. 
Job
42:12  And יהוה
blessed the latter days of Iyoḇ more than his beginning; for he had
fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and one thousand yoke of
oxen, and one thousand female donkeys. 
Job
42:13  And he had seven sons and three
daughters. 
Job
42:14  And he called the name of the
first Yemimah, and the name of the second Qetsi‛ah, and the name of the
third Qeren-Happuḵ. 
Job
42:15  And in all the land were found no
women so pretty as the daughters of Iyoḇ. And their father gave them an
inheritance among their brothers. 
Job
42:16  And after this Iyoḇ lived
one hundred and forty years, and saw his children and grandchildren for four
generations. 
Job
42:17  And Iyoḇ died, old and
satisfied with days.
