Neḥemyah/Nehemiah
Nehem
1:1  The words of Neḥemyah son of Ḥaḵalyah.
And it came to be in the month of Kislĕw, in the twentieth year, as I was
in the citadel of Shushan, 
Nehem
1:2  that Ḥanani, one of my
brothers, came with men from Yehuḏah. And I asked them concerning the
Yehuḏim who had escaped, who had survived the captivity, and concerning
Yerushalayim. 
Nehem
1:3  And they said to me, “The remnant
who are left of the captivity in the province are there in great evil and
reproach. And the wall of Yerushalayim is broken down, and its gates are burned
with fire.” 
Nehem
1:4  And it came to be, when I heard
these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned for many days. And I was
fasting and praying before the Elohim of the heavens, 
Nehem
1:5  and I said, “I pray, יהוה
Elohim of the heavens, O great and awesome Ĕl, guarding the covenant and
kindness with those who love You, and with those guarding Your commands, 
Nehem
1:6  please let Your ear be attentive and
Your eyes open, to hear the prayer of Your servant which I am praying before
You now, day and night, for the children of Yisra’ĕl Your servants, and
confess the sins of the children of Yisra’ĕl which we have sinned against
You. Both my father’s house and I have sinned. 
Nehem
1:7  “We have acted very corruptly
against You, and have not guarded the commands, nor the laws, nor the
right-rulings which You commanded Your servant Mosheh. 
Nehem
1:8  “Please remember the word that You
commanded Your servant Mosheh, saying, ‘If you trespass, I shall scatter you
among the peoples, 
Nehem
1:9  but if you shall turn back to Me,
and guard My commands and do them, though you were cast out to the end of the
heavens, I shall gather them from there, and bring them to the place which I
have chosen, to make My Name dwell there.’ 
Nehem
1:10  “And they are Your servants and
Your people, whom You have redeemed by Your great power, and by Your strong
hand. 
Nehem
1:11  “O יהוה, I
pray, please let Your ear be attentive to the prayer of Your servant, and to the
prayer of Your servants who delight to fear Your Name. And let Your servant
prosper this day, I pray, and grant him compassion in the presence of this man.”
For I was cupbearer to the sovereign.
Nehem
2:1  And it came to be in the month of
Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaḥshashta the sovereign, when wine was
before him, that I took the wine and gave it to the sovereign. And I had never
been sad in his presence. 
Nehem
2:2  And the sovereign said to me, “Why
is your face sad, since you are not sick? This is none else but sorrow of
heart.” Then I was very much afraid, 
Nehem
2:3  and said to the sovereign, “Let the
sovereign live forever! Why should my face not be sad, when the city, the place
of my fathers’ tombs, lies waste, and its gates are burned with fire?” 
Nehem
2:4  And the sovereign said to me, “What
are you asking for?” Then I prayed to the Elohim of the heavens, 
Nehem
2:5  and said to the sovereign, “If it
seems good to the sovereign, and if your servant is pleasing before you, I ask
that you send me to Yehuḏah, to the city of my fathers’ tombs, so that I
build it.” 
Nehem
2:6  And the sovereign, with the
sovereigness sitting beside him, said to me, “How long would your journey take?
And when do you return?” So it seemed good before the sovereign to send me. And
I set him a time. 
Nehem
2:7  And I said to the sovereign, “If it
seems good to the sovereign, let letters be given to me for the governors
beyond the River, that they should let me to pass through till I come to Yehuḏah,

Nehem
2:8  and a letter to Asaph the keeper of
the sovereign’s forest, that he should give me timber to make beams for the
gates of the palace that belongs to the House, and for the city wall, and for
the house I would enter.” And the sovereign gave them to me according to the
good hand of my Elohim upon me. 
Nehem
2:9  Then I came to the governors beyond
the River, and gave to them the letters of the sovereign. Now the sovereign had
sent commanders of the army and horsemen with me. 
Nehem
2:10  And Sanballat the Ḥoronite
and Toḇiyah the Ammonite official heard of it, and to them it was evil, a
great evil that a man had come to seek good for the children of Yisra’ĕl. 
Nehem
2:11  Then I came to Yerushalayim and was
there three days. 
Nehem
2:12  And I rose up in the night, I and a
few men with me, but informed no one what my Elohim had put in my heart to do
at Yerushalayim, nor was there any beast with me, except the beast on which I
rode. 
Nehem
2:13  And I went out by night through the
Valley Gate to the Jackals’ Fountain and the Dung Gate, and examined the walls
of Yerushalayim which were broken down and its gates which were burned with
fire. 
Nehem
2:14  And I went on to the Fountain Gate
and to the Sovereign’s Pool, but there was no room for the beast that was under
me to pass. 
Nehem
2:15  And I went up in the night by the
wadi, and examined the wall, and turned back, and entered by the Valley Gate,
and returned. 
Nehem
2:16  And the deputy rulers did not know
where I had gone nor what I had done. Nor had I yet informed the Yehuḏim,
or the priests, or the nobles, or the deputy rulers, or the others who did the
work. 
Nehem
2:17  Then I said to them, “You see the
evil which we are in, how Yerushalayim lies waste, and its gates are burned
with fire. Come and let us build the wall of Yerushalayim, and let us no longer
be a reproach.” 
Nehem
2:18  And I informed them of the hand of
my Elohim which had been good upon me, and also of the sovereign’s words he had
spoken to me. And they said, “Let us rise up and we shall build.” So they made
their hands strong for good. 
Nehem
2:19  But when Sanballat the Ḥoronite
heard, and Toḇiyah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Araḇ,
they mocked us and despised us, and said, “What is this you are doing? Are you
rebelling against the sovereign?” 
Nehem
2:20  And I answered them, and said to
them, “The Elohim of the heavens, He shall bless us and let us, His servants,
rise and build, but you have no portion or right or remembrance in
Yerushalayim.” 
Nehem
3:1  And Elyashiḇ the high priest
rose up with his brothers the priests and built the Sheep Gate. They set it
apart and set up its doors, even as far as the Tower of Ḥanan’ĕl
they set it apart, as far as the Tower of Ḥanane’ĕl. 
Nehem
3:2  And next to him the men of Yeriḥo
built. And next to them Zakkur son of Imri built. 
Nehem
3:3  And the sons of Hassena’ah built the
Fish Gate, who laid its beams and set up its doors, its bolts and bars. 
Nehem
3:4  And next to them Merĕmoth son
of Uriyah, son of Qots, made repairs. And next to them Meshullam son of Bereḵyah,
son of Meshĕyzaḇ’ĕl, made repairs. And next to them Tsaḏoq
son of Ba‛ana made repairs. 
Nehem
3:5  And next to them the Teqowites made
repairs, but their nobles did not put their shoulders to the work of their
Master. 
Nehem
3:6  And Yehoyaḏa son of Pasĕaḥ
and Meshullam son of Besoḏeyah repaired the Old Gate. They laid its beams
and set up its doors, and its bolts and its bars. 
Nehem
3:7  And next to them Melatyah the Giḇ‛onite,
and Yaḏon the Mĕronothite, the men of Giḇ‛on and
Mitspah, repaired the official seat of the governor beyond the River. 
Nehem
3:8  Next to him Uzzi’ĕl son of Ḥarhayah,
one of the goldsmiths, made repairs. And next to him Ḥananyah, one of the
perfumers, made repairs. And they restored Yerushalayim as far as the Broad
Wall. 
Nehem
3:9  And next to them Rephayah son of Ḥur,
ruler of half the district of Yerushalayim, made repairs. 
Nehem
3:10  And next to them Yeḏayah son
of Ḥarumaph made repairs, even opposite his house. And next to him Ḥattush
son of Ḥashaḇneyah made repairs. 
Nehem
3:11  Malkiyah son of Ḥarim and Ḥashshuḇ
son of Paḥath-Mo’aḇ repaired another section, and the Tower of the
Ovens. 
Nehem
3:12  And next to him Shallum son of
Halloḥĕsh ruler of half the district of Yerushalayim made repairs,
he and his daughters. 
Nehem
3:13  Ḥanun and the people of
Zanowaḥ repaired the Valley Gate. They built it, and set up its doors,
its bolts and bars – and a thousand cubits of the wall as far as the Dung Gate.

Nehem
3:14  And the Dung Gate was repaired by
Malkiyah son of Rĕḵaḇ, ruler of the district of Bĕyth
Hakkerem. He built it and set up its doors, its bolts and bars. 
Nehem
3:15  And the Fountain Gate was repaired
by Shallun son of Kol-Ḥozeh, ruler of the district of Mitspah. He built
it and covered it, and set up its doors, its bolts and bars – also the wall of
the Pool of Shelaḥ by the Sovereign’s Garden, as far as the stairs going
down from the City of Dawiḏ. 
Nehem
3:16  After him Neḥemyah son of
Azbuq, ruler of half the district of Bĕyth Tsur, made repairs as far as
opposite the tombs of Dawiḏ, and to the man-made pool, and as far as the
house of the mighty men. 
Nehem
3:17  After him the Lĕwites,
Reḥum son of Bani, made repairs. Next to him repaired Ḥashaḇyah,
ruler of half the district of Qe‛ilah, for his district. 
Nehem
3:18  After him their brothers, Bawwai
son of Ḥĕnaḏaḏ, ruler of the other half of the district
of Qe‛ilah, made repairs. 
Nehem
3:19  And next to him Ĕzer son of Yĕshua,
the ruler of Mitspah, repaired another section before the going up to the
armoury at the corner. 
Nehem
3:20  After him Baruḵ son of Zabbai
eagerly repaired the other section, from the buttress to the door of the house
of Elyashiḇ the high priest. 
Nehem
3:21  After him Merĕmoth son of
Uriyah, son of Qots, repaired another section, from the door of the house of
Elyashiḇ to the end of the house of Elyashiḇ. 
Nehem
3:22  And after him the priests, the men
of the neighbourhood, made repairs. 
Nehem
3:23  After him Binyamin and Ḥashshuḇ
made repairs opposite their house. After them Azaryah son of Ma‛asĕyah,
son of Ananyah, made repairs near his house. 
Nehem
3:24  After him Binnui son of Ḥĕnaḏaḏ
repaired another section, from the house of Azaryah to the angle, even as far
as the corner. 
Nehem
3:25  Palal son of Uzai made repairs opposite the corner, and on
the tower which projects from the sovereign’s upper house that was by the
courtyard of the prison. After him Peḏayah son of Parosh. 
Nehem
3:26  Now the Nethinim dwelt in Ophel as
far as opposite the Water Gate toward the east, and on the projecting tower. 
Nehem
3:27  After him the Teqowites repaired
another section, opposite the great projecting tower, and as far as the wall of
Ophel. 
Nehem
3:28  Beyond the Horse Gate the priests
made repairs, each opposite his own house. 
Nehem
3:29  After them Tsaḏoq son of Immĕr
made repairs opposite his own house. After him Shemayah son of Sheḵanyah,
keeper of the East Gate, made repairs. 
Nehem
3:30  After him Ḥananyah son of
Shelemyah, and Ḥanun, the sixth son of Tsalaph, repaired another section.
After him Meshullam son of Bereḵyah made repairs opposite his room. 
Nehem
3:31  After him Malkiyah, one of the
goldsmiths, made repairs as far as the house of the Nethinim and of the
merchants, opposite the Miphqaḏ Gate, and as far as the going up of the
corner. 
Nehem
3:32  And between the going up of the
corner to the Sheep Gate, the goldsmiths and the merchants made repairs. 
Nehem
4:1  And it came to be, when Sanballat
heard that we were rebuilding the wall, that he was wroth and highly offended,
and mocked the Yehuḏim. 
Nehem
4:2  And he spoke before his brothers and
the army of Shomeron, and said, “What are these feeble Yehuḏim doing? Are
they going to restore, slaughter, complete it in a day? Are they going to bring
to life the stones from the heaps of rubbish which are burned?” 
Nehem
4:3  And Toḇiyah the Ammonite was
beside him, and he said, “Whatever they build, if a fox should climb on it, he
shall break down their stone wall.” 
Nehem
4:4  “Hear, O our Elohim, for we have
become despised. And turn back their reproach on their own heads, and give them
as a prey in a land of captivity! 
Nehem
4:5  “And do not cover over their
crookedness, and do not let their sin be blotted out from before You, for they
have provoked You before the builders.” 
Nehem
4:6  So we built the wall, and the entire
wall was joined together up to the half of it, for the people had a heart to
work. 
Nehem
4:7  And it came to be, when Sanballat
and Toḇiyah, and the Araḇs, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdoḏites
heard that the walls of Yerushalayim were being repaired and the broken places
began to be filled, that they became very wroth, 
Nehem
4:8  and all of them conspired together
to come to fight against Yerushalayim and to do harm to it. 
Nehem
4:9  But we prayed to our Elohim, and set
a watch against them day and night, because of them. 
Nehem
4:10  And Yehuḏah said, “The
strength of the burden bearers is weakening, and there is so much rubbish that
we are unable to build the wall.” 
Nehem
4:11  And our adversaries said, “Let them
not know or see it until we come into their midst and shall slay them, and
cause the work to cease.” 
Nehem
4:12  And it came to be, when the Yehuḏim
who dwelt near them came, that they said to us ten times, “From whatever place
you turn, they are against us.” 
Nehem
4:13  So I set men behind the lower parts of the wall, at the openings – I set the
people according to their clans, with their swords, their spears, and their
bows. 
Nehem
4:14  And I looked, and rose up and said
to the nobles, and to the deputy rulers, and to the rest of the people, “Do not
be afraid of them. Remember the great and awesome, יהוה,
and fight for your brothers, your sons and your daughters, your wives and your
houses.” 
Nehem
4:15  And it came to be, when our enemies
heard that it was known to us, and that Elohim had brought their counsel to
naught, that all of us returned to the wall, everyone to his work. 
Nehem
4:16  And it came to be, from that time
on, that half of my servants were working in the work, while the other half
were holding the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the breastplates. And
the rulers were behind all the house of Yehuḏah, 
Nehem
4:17  who were building on the wall, and
those bearing burdens, those loading, working with one hand in the work, and
with the other holding a weapon. 
Nehem
4:18  As for the builders, each one had
his sword girded at his side as he built. And the one who sounded the ram’s
horn was beside me. 
Nehem
4:19  And I said to the nobles, and to
the deputy rulers, and to the rest of the people, “The work is great and large,
and we are separated far from one another on the wall. 
Nehem
4:20  “In whatever place you hear the
sound of the ram’s horn, join us there. Our Elohim fights for us.” 
Nehem
4:21  So we laboured in the work, and
half of them held the spears from the break of day until the stars appeared. 
Nehem
4:22  At that time I also said to the
people, “Let each man and his servant spend the night in Yerushalayim, and they
shall be our guard by night, and for the work by day.” 
Nehem
4:23  So neither I, nor my brothers, nor
my servants, nor the men of the guard who followed me, none of us took off our
garments, each one his weapon even at
the water. 
Nehem
5:1  And there was a great outcry of the
people and their wives against their brothers, the Yehuḏim. 
Nehem
5:2  And there were some who were saying,
“We, our sons, and our daughters are many. Let us get grain for them, and eat,
and live.” 
Nehem
5:3  And there were some who were saying,
“We have mortgaged our lands and vineyards and houses. Let us buy grain because
of the scarcity of food.” 
Nehem
5:4  And there were those who were
saying, “We have borrowed silver for the sovereign’s tax on our lands and
vineyards. 
Nehem
5:5  “And now our flesh is like the flesh
of our brothers, our children like their children. And see, we are subjecting
our sons and our daughters to be slaves, and some of our daughters have already been subjected, and there is no
power in our hands, for other men have our lands and vineyards.” 
Nehem
5:6  And it was very displeasing to me
when I heard their outcry and these words. 
Nehem
5:7  And my heart ruled over me, and I
strove with the nobles and with the deputy rulers, and said to them, “You are
exacting interest, each one from his brother.” And I called a great assembly
against them, 
Nehem
5:8  and said to them, “According to our
ability we have redeemed our brothers, the Yehuḏim, who were sold to the
gentiles. And you even sell your brothers! Or should they be sold to us?” And
they were silent and found not a word to
say. 
Nehem
5:9  I also said, “What you are doing is
not good. Should you not walk in the fear of our Elohim because of the reproach
of the gentiles, our enemies? 
Nehem
5:10  “And also, I, my brothers and my
servants, am lending them silver and grain. Please, let us leave off this
interest! 
Nehem
5:11  “Please, give back to them, even
today, their lands, their vineyards, their olive-trees, and their houses, also
the hundredth part of the silver and of the grain, and of the new wine, and of
the oil, that you have taken from them.” 
Nehem
5:12  And they said, “Let us give it
back, and ask no more from them, we do as you say.” Then I called the priests,
and made them swear to do according to this word. 
Nehem
5:13  I also shook out the fold of my
garment and said, “Let Elohim in this way shake out each man from his house,
and from his property, who does not do this word, even to be thus shaken out
and emptied.” And all the assembly said, “Amĕn!” and praised יהוה.
And the people did according to this word. 
Nehem
5:14  Also, from the day I was appointed
to be their governor in the land of Yehuḏah, from the twentieth year
until the thirty-second year of Sovereign Artaḥshashta, twelve years,
neither I nor my brothers ate the governor’s food. 
Nehem
5:15  But the former governors who were
before me laid burdens on the people, and took from them bread and wine,
besides forty sheqels of silver. Their servants also oppressed the people, but
I did not do so, because of the fear of Elohim. 
Nehem
5:16  And I also applied myself to the
work on this wall. We did not buy any land. And all my servants were gathered
there for the work. 
Nehem
5:17  And at my table were one hundred
and fifty of the Yehuḏim and deputy rulers, besides those who came to us
from the nations around us. 
Nehem
5:18  And that which was prepared for me
daily was one ox and six choice sheep, and birds were prepared for me, and once
every ten days plenty of all kinds of wine. And in spite of this I did not seek
the governor’s food, because the bondage was heavy on this people. 
Nehem
5:19  O my Elohim, remember me for the
good – all that I have done for this people. 
Nehem
6:1  And it came to be when Sanballat,
and Toḇiyah, and Geshem the Araḇ, and the rest of our enemies heard
that I had rebuilt the wall, and that there were no breaks left in it – though
at that time I had not set up the doors in the gates – 
Nehem
6:2  that Sanballat and Geshem sent to
me, saying, “Come, let us meet together in the villages in the plain of Ono.”
But they were planning to do evil to me. 
Nehem
6:3  So I sent messengers to them,
saying, “I am doing a great work, and I am unable to come down. Why should the
work cease while I leave it and come down to you?” 
Nehem
6:4  However, they sent me the same word
four times, and I answered them the same word. 
Nehem
6:5  Then Sanballat sent his servant to
me with an open letter in his hand, the same word, the fifth time. 
Nehem
6:6  In it was written: Among the nations
it has been heard, and Gashmu is saying, that you and the Yehuḏim are
planning to rebel, therefore you are rebuilding the wall, and you are to be
their sovereign – according to these words. 
Nehem
6:7  And you have also appointed prophets
to proclaim concerning you at Yerushalayim, saying, ‘A sovereign is in Yehuḏah!’
And now these words are heard by the sovereign. Therefore come now, and let us
take counsel together. 
Nehem
6:8  Then I sent to him, saying, “There
are no such matters done as you are saying, but you are inventing them in your
own heart.” 
Nehem
6:9  For all of them were making us
afraid, saying, “Let their hands slacken for the work, and it not be done.” But
now, make my hands strong. 
Nehem
6:10  And when I came to the house of
Shemayah son of Delayah, son of Mehĕtaḇ’ĕl, who was restrained,
he said, “Let us meet together in the House of Elohim, inside the Hĕḵal,
and let us close the doors of the Hĕḵal, for they are coming to slay
you – by night they are coming to slay you.” 
Nehem
6:11  And I said, “Should a man like me
flee? And who is there like me who would go into the Hĕḵal to save
his life? I do not go in!” 
Nehem
6:12  And see, I perceived that Elohim
had not sent him, but that he spoke this prophecy against me because Toḇiyah
and Sanballat had hired him – 
Nehem
6:13  because he was a hireling – that I
should be afraid, and do so, and shall sin, and so they could give me an evil
name, to reproach me. 
Nehem
6:14  My Elohim, remember Toḇiyah
and Sanballat, according to these works of theirs, and the prophetess No‛aḏyah
and the rest of the prophets who would have made me afraid. 
Nehem
6:15  And the wall was completed on the
twenty-fifth of the month of Elul, in
fifty-two days. 
Nehem
6:16  And it came to be, when all our
enemies heard, and all the nations around us saw, that they fell greatly in
their own eyes, and knew that this work was done by our Elohim. 
Nehem
6:17  In those days the nobles of Yehuḏah
also sent many letters to Toḇiyah, while those of Toḇiyah came to
them. 
Nehem
6:18  For many in Yehuḏah were
sworn to him, because he was the son-in-law of Sheḵanyah son of
Araḥ, and his son Yehoḥanan had married the daughter of Meshullam
son of Bereḵyah. 
Nehem
6:19  They were also speaking about his
good deeds before me, and reported my words to him. Toḇiyah sent letters
to frighten me. 
Nehem
7:1  And it came to be, when the wall was
rebuilt, that I set up the doors, and the gatekeepers, and the singers, and the
Lĕwites were appointed. 
Nehem
7:2  And I put my brother Ḥanani in
charge of Yerushalayim, and Ḥananyah the head of the palace, for he was a
trustworthy man and feared Elohim more than many. 
Nehem
7:3  And I said to them, “Let not the
gates of Yerushalayim be opened until the sun is hot. And while they are
standing by, let them shut the doors and bolt them. And appoint guards from
among the inhabitants of Yerushalayim, each at his post, and each in front of
his own house.” 
Nehem
7:4  And the city was wide on both sides
and great, but the people in it were few, and the houses were not rebuilt. 
Nehem
7:5  And my Elohim put it into my heart
to gather the nobles, and the deputy rulers, and the people, in order to be
registered by genealogy. And I found a register of the genealogy of those who
had come up at the beginning, and I found written in it: 
Nehem
7:6  These are the sons of the province
who came back from the captivity of the exiles whom Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar
the sovereign of Baḇel had exiled, and who returned to Yerushalayim and
Yehuḏah, each to his city, 
Nehem
7:7  who came with Zerubbaḇel, Yĕshua,
Neḥemyah, Azaryah, Ra‛amyah, Naḥamani, Mordeḵai,
Bilshan, Mispereth, Biḡwai, Neḥum, Ba‛anah. The number of the
men of the people of Yisra’ĕl: 
Nehem
7:8  sons of Parosh, two thousand one
hundred and seventy-two; 
Nehem
7:9  sons of Shephatyah, three hundred
and seventy-two; 
Nehem
7:10  sons of Araḥ, six hundred and
fifty-two;

eighteen;

two hundred and fifty-four;

7:19  sons of Biḡwai, two thousand

Nehem
7:20  sons of Aḏin, six hundred and
fifty-five;

7:21  sons of Atĕr of Ḥizqiyah,

7:23  sons of Bĕtsai, three hundred

Nehem
7:24  sons of Ḥariph, one hundred
and twelve; 
Nehem

Nehem
7:60  All the Nethinim, and the sons of
Shelomoh’s servants, were three hundred and ninety-two. 
Nehem
7:61  And these were the ones who came up
from Tĕl Melaḥ, Tĕl Ḥarsha, Keruḇ, Addon, and Immĕr,
but they were unable to show their father’s house, and their seed, whether they
were of Yisra’ĕl: 
Nehem
7:62  sons of Delayah, sons of Toḇiyah,
sons of Neqoḏa, six hundred and forty-two. 
Nehem
7:63  And of the priests: sons of Ḥaḇayah,

the Gil‛aḏite, and was called by their name. 
Nehem
7:64  These sought their register among those who were counted by genealogy,
but it was not found, so they were barred
from the priesthood as defiled. 
Nehem
7:65  And the governor said to them that
they should not eat of the most set-apart gifts until a priest stood up with
the Urim and Tummim. 
Nehem
7:66  All the assembly together was
forty-two thousand three hundred and sixty, 
Nehem
7:67  besides their male and female
servants, these were seven thousand three hundred and thirty-seven. And they
had two hundred and forty-five men and women singers. 
Nehem
7:68  Their horses were seven hundred and
thirty-six, their mules two hundred and forty-five, 
Nehem
7:69  camels four hundred and
thirty-five, donkeys six thousand seven hundred and twenty. 
Nehem
7:70  And some of the heads of the
fathers’ houses contributed to the
work. The governor gave to the treasury one thousand gold drachmas, fifty
basins, and five hundred and thirty priestly garments. 
Nehem
7:71  Some of the heads of the fathers’ houses gave to the treasury of the work
twenty thousand gold drachmas, and two thousand two hundred silver minas. 
Nehem
7:72  And the rest of the people gave
twenty thousand gold drachmas, two thousand silver minas, and sixty-seven
priestly garments. 
Nehem
7:73  So the priests, and the Lĕwites,
and the gatekeepers, and the singers, and some of the people, and the Nethinim,
and all Yisra’ĕl dwelt in their cities. 
Nehem
8:1  And when the seventh month came, the
children of Yisra’ĕl were in their cities. And all the people gathered
together as one man in the open space that was in front of the Water Gate. And
they spoke to Ezra the scribe to bring the Book of the Torah of Mosheh, which יהוה
had commanded Yisra’ĕl. 
Nehem
8:2  And Ezra the priest brought the
Torah before the assembly of both men and women and all who could hear with
understanding, on the first day of the seventh month. 
Nehem
8:3  And he read from it in the open
space in front of the Water Gate from morning until midday, before the men and
women and those who could understand. And the ears of all the people listened to the Book of the Torah. 
Nehem
8:4  And Ezra the scribe stood on a
platform of wood which they had made for the purpose. And beside him on his
right stood Mattithyah, and Shema, and Anayah, and Uriyah, and Ḥilqiyah,
and Ma‛asĕyah. And on his left stood
Peḏayah, and Misha’ĕl, and Malkiyah, and Ḥashum, and Ḥashbaddanah,
Zeḵaryah, Meshullam. 
Nehem
8:5  And Ezra opened the book in the
sight of all the people, for he was above all the people. And when he opened
it, all the people stood up. 
Nehem
8:6  And Ezra blessed יהוה,
the great Elohim. Then all the people answered, “Amĕn, Amĕn!” while
lifting up their hands. And they bowed their heads and worshipped יהוה
with faces to the ground. 
Nehem
8:7  And Yĕshua, and Bani, and Shĕrĕḇyah,
Yamin, Aqquḇ, Shabbethai, Hoḏiyah, Ma‛asĕyah, Qelita,
Azaryah, Yozaḇaḏ, Ḥanan, Pelayah, and the Lĕwites,
caused the people to understand the Torah while the people were in their place.

Nehem
8:8  And they read in the Book of the
Torah of Elohim, translating to give the sense, and caused them to understand the reading. 
Nehem
8:9  And Neḥemyah, who was the
governor, and Ezra the priest, the scribe, and the Lĕwites who taught the
people said to all the people, “This day is set-apart to יהוה
your Elohim. Do not mourn or weep.” For all the people wept when they heard the
words of the Torah. 
Nehem
8:10  Then he said to them, “Go, eat the
fat, drink the sweet, and send portions to those for whom none is prepared. For
this day is set-apart to our יהוה. Do not be sad, for
the joy of יהוה is your strength.” 
Nehem
8:11  And the Lĕwites were silencing
all the people, saying, “Hush, for the day is set-apart, do not be sad.” 
Nehem
8:12  And all the people went to eat and
to drink, and to send portions and make a great rejoicing, because they
understood the words that were made known to them. 
Nehem
8:13  And on the second day the heads of
the fathers’ houses of all the
people, with the priests and Lĕwites, were gathered to Ezra the scribe, in
order to study the words of the Torah. 
Nehem
8:14  And they found written in the
Torah, which יהוה had commanded by Mosheh, that the
children of Yisra’ĕl should dwell in booths in the festival of the seventh
month, 
Nehem
8:15  and that they should announce and
proclaim in all their cities and in Yerushalayim, saying, “Go out to the
mountain, and bring olive branches, branches of oil trees, and myrtle branches,
and palm branches, and branches of leafy trees, to make booths, as it is
written.” 
Nehem
8:16  So the people went out and brought
them and made themselves booths, each one on the roof of his house, and in
their courtyards and in the courtyards of the House of Elohim, and in the open
space of the Water Gate and in the open space of the Gate of Ephrayim. 
Nehem
8:17  And the entire assembly of those
who had come back from the captivity made booths and sat under the booths, for
since the days of Yeshua son of Nun until that day the children of Yisra’ĕl
had not done so. And there was very great rejoicing. 
Nehem
8:18  And day by day, from the first day
until the last day, he read from the Book of the Torah of Elohim. And they
performed the festival seven days. And on the eighth day there was an assembly,
according to the right-ruling. 
Nehem
9:1  And on the twenty-fourth day of this
month the children of Yisra’ĕl were assembled with fasting, and in
sackcloth, and with earth on them. 
Nehem
9:2  And the descendants of Yisra’ĕl
separated themselves from all foreigners, and stood and confessed their sins,
and the crookednesses of their fathers, 
Nehem
9:3  and they stood up in their place and
read from the Book of the Torah of יהוה their Elohim a
fourth part of the day, and a fourth part they were confessing and worshipping יהוה
their Elohim. 
Nehem
9:4  Then Yĕshua and Bani, Qaḏmi’ĕl,
Sheḇanyah, Bunni, Shĕrĕḇyah, Bani, Kenani stood on the
stairs of the Lĕwites and cried out with a loud voice to יהוה
their Elohim. 
Nehem
9:5  Then the Lĕwites, Yĕshua
and Qaḏmi’ĕl, Bani, Ḥashaḇneyah, Shĕrĕḇyah,
Hoḏiyah, Sheḇanyah, Pethaḥyah, said, “Rise, bless יהוה
your Elohim forever and ever! And let them bless Your esteemed Name, which is
exalted above all blessing and praise! 
Nehem
9:6  “You are יהוה,
You alone. You have made the heavens, the heavens of the heavens, with all
their host, the earth and all that are on it, the seas and all that are in
them, and You give life to them all. And the host of the heavens are bowing
themselves to You. 
Nehem
9:7  “You are יהוה,
the Elohim who chose Aḇram, and brought him out of Ur of the Chaldees,
and gave him the name of Aḇraham, 
Nehem
9:8  and found his heart trustworthy
before You, and made a covenant with him to give the land of the Kena‛anites,
the Ḥittites, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Yeḇusites,
and the Girgashites – to give it to his seed. And You have established Your
words, for You are righteous, 
Nehem
9:9  and saw the affliction of our
fathers in Mitsrayim, and heard their cry by the Sea of Reeds, 
Nehem
9:10  and gave signs and wonders against
Pharaoh, and against all his servants, and against all the people of his land.
For You knew that they acted proudly against them. And You made a Name for
Yourself, as it is this day. 
Nehem
9:11  “And You split the sea before them,
and they passed over into the midst of the sea on the dry land. And their
pursuers You threw into the deep as a stone into the mighty waters. 
Nehem
9:12  “And You led them by day with a
cloudy column, and by night with a column of fire, to give them light in the
way they were to go. 
Nehem
9:13  “And You came down on Mount Sinai,
and spoke with them from the heavens, and gave them straight right-rulings and
Torah of truth, good laws and commands.
Nehem
9:14  “And You made known to them Your
set-apart Sabbath, and You commanded them commands and laws and Torot , by the
hand of Mosheh Your servant.
Nehem
9:15  “And You gave them bread from the
heavens for their hunger, and brought them water out of the rock for their
thirst, and said to them to go in to possess the land which You had sworn to give
them. 
Nehem
9:16  “But they and our fathers acted
proudly, and hardened their necks, and did not obey Your commands. 
Nehem
9:17  “And they refused to obey, and they
remembered not Your wonders that You did among them, and hardened their necks,
and in their rebellion they appointed a leader to return to their bondage. But
You are a forgiving Eloah, showing favour, and compassionate, patient, and of
great kindness, and did not forsake them. 
Nehem
9:18  “Even when they made a moulded calf
for themselves, and said, ‘This is your mighty one that brought you up out of
Mitsrayim,’ and worked great blasphemies, 
Nehem
9:19  yet You, in Your great compassion
did not forsake them in the wilderness. The column of the cloud did not turn
away from them by day to lead them on the way, nor the column of fire by night
to give them light in the way they were to go. 
Nehem
9:20  “You also gave Your good Spirit to
instruct them, and did not withhold Your manna from their mouth, and gave them
water for their thirst.
Nehem
9:21  “And for forty years You sustained
them in the wilderness – they lacked not. Their garments did not wear out and
their feet did not swell. 
Nehem
9:22  “And You gave them reigns and
peoples, and apportioned them their lot. So they took possession of the land of
Siḥon, and the land of the sovereign of Ḥeshbon, and the land of Oḡ
sovereign of Bashan. 
Nehem
9:23  “And You increased their children
as the stars of the heavens, and brought them into the land which You had said
to their fathers to go in and possess. 
Nehem
9:24  “So the sons went in and possessed
the land, and You humbled before them the people of the land, the Kena‛anites,
and gave them into their hands, with their sovereigns and the people of the
land, to do with them as they desired. 
Nehem
9:25  “And they captured walled cities
and a rich land, and possessed houses filled with all good, cisterns already
dug, vineyards, and olive-trees, and fruit trees, in plenty. So they ate and
were satisfied and grew fat, and delighted themselves in Your great goodness. 
Nehem
9:26  “But they became disobedient and
rebelled against You, and cast Your Torah behind their backs. And they slew
Your prophets who had warned them, to bring them back to Yourself. And they
worked great blasphemies. 
Nehem
9:27  “Therefore You gave them into the
hand of their enemies, who distressed them. And in the time of their distress,
when they cried to You, You heard from the heavens. And according to Your great
compassion You gave them saviours who saved them from the hand of their
enemies. 
Nehem
9:28  “But after they had rest, they
turned back to do evil before You. Then You left them in the hand of their
enemies, so that they ruled over them. But when they turned back and cried out
to You, You heard from the heavens, and delivered them according to Your
compassion, many times, 
Nehem
9:29  and warned them, to bring them back
to Your Torah. But they acted proudly, and did not obey Your commands, and
sinned against Your right-rulings, ‘which if a man does, he shall live by them.’
And they gave the rebellious shoulder and hardened their necks, and would not
hear.
Nehem
9:30  “And You had patience with them for
many years, and did warn them by Your Spirit, by the hand of Your prophets, yet
they would not give ear. Therefore You gave them into the hand of the peoples
of the lands. 
Nehem
9:31  “But in Your great compassion You
did not make an end of them nor forsake them, for You are an Ĕl of favour
and compassion. 
Nehem
9:32  “And now, our Elohim, the great,
the mighty, and awesome Ĕl, guarding the covenant and the kindness, let
not all the trouble that has come upon us, our sovereigns and our heads, our
priests and our prophets, our fathers and on all Your people, from the days of
the sovereigns of Ashshur until this day, seem little before You. 
Nehem
9:33  “And in all that has come upon us
You are righteous, for You have done truth, but we have done wrong. 
Nehem
9:34  “And our sovereigns, our rulers,
our priests, and our fathers, have not done Your Torah, nor heeded Your commands
and Your witnesses, with which You witnessed against them. 
Nehem
9:35  “For they have not served You in
their reign, or in Your great goodness that You gave them, or in the large and
rich land which You set before them – neither turned back from their evil
deeds. 
Nehem
9:36  “See, we are servants today! And
the land that You gave to our fathers, to eat its fruit and the good of it,
see, we are servants in it! 
Nehem
9:37  “And its rich yield goes to the
sovereigns You have set over us, because of our sins. And they rule over our
bodies and our livestock at their pleasure, and we are in great distress. 
Nehem
9:38  “And because of all this, we are
making a trustworthy pledge, and write it. And our rulers, our Lĕwites,
our priests set their seal on it.” 
Nehem
10:1  And those who set their seal were:
Neḥemyah the governor, son of Ḥaḵalyah, and Tsiḏqiyah, 
Nehem
10:2  Serayah, Azaryah, Yirmeyah, 
Nehem
10:3  Pashhur, Amaryah, Malkiyah,

Nehem
10:7  Meshullam, Aḇiyah, Miyamin, 
Nehem
10:8  Ma‛azyah, Bilgai, and
Shemayah. These were the priests. 
Nehem
10:9  And the Lĕwites: both Yĕshua
son of Atsanyah, Binnui of the sons of Ḥĕnaḏaḏ, Qaḏmi’ĕl.

Nehem
10:10  And their brothers: Sheḇanyah,
Hoḏiyah, Qelita, Pelayah, Ḥanan, 
Nehem
10:11  Miḵa, Reḥoḇ, Ḥashaḇyah,

Nehem
10:12  Zakkur, Shĕrĕḇyah,
Sheḇanyah, 
Nehem
10:13  Hoḏiyah, Bani, and Beninu. 
Nehem
10:14  The leaders of the people: Parosh,
Paḥath-Mo’aḇ, Ĕylam, Zattu, Bani, 
Nehem
10:15  Bunni, Azgaḏ, Bĕḇai,

Nehem
10:16  Aḏoniyah, Biḡwai, Aḏin,

Nehem
10:26  Aḥiyah, Ḥanan, Anan, 
Nehem
10:27  Malluḵ, Ḥarim, Ba‛anah.

Nehem
10:28  And the rest of the people, the
priests, the Lĕwites, the gatekeepers, the singers, the Nethinim, and all
those who had separated themselves from the peoples of the lands unto the Torah
of Elohim, their wives, their sons, and their daughters, all who had knowledge
and understanding, 
Nehem
10:29  were joining with their brothers,
their nobles, and were entering into a curse and into an oath to walk in the
Torah of Elohim, which was given by Mosheh the servant of Elohim, and to guard
and do all the commands of יהוה our Master, and His
right-rulings and His laws, 
Nehem
10:30  and that we would not give our
daughters as wives to the peoples of the land, nor take their daughters for our
sons, 
Nehem
10:31  and that if the peoples of the
land bring wares or any grain to sell on the Sabbath day, we would not buy it
from them on the Sabbath, or on a set-apart day, and we would forego the
seventh year and the interest of every hand. 
Nehem
10:32  And we imposed commands on
ourselves, to give from ourselves yearly one-third of a sheqel for the service
of the House of our Elohim: 
Nehem
10:33  for the showbread, and for the
continual grain offering, and for the continual burnt offering of the Sabbaths,
of the New Moons, for the appointed times, and for the set-apart offerings, and
for the sin offerings to make atonement for Yisra’ĕl, and all the work of
the House of our Elohim. 
Nehem
10:34  And we cast lots among the
priests, and the Lĕwites, and the people, for bringing the wood offering
into the House of our Elohim, according to our fathers’ houses, at the
appointed times year by year, to burn on the altar of יהוה
our Elohim as it is written in the Torah, 
Nehem
10:35  and to bring the first-fruits of
our soil and the first-fruits of all fruit of all trees, year by year, to the
House of יהוה, 
Nehem
10:36  also to bring the first-born of
our sons and our livestock, as it is written in the Torah, and the firstlings
of our herds and our flocks, to the House of our Elohim, to the priests
attending in the House of our Elohim. 
Nehem
10:37  And that we should bring the
first-fruits of our dough, and our contributions, and the fruit from all kinds
of trees, of new wine and of oil, to the priests, to the storerooms of the
House of our Elohim; and the tithes of our land to the Lĕwites, for the Lĕwites
should receive the tithes in all our rural towns. 
Nehem
10:38  And the priest, son of Aharon,
shall be with the Lĕwites when the Lĕwites receive tithes, and the Lĕwites
bring up a tenth of the tithes to the House of our Elohim, to the rooms of the
storehouse. 
Nehem
10:39  For the children of Yisra’ĕl
and the children of Lĕwi bring the offering of the grain, of the new wine
and the oil, to the storerooms where the vessels of the set-apart place are,
where the priests who attend and the gatekeepers and the singers are, and we
should not neglect the House of our Elohim. 
Nehem
11:1  Now the rulers of the people dwelt
at Yerushalayim, and the rest of the people cast lots to bring one out of ten
to dwell in Yerushalayim, the set-apart city, and nine-tenths were to dwell in
other cities. 
Nehem
11:2  And the people blessed all the men
who volunteered to dwell at Yerushalayim. 
Nehem
11:3  And these are the heads of the
province who dwelt in Yerushalayim, but in the cities of Yehuḏah everyone
dwelt in his own possession in their cities – Yisra’ĕl, the priests, and
the Lĕwites, and the Nethinim, and the sons of Shelomoh’s servants. 
Nehem
11:4  And in Yerushalayim dwelt certain
of the children of Yehuḏah and of the children of Binyamin. Of the
children of Yehuḏah: Athayah son of Uzziyah, son of Zeḵaryah, son
of Amaryah, son of Shephatyah, son of Mahalal’ĕl, of the children of
Perets;

11:5  and Ma‛asĕyah son of
Baruḵ, son of Kol-Ḥozeh, son of Ḥazayah, son of Aḏayah,

Nehem
11:6  All the sons of Perets who dwelt at
Yerushalayim were four hundred and sixty-eight brave men. 
Nehem
11:7  And these are the sons of Binyamin:
Sallu son of Meshullam, son of Yow‛ĕḏ, son of Peḏayah,
son of Qolayah, son of Ma‛asĕyah, son of Ithi’ĕl, son of
Yeshayah;

11:8  and after him Gabbai, Sallai, nine
hundred and twenty-eight. 
Nehem
11:9  And Yo’ĕl son of Ziḵri
was their overseer, and Yehuḏah son of Senuah was second over the city. 
Nehem
11:10  Of the priests: Yeḏayah son
of Yoyariḇ, Yaḵin, 
Nehem
11:11  Serayah son of Ḥilqiyah, son
of Meshullam, son of Tsaḏoq, son of Merayoth, son of Aḥituḇ,
was the leader of the House of Elohim. 
Nehem
11:12  And their brothers who did the
work of the House were eight hundred and twenty-two; and Aḏayah son of
Yeroḥam, son of Pelalyah, son of Amtsi, son of Zeḵaryah, son of
Pashhur, son of Malkiyah,

11:13  and his brothers, heads of the
fathers’ houses, were two hundred and
forty-two; and Amashai son of Azar’ĕl, son of Aḥzai, son of Meshillĕmoth,
son of Immĕr, 
Nehem
11:14  and their brothers, mighty brave
ones, were one hundred and twenty-eight. And their overseer was Zaḇdi’ĕl,
son of the great ones. 
Nehem
11:15  Also of the Lĕwites: Shemayah
son of Ḥashshuḇ, son of Azriqam, son of Ḥashaḇyah, son
of Bunni; 
Nehem
11:16  and Shabbethai and Yozaḇaḏ,
of the heads of the Lĕwites, over the outside work of the House of Elohim;

Nehem
11:17  and Mattanyah son of Miḵa,
son of Zaḇdi, son of Asaph, who was the leader who began the thanksgiving
with prayer, and Baqbuqyah the second among his brothers, and Aḇda son of
Shammua, son of Galal, son of Yeḏuthun. 
Nehem
11:18  All the Lĕwites in the
set-apart city were two hundred and eighty-four. 
Nehem
11:19  And the gatekeepers, Aqquḇ,
Talmon, and their brothers keeping guard at the gates, were one hundred and
seventy-two. 
Nehem
11:20  And the rest of Yisra’ĕl, of
the priests, Lĕwites, were in all the cities of Yehuḏah, each one in
his inheritance. 
Nehem
11:21  But the Nethinim dwelt in Ophel.
And Tsiḥa and Gishpa were over the Nethinim. 
Nehem
11:22  And the overseer of the Lĕwites
at Yerushalayim was Uzzi son of Bani, son of Ḥashaḇyah, son of
Mattanyah, son of Miḵa. Of the sons of Asaph, the singers were over the
work of the House of Elohim, 
Nehem
11:23  for the sovereign’s command was
upon them – and support for the singers, a matter day by day. 
Nehem
11:24  And Pethaḥyah son of Meshĕyzaḇ’ĕl,
of the children of Zeraḥ son of Yehuḏah, was the sovereign’s deputy
in all matters concerning the people. 
Nehem
11:25  And at the villages with their
fields, some of the children of Yehuḏah dwelt in Qiryath Arba and its
villages, and in Diḇon and its villages, and in Yeqaḇtse’ĕl
and its villages, 
Nehem
11:26  and in Yĕshua, and in Molaḏah,
and in Bĕyth Pelet, 
Nehem
11:27  and in Ḥatsar Shu‛al,
and in Be’ĕrsheḇa and its villages, 
Nehem
11:28  and in Tsiqlaḡ, and in Meḵonah
and its villages, 
Nehem
11:29  and in Ĕn Rimmon, and in
Tsorah, and in Yarmuth, 
Nehem
11:30  Zanowaḥ, Aḏullam, and
their villages; in Laḵish and its fields; in Azĕqah and its
villages. So they dwelt from Be’ĕrsheḇa to the Valley of Hinnom. 
Nehem
11:31  And the children of Binyamin: from
Geḇa, Miḵmash, and Ayyah, and Bĕyth Ĕl, and their
villages; 
Nehem
11:32  Anathoth, Noḇ, Ananyah; 
Nehem
11:33  Ḥatsor, Ramah, Gittayim; 
Nehem
11:34  Ḥaḏiḏ, Tseḇo‛im,
Neḇallat; 
Nehem
11:35  Loḏ, and Ono, and the Valley
of Craftsmen. 
Nehem
11:36  And of the Lĕwites, the
divisions of Yehuḏah were for Binyamin. 
Nehem
12:1  And these were the priests and the
Lĕwites who came up with Zerubbaḇel son of She’alti’ĕl, and Yĕshua:
Serayah, Yirmeyah, Ezra, 
Nehem
12:2  Amaryah, Malluḵ, Ḥattush,

Nehem
12:3  Sheḵanyah, Reḥum, Merĕmoth,

Nehem
12:4  Iddo, Ginnethoi, Aḇiyah, 
Nehem
12:5  Miyamin, Ma‛aḏyah,
Bilgah, 
Nehem
12:6  Shemayah, and Yoyariḇ, Yeḏayah,

Nehem
12:7  Sallu, Amoq, Ḥilqiyah, and Yeḏayah.
These were the heads of the priests and their brothers in the days of Yĕshua.

Nehem
12:8  And the Lĕwites: Yĕshua,
Binnui, Qaḏmi’ĕl, Shĕrĕḇyah, Yehuḏah,
Mattanyah over the thanksgiving, he and his brothers. 
Nehem
12:9  And Baqbuqyah and Unni, their
brothers, were opposite them for guard duties. 
Nehem
12:10  And Yĕshua brought forth
Yoyaqim, and Yoyaqim brought forth Elyashiḇ, and Elyashiḇ brought
forth Yoyaḏa, 
Nehem
12:11  and Yoyaḏa brought forth
Yonathan, and Yonathan brought forth Yaddua. 
Nehem
12:12  And in the days of Yoyaqim, the
priests, the heads of the fathers’ houses
were: of Serayah, Merayah; of Yirmeyah, Ḥananyah; 
Nehem
12:13  of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amaryah,
Yehoḥanan; 
Nehem
12:14  of Meliḵu, Yonathan; of Sheḇanyah,
Yosĕph; 
Nehem
12:15  of Ḥarim, Aḏna; of
Merayoth, Ḥelqai; 
Nehem
12:16  of Iddo, Zeḵaryah; of
Ginnethon, Meshullam; 
Nehem
12:17  of Aḇiyah, Ziḵri, son of Minyamin; of Mo‛aḏyah,
Piltai; 
Nehem
12:18  of Bilgah, Shammua; of Shemayah,
Yehonathan; 
Nehem
12:19  of Yoyariḇ, Mattenai; of Yeḏayah,
Uzzi; 
Nehem
12:20  of Sallai, Qallai; of Amoq, Ĕḇer;

Nehem
12:21  of Ḥilqiyah, Ḥashaḇyah.
And of Yeḏayah, Nethanĕ’l. 
Nehem
12:22  The Lĕwites and priests in
the days of Elyashiḇ, Yoyaḏa, Yoḥanan, and Yaddua, were
recorded heads of their fathers’ houses,
also the priests in the reign of Dareyawesh the Persian. 
Nehem
12:23  The sons of Lĕwi, the heads
of the fathers’ houses until the days
of Yoḥanan son of Elyashiḇ, were written in the book of the annals.

Nehem
12:24  And the heads of the Lĕwites
were Ḥashaḇyah, Shĕrĕḇyah, and Yĕshua son of
Qaḏmi’ĕl, with their brothers opposite them, to praise, to give
thanks, watch opposite watch, according to the command of Dawiḏ the man
of Elohim. 
Nehem
12:25  Mattanyah, and Baqbuqyah, Oḇaḏyah,
Meshullam, Talmon, Aqquḇ were gatekeepers guarding at the storerooms of
the gates. 
Nehem
12:26  These were in the days of Yoyaqim
son of Yĕshua, son of Yotsaḏaq, and in the days of Neḥemyah
the governor, and of Ezra the priest, the scribe. 
Nehem
12:27  And at the dedication of the wall
of Yerushalayim they sought out the Lĕwites in all their places, to bring
them to Yerushalayim to perform the dedication with gladness, and with
thanksgivings, and with singing, cymbals, harps and lyres. 
Nehem
12:28  And the sons of the singers
gathered together from the countryside around Yerushalayim, from the villages
of the Netophathites, 
Nehem
12:29  and from the house of Gilgal, and
from the fields of Geḇa and Azmaweth – for the singers had built
themselves villages all around Yerushalayim. 
Nehem
12:30  And the priests and Lĕwites
cleansed themselves, and they cleansed the people, and the gates, and the wall.

Nehem
12:31  And I brought the rulers of Yehuḏah
up on the wall, and appointed two large thanksgiving choirs, to go to the right
on the wall toward the Dung Gate, 
Nehem
12:32  and after them went Hoshayah and
half of the rulers of Yehuḏah, 
Nehem
12:33  then Azaryah, Ezra, and Meshullam,

Nehem
12:34  Yehuḏah, and Binyamin, and
Shemayah, and Yirmeyah, 
Nehem
12:35  and of the sons of the priests
with trumpets: Zeḵaryah son of Yonathan, son of Shemayah, son of
Mattanyah, son of Miḵayah, son of Zakkur, son of Asaph, 
Nehem
12:36  and his brothers Shemayah and Azar’ĕl,
Milalai, Gilalai, Ma‛ai, Nethanĕ’l, and Yehuḏah, Ḥanani
with instruments of songs of Dawiḏ the man of Elohim, with Ezra the
scribe before them. 
Nehem
12:37  And at the Fountain Gate and
straight ahead of them, they went up the stairs of the City of Dawiḏ, on
the stairway of the wall, beyond the house of Dawiḏ, as far as the Water
Gate eastward. 
Nehem
12:38  And the other thanksgiving choir
went over against them, and I behind them with half of the people on the wall,
going past the Tower of the Ovens as far as the Broad Wall, 
Nehem
12:39  and above the Gate of Ephrayim,
and above the Old Gate, and above the Fish Gate, and the Tower of Ḥanan’ĕl,
and the Tower of the Hundred, as far as the Sheep Gate. And they stood still at
the Gate of the Prison. 
Nehem
12:40  Then the two thanksgiving choirs
took their stand in the House of Elohim, and I and half of the deputy rulers
with me, 
Nehem
12:41  and the priests, Elyaqim, Ma‛asĕyah,
Minyamin, Miḵayah, Elyo‛ĕynai, Zeḵaryah, and Ḥananyah,
with trumpets, 
Nehem
12:42  and Ma‛asĕyah, and
Shemayah, and El‛azar, and Uzzi, and Yehoḥanan, and Malkiyah, and Ĕylam,
and Ĕzer. And the singers sang aloud, with Yizraḥyah in charge. 
Nehem
12:43  And on that day they brought great
offerings and rejoiced, for Elohim had made them rejoice with great joy. And
the women and the children also rejoiced, so that the joy of Yerushalayim was
heard far away. 
Nehem
12:44  And on that day some were
appointed over the rooms for the stores, for the contributions, for the
first-fruits, and for tithes, to gather into them from the fields of the cities
the portions required by the Torah for the priests and for the Lĕwites.
For Yehuḏah rejoiced over the priests and the Lĕwites who stood up. 
Nehem
12:45  Both the singers and the
gatekeepers guarded the charge of their Elohim and the charge of the cleansing,
according to the command of Dawiḏ and Shelomoh his son. 
Nehem
12:46  For in the days of Dawiḏ and
Asaph of old there were chiefs of the singers, and songs of praise and
thanksgiving to Elohim. 
Nehem
12:47  And in the days of Zerubbaḇel
and in the days of Neḥemyah all Yisra’ĕl gave the portions for the
singers and the gatekeepers, a portion for each day. And they set apart what
was for the Lĕwites, and the Lĕwites set apart what was for the
children of Aharon. 
Nehem
13:1  On that day was read from the Book
of Mosheh in the hearing of the people, and in it was found written that an
Ammonite and Mo’aḇite should not come into the assembly of Elohim
forever, 
Nehem
13:2  because they had not met the
children of Yisra’ĕl with bread and water, and hired Bil‛am against
them to curse them, although our Elohim turned the curse into a blessing. 
Nehem
13:3  And it came to be, when they had
heard the Torah, that they separated all the mixed multitude from Yisra’ĕl.

Nehem
13:4  And before this, Elyashiḇ the
priest, having authority over the storerooms of the House of our Elohim, was a
relative of Toḇiyah, 
Nehem
13:5  and he had prepared for him a large
room, where previously they had stored the grain offerings, the frankincense,
and the utensils, and the tithes of grain, the new wine and the oil, which were
commanded to be given to the Lĕwites
and the singers and the gatekeepers, and the contributions for the priests. 
Nehem
13:6  But in all this I was not in
Yerushalayim, for in the thirty-second year of Artaḥshashta sovereign of
Baḇel I came to the sovereign. And after some days I asked leave from the
sovereign to return, 
Nehem
13:7  and I came to Yerushalayim and
learned of the evil which Elyashiḇ had done for Toḇiyah, in
preparing a room for him in the courts of the House of Elohim. 
Nehem
13:8  And it was very displeasing to me.
Therefore I threw all the household goods of Toḇiyah out of the room, 
Nehem
13:9  and I commanded them to cleanse the
rooms. And I put back into them the utensils of the House of Elohim, with the
grain offering and the frankincense. 
Nehem
13:10  And I learned that the portions
for the Lĕwites had not been given them, for each of the Lĕwites and
the singers who did the work had gone back to his field. 
Nehem
13:11  Then I contended with the deputy
rulers, and said, “Why is the House of Elohim forsaken?” And I gathered them
together and set them in their place. 
Nehem
13:12  And all Yehuḏah brought the
tithe of the grain and the new wine and the oil to the storehouse. 
Nehem
13:13  And I appointed as treasurers over
the storehouse Shelemyah the priest and Tsaḏoq the scribe, and Peḏayah
of the Lĕwites. And next to them was Ḥanan son of Zakkur, son of
Mattanyah. For they were reckoned trustworthy, and it was on them to distribute
to their brothers. 
Nehem
13:14  Remember me, O my Elohim,
concerning this, and do not wipe out my kind deeds that I have done for the
House of my Elohim, and for its charges! 
Nehem
13:15  In those days I saw in Yehuḏah
those treading wine presses on the Sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and
loading donkeys with wine, grapes, and figs, and all kinds of burdens, which
they brought into Yerushalayim on the Sabbath day. So I warned them on the day they sold food. 
Nehem
13:16  And men of Tsor dwelt there,
bringing in fish and all kinds of goods, and sold them on the Sabbath to the
children of Yehuḏah, and in Yerushalayim. 
Nehem
13:17  Then I contended with the nobles
of Yehuḏah, and said to them, “What evil matter is this that you are
doing, profaning the Sabbath day? 
Nehem
13:18  “Did not your fathers do the same
so that our Elohim brought all this evil on us and on this city? Yet you bring
added wrath on Yisra’ĕl by profaning the Sabbath.” 
Nehem
13:19  And it came to be, at the gates of
Yerushalayim, as it began to be dark before the Sabbath, that I commanded the
gates to be shut, and commanded that they should not be opened till after the
Sabbath. And I stationed some of my servants at the gates, so that no burdens
would be brought in on the Sabbath day. 
Nehem
13:20  And the merchants and sellers of
all kinds of wares spent the night outside Yerushalayim once or twice, 
Nehem
13:21  and I warned them, and said to
them, “Why do you spend the night around the wall? If you do so again, I lay
hands on you!” From that time on they came no more on the Sabbath. 
Nehem
13:22  And I commanded the Lĕwites
that they should cleanse themselves, and they should come, guarding the gates,
to set apart the Sabbath day. Remember me, O my Elohim, concerning this also,
and pardon me according to the greatness of Your kindness! 
Nehem
13:23  In those days I also saw Yehuḏim
who had married women of Ashdoḏ, Ammon, Mo’aḇ. 
Nehem
13:24  And half of their children spoke
the language of Ashdoḏ, and could not speak the language of Yehuḏah,
but spoke according to the language of one or the other people. 
Nehem
13:25  Then I contended with them and
cursed them, and smote some of them and pulled out their hair, and made them
swear by Elohim, saying, “You do not give your daughters as wives to their
sons, nor take their daughters for your sons or yourselves. 
Nehem
13:26  “Did not Shelomoh sovereign of
Yisra’ĕl sin because of them? Among the many nations there was no
sovereign like him, who was beloved of his Elohim, and Elohim made him
sovereign over all Yisra’ĕl. Even him foreign women caused to sin. 
Nehem
13:27  “Should we then hear of your doing
all this great evil, trespassing against our Elohim by marrying foreign wives?”

Nehem
13:28  And one of the sons of Yoyaḏa,
son of Elyashiḇ the high priest, was a son-in-law of Sanballat the Ḥoronite.
And I drove him from me. 
Nehem
13:29  Remember them, O my Elohim,
because they have defiled the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood,
and of the Lĕwites. 
Nehem
13:30  Thus I cleansed them from all that
is foreign. And I appointed duties to the priests and the Lĕwites, each in
his task, 
Nehem
13:31  and for the wood offering and the
first-fruits at appointed times. Remember me, O my Elohim, for good!
