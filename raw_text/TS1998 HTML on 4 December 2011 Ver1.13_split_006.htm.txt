the land of Mitsrayim. 
Exod

your land, and shall gather its increase, 
Exod
23:11  but the seventh year you are to
let it rest, and shall leave it, and the poor of your people shall eat. And

first-fruits of your land into the House of יהוה your
Elohim. Do not cook a young goat in its mother’s milk.

23:20  “See, I am sending a Messenger
before you to guard you in the way and to bring you into the place which I have
prepared. 
Exod

His voice. Do not rebel against Him, for He is not going to pardon your
transgression, for My Name is in Him. 
Exod
23:22  “But if you diligently obey His
voice and shall do all that I speak, then I shall be an enemy to your enemies

Exod
23:23  “For My Messenger shall go before
you and shall bring you in to the Amorites and the Ḥittites and the
Perizzites and the Kena‛anites and the Ḥiwwites and the Yeḇusites,

becomes a snare to you.” 
Exod
24:1  And to Mosheh He said, “Come up to יהוה,
you and Aharon, Naḏaḇ and Aḇihu, and seventy of the elders of
Yisra’ĕl, and you shall bow yourselves from a distance. 
Exod
24:2  “But Mosheh shall draw near to יהוה
by himself, and let them not draw near, nor let the people go up with him.” 
Exod
24:3  And Mosheh came and related to the
people all the Words of יהוה and all the right-rulings.
And all the people answered with one voice and said, “All the Words which יהוה
has spoken we shall do.” 
Exod
24:4  And Mosheh wrote down all the Words
of יהוה, and rose up early in the morning, and built an
altar at the foot of the mountain, and twelve standing columns for the twelve
tribes of Yisra’ĕl. 
Exod
24:5  And he sent young men of the
children of Yisra’ĕl, and they offered burnt offerings and slaughtered
peace slaughterings of bulls to יהוה. 
Exod
24:6  And Mosheh took half the blood and
put it in basins, and half the blood he sprinkled on the altar. 
Exod
24:7  And he took the Book of the
Covenant and read in the hearing of the people. And they said, “All that יהוה
has spoken we shall do, and obey.” 
Exod
24:8  And Mosheh took the blood and
sprinkled it on the people, and said, “See, the blood of the covenant which יהוה
has made with you concerning all these Words.” 
Exod
24:9  And Mosheh went up, also Aharon, Naḏaḇ,
and Aḇihu, and seventy of the elders of Yisra’ĕl, 
Exod
24:10  and they saw the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl,
and under His feet like a paved work of sapphire stone, and like the heavens
for brightness. 
Exod
24:11  Yet He did not stretch out His
hand against the chiefs of the children of Yisra’ĕl! And they saw Elohim,
and they ate and drank. 
Exod
24:12  And יהוה
said to Mosheh, “Come up to Me on the mountain and be there, while I give you
tablets of stone, and the Torah and the command which I have written, to teach
them.” 
Exod
24:13  And Mosheh arose with his assistant
Yehoshua, and Mosheh went up to the mountain of Elohim. 
Exod
24:14  And he said to the elders, “Wait
here for us until we come back to you. And see, Aharon and Ḥur are with
you. Whoever has matters, let him go to them.” 
Exod
24:15  And Mosheh went up into the
mountain, and a cloud covered the mountain. 
Exod
24:16  And the esteem of יהוה
dwelt on Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it for six days. And on the seventh
day He called to Mosheh out of the midst of the cloud. 
Exod
24:17  And the appearance of the esteem
of יהוה was like a consuming fire on the top of the
mountain, before the eyes of the children of Yisra’ĕl. 
Exod
24:18  And Mosheh went into the midst of
the cloud and went up into the mountain. And it came to be that Mosheh was on
the mountain forty days and forty nights. 
Exod
25:1  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying,
Exod
25:2  “Speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl,
that they take up a contribution for Me. From everyone whose heart moves him
you shall take up My contribution. 
Exod
25:3  “And this is the contribution which
you take up from them: gold, and silver, and bronze,

the names of the sons of Yisra’ĕl, twelve according to their names, like
the engravings of a signet, each one with its own name, for the twelve tribes. 
Exod
28:22  “And you shall make braided chains
of corded work for the breastplate at the end, of clean gold. 
Exod
28:23  “And you shall make two rings of
gold for the breastplate, and shall put the two rings on the two ends of the
breastplate. 
Exod
28:24  “And you shall put the two cords
of gold in the two rings which are on the ends of the breastplate, 
Exod
28:25  and the other two ends of the two
cords you fasten to the two settings, and put them on the shoulder pieces of
the shoulder garment in the front. 
Exod
28:26  “And you shall make two rings of
gold, and shall put them on the two ends of the breastplate, on the edge of it,
which is on the inner side of the shoulder garment. 
Exod
28:27  “And you shall make two rings of
gold, and put them on the two shoulder pieces, underneath the shoulder garment,
on the front of it, close to the seam above the embroidered band of the
shoulder garment, 
Exod
28:28  and they bind the breastplate by
means of its rings to the rings of the shoulder garment, using a blue cord, so
that it is above the embroidered band of the shoulder garment, so that the
breastplate does not come loose from the shoulder garment. 
Exod
28:29  “And Aharon shall bear the names
of the sons of Yisra’ĕl on the breastplate of right-ruling over his heart,
when he goes into the set-apart place, for a remembrance before יהוה,
continually. 
Exod
28:30  “And into the breastplate of
right-ruling you shall put the Urim and the Tummim, and they shall be on the
heart of Aharon when he goes in before יהוה. And Aharon
shall bear the right-ruling of the children of Yisra’ĕl on his heart
before יהוה, continually.
Exod
28:31  “And you shall make the robe of
the shoulder garment all of blue. 
Exod
28:32  “And the opening for his head
shall be in the middle of it, a woven binding all around its opening, like the
opening in a scaled armour, so that it does not tear. 
Exod
28:33  “And on its hem you shall make
pomegranates of blue and purple and scarlet material,
all around its hem, and bells of gold between them all around: 
Exod
28:34  a golden bell and a pomegranate, a
golden bell and a pomegranate, on the hem of the robe all around. 
Exod
28:35  “And it shall be upon Aharon to
attend in, and its sound shall be heard when he goes into the set-apart place
before יהוה and when he comes out, so that he does not
die. 
Exod
28:36  “And you shall make a plate of
clean gold and engrave on it, like the engraving of a signet: SET-APARTNESS TO יהוה.

Exod
28:37  “And you shall put it on a blue
cord, and it shall be on the turban – it is to be on the front of the turban. 
Exod
28:38  “And it shall be on the forehead
of Aharon, and Aharon shall bear the guilt of the set-apart gifts which the
children of Yisra’ĕl set apart in all their set-apart gifts. And it shall
always be on his forehead, for acceptance for them before יהוה.

Exod
28:39  “And you shall weave the long
shirt of fine linen, and shall make the turban of fine linen, and you shall
make the girdle of woven work. 
Exod
28:40  “And make long shirts for Aharon’s
sons. And you shall make girdles for them, and you shall make turbans for them,
for esteem and comeliness. 
Exod
28:41  “And you shall put them on Aharon
your brother and on his sons with him, and shall anoint them, and shall ordain
them, and shall set them apart, and they shall serve as priests to Me. 
Exod
28:42  “And make linen trousers for them,
to cover their nakedness, reaching from the waist to the thighs. 
Exod
28:43  “And they shall be on Aharon and
on his sons when they come into the Tent of Meeting, or when they come near the
altar to attend in the Set-apart Place, so that they do not bear crookedness
and die – a law forever to him, and to his seed after him. 
Exod
29:1  “And this is the task you shall do
to them to set them apart to serve Me as priests: Take one young bull and two
rams, perfect ones, 
Exod
29:2  and unleavened bread, and
unleavened cakes mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil – make
these of wheat flour. 
Exod
29:3  “And you shall put them in one
basket and bring them in the basket, along with the bull and the two rams. 
Exod
29:4  “Then you shall bring Aharon and
his sons to the door of the Tent of Meeting, and wash them with water. 
Exod
29:5  “And you shall take the garments,
and shall put on Aharon the long shirt, and the robe of the shoulder garment,
and the shoulder garment, and the breastplate, and shall gird him with the
embroidered band of the shoulder garment, 
Exod
29:6  and shall put the turban on his
head, and shall put the set-apart sign of dedication on the turban, 
Exod
29:7  and shall take the anointing oil,
and pour it on his head and anoint him. 
Exod
29:8  “Then you shall bring his sons and
put long shirts on them, 
Exod
29:9  and shall gird them with girdles –
Aharon and his sons – and put the turbans on them. And the priesthood shall be
theirs for an everlasting law. So you shall ordain Aharon and his sons. 
Exod
29:10  “And you shall bring near the bull
before the Tent of Meeting, and Aharon and his sons shall lay their hands on
the head of the bull. 
Exod
29:11  “And you shall slaughter the bull
before יהוה, by the door of the Tent of Meeting, 
Exod
29:12  and take some of the blood of the
bull and put it on the horns of the altar with your finger, and pour all the
blood beside the base of the altar. 
Exod
29:13  “And you shall take all the fat
that covers the entrails, and the appendage on the liver, and the two kidneys
and the fat that is on them, and burn them on the altar. 
Exod
29:14  “But the flesh of the bull, and
its skin and its dung, you shall burn with fire outside the camp. It is a sin
offering. 
Exod
29:15  “And take one ram, and Aharon and
his sons shall lay their hands on the head of the ram, 
Exod
29:16  and you shall slaughter the ram,
and you shall take its blood and sprinkle it all around on the altar. 
Exod
29:17  “And cut the ram in pieces, and
wash its entrails and its legs, and place them upon its pieces and on its head.

Exod
29:18  “And you shall burn the entire ram
on the altar. It is a burnt offering to יהוה, it is a
sweet fragrance, an offering made by fire to יהוה. 
Exod
29:19  “And you shall take the second
ram, and Aharon and his sons shall lay their hands on the head of the ram, 
Exod
29:20  and you shall slaughter the ram,
and take some of its blood and put it on the tip of the right ear of Aharon and
on the tip of the right ear of his sons, on the thumb of their right hand and
on the big toe of their right foot, and sprinkle the blood all around on the
altar. 
Exod
29:21  “And you shall take some of the
blood that is on the altar, and some of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it on
Aharon and on his garments, on his sons and on the garments of his sons with
him. And he and his garments shall be set-apart, and his sons and the garments
of his sons with him. 
Exod
29:22  “And you shall take the fat of the
ram, and the fat tail, and the fat that covers the entrails, and the appendage
on the liver, and the two kidneys and the fat on them, and the right thigh – it
is for a ram of ordination – 
Exod
29:23  and one loaf of bread, and one
cake made with oil, and one thin cake from the basket of the unleavened bread
that is before יהוה. 
Exod
29:24  “And you shall put all these in
the hands of Aharon and in the hands of his sons, and you shall wave them – a
wave offering before יהוה. 
Exod
29:25  “Then you shall take them from
their hands and burn them on the altar as a burnt offering, as a sweet
fragrance before יהוה. It is an offering made by fire
to יהוה. 
Exod
29:26  “And you shall take the breast of
the ram of Aharon’s ordination and wave it – a wave offering before יהוה,
and it shall be your portion. 
Exod
29:27  “And from the ram of ordination
you shall set apart the breast of the wave offering which is waved, and the
thigh of the contribution which is raised, of that which is for Aharon and of
that which is for his sons. 
Exod
29:28  “And it shall be from the children
of Yisra’ĕl for Aharon and his sons by a law forever, for it is a
contribution. And it is a contribution from the children of Yisra’ĕl from
their peace offerings – their contribution to יהוה. 
Exod
29:29  “And the set-apart garments of
Aharon are for his sons after him, to be anointed in them and to be ordained in
them. 
Exod
29:30  “The priest from his sons in his
place, puts them on for seven days, when he enters the Tent of Meeting to
attend in the set-apart place. 
Exod
29:31  “And take the ram of ordination
and cook its flesh in a set-apart place. 
Exod
29:32  “And Aharon and his sons shall eat
the flesh of the ram, and the bread that is in the basket, by the door of the
Tent of Meeting, 
Exod
29:33  and they shall eat those offerings with which the atonement was
made, to ordain them, to set them apart. But let a stranger not eat them,
because they are set-apart. 
Exod
29:34  “And if any of the flesh of the
ordination offerings, or of the bread, be left over until the morning, then you
shall burn up what is left over. It is not eaten, because it is set-apart. 
Exod
29:35  “And so you shall do to Aharon and
his sons, according to all I have commanded you. Seven days you shall ordain
them, 
Exod
29:36  and prepare a bull each day as a
sin offering for atonement. And you shall cleanse the altar when you make
atonement for it, and you shall anoint it to set it apart. 
Exod
29:37  “For seven days you shall make
atonement for the altar, and set it apart. And the altar shall be most
set-apart – whatever touches the altar is to be set-apart. 
Exod
29:38  “And this is what you prepare on
the altar: two lambs, a year old, daily, continually. 
Exod
29:39  “Prepare the one lamb in the
morning, and the other lamb you prepare between the evenings, 
Exod
29:40  and one-tenth of an ĕphah of
flour mixed with one-fourth of a hin of pressed oil, and one-fourth of a hin of
wine as a drink offering, with the one lamb. 
Exod
29:41  “And prepare the other lamb
between the evenings. And with it prepare the grain offering and the drink
offering, as in the morning, for a sweet fragrance, an offering made by fire to
יהוה – 
Exod
29:42  a continual burnt offering for
your generations at the door of the Tent of Meeting before יהוה,
where I shall meet with you to speak with you. 
Exod
29:43  “And there I shall meet with the
children of Yisra’ĕl, and it shall be set apart by My esteem. 
Exod
29:44  “And I shall set apart the Tent of
Meeting and the altar. And Aharon and his sons I set apart to serve as priests
to Me. 
Exod
29:45  “And I shall dwell in the midst of
the children of Yisra’ĕl and shall be their Elohim. 
Exod
29:46  “And they shall know that I am יהוה
their Elohim, who brought them up out of the land of Mitsrayim, to dwell in
their midst. I am יהוה their Elohim. 
Exod
30:1  “And you shall make an altar to
burn incense on, make it of acacia wood, 
Exod
30:2  a cubit long and a cubit wide – it
is a square – and two cubits high, its horns of the same. 
Exod
30:3  “And you shall overlay its top, and
its sides all around, and its horns with clean gold. And you shall make for it
a moulding of gold all around. 
Exod
30:4  “And make two gold rings for it,
under the moulding on both its sides. Make them on its two sides, and they
shall be holders for the poles to lift it with. 
Exod
30:5  “And you shall make the poles of
acacia wood, and overlay them with gold. 
Exod
30:6  “And you shall put it before the
veil that is before the ark of the Witness, before the lid of atonement that is
over the Witness, where I am to meet with you. 
Exod
30:7  “And Aharon shall burn on it sweet
incense, morning by morning. As he tends the lamps, he shall burn incense on
it. 
Exod
30:8  “And when Aharon lights the lamps
between the evenings, he shall burn incense on it – a continual incense before יהוה
throughout your generations. 
Exod
30:9  “Do not offer strange incense on
it, or a burnt offering, or a grain offering, and do not pour a drink offering
on it. 
Exod
30:10  “And Aharon shall make atonement
upon its horns once a year with the blood of the sin offering of atonement –
once a year he makes atonement upon it throughout your generations. It is most
set-apart to יהוה.” 
Exod
30:11  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying, 
Exod
30:12  “When you take the census of the
children of Yisra’ĕl, to register them, then each one shall give an
atonement for his life to יהוה, when you register them,
so that there is no plague among them when you register them. 
Exod
30:13  “Everyone among those who are
registered is to give this: half a sheqel according to the sheqel of the
set-apart place, twenty gĕrahs being a sheqel. The half-sheqel is the
contribution to יהוה. 
Exod
30:14  “Everyone passing over to be
registered, from twenty years old and above, gives a contribution to יהוה.

Exod
30:15  “The rich does not give more and
the poor does not give less than half a sheqel, when you give a contribution to
יהוה, to make atonement for yourselves.
Exod
30:16  “And you shall take the silver for
the atonement from the children of Yisra’ĕl, and give it for the service
of the Tent of Meeting. And it shall be to the children of Yisra’ĕl for a
remembrance before יהוה, to make atonement for
yourselves.”
Exod
30:17  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying, 
Exod
30:18  “And you shall make a basin of
bronze, with its stand also of bronze, for washing. And you shall put it
between the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and shall put water in it. 
Exod
30:19  “And Aharon and his sons shall
wash from it their hands and their feet. 
Exod
30:20  “When they go into the Tent of
Meeting, or when they come near the altar to attend, to burn an offering made
by fire to יהוה, they wash with water, lest they die. 
Exod
30:21  “And they shall wash their hands
and their feet, lest they die. And it shall be a law forever to them, to him
and his seed throughout their generations.” 
Exod
30:22  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying, 
Exod
30:23  “And take for yourself choice
spices, five hundred sheqels of
liquid myrrh, and half as much – two hundred and fifty – of sweet-smelling
cinnamon, and two hundred and fifty of sweet-smelling cane, 
Exod
30:24  and five hundred of cassia,
according to the sheqel of the set-apart place, and a hin of olive oil. 
Exod
30:25  “And you shall make from these a
set-apart anointing oil, a compound, blended, the work of a perfumer. It is a
set-apart anointing oil. 
Exod
30:26  “And with it you shall anoint the
Tent of Meeting and the ark of the Witness, 
Exod
30:27  and the table and all its
utensils, and the lampstand and its utensils, and the altar of incense, 
Exod
30:28  and the altar of burnt offering
with all its utensils, and the basin and its stand. 
Exod
30:29  “And you shall set them apart, and
they shall be most set-apart. Whatever touches them is to be set-apart. 
Exod
30:30  “And you shall anoint Aharon and
his sons, and set them apart, to serve as priests to Me. 
Exod
30:31  “And speak to the children of
Yisra’ĕl, saying, ‘This is a set-apart anointing oil to Me throughout your
generations. 
Exod
30:32  ‘It shall not be poured on the
flesh of a man, and make no other like it, according to its composition. It is
set-apart, it is set-apart to you. 
Exod
30:33  ‘Whoever compounds any like it, or whoever puts any of it
on a stranger, shall be cut off from his people.’ ” 
Exod
30:34  And יהוה
said to Mosheh, “Take sweet spices, fragrant gum and cinnamon and galbanam, and
clear frankincense with these sweet spices, all in equal amounts. 
Exod
30:35  “Then you shall make of these an
incense, a compound, work of a perfumer, salted, clean, set-apart. 
Exod
30:36  “And you shall beat some of it
very fine, and put some of it before the Witness in the Tent of Meeting where I
meet with you, it is most set-apart to you. 
Exod
30:37  “And the incense which you make,
do not make any for yourselves, according to its composition, it is set-apart
to you for יהוה. 
Exod
30:38  “Whoever makes any like it, to smell it, he shall be
cut off from his people.” 
Exod
31:1  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying,
Exod
31:2  “See, I have called by name Betsal’ĕl
son of Uri, son of Ḥur, of the tribe of Yehuḏah, 
Exod
31:3  and I have filled him with the
Spirit of Elohim in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all
work, 
Exod
31:4  to make designs for work in gold,
and in silver, and in bronze, 
Exod
31:5  and in cutting stones for setting,
and in carving wood, and to work in all work. 
Exod
31:6  “And I, look I have appointed with
him Oholiaḇ son of Aḥisamaḵ, of the tribe of Dan. And I have
put wisdom in the hearts of everyone who is wise-hearted, and they shall make
all that I have commanded you: 
Exod
31:7  the Tent of Meeting, and the ark of
the Witness and the lid of atonement that is on it, and all the utensils of the
Tent, 
Exod
31:8  and the table and its utensils, and
the clean gold lampstand with all its utensils, and the altar of incense, 
Exod
31:9  and the altar of burnt offering
with all its utensils, and the basin and its stand, 
Exod
31:10  and the woven garments, and the
set-apart garments for Aharon the priest and the garments of his sons, for
serving as priests, 
Exod
31:11  and the anointing oil and sweet
incense for the Set-apart Place. According to all that I have commanded you,
they are to do.” 
Exod
31:12  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying, 
Exod
31:13  “And you, speak to the children of
Yisra’ĕl, saying, ‘My Sabbaths you are to guard, by all means, for it is a
sign between Me and you throughout your generations, to know that I, יהוה,
am setting you apart.
Exod
31:14  ‘And you shall guard the Sabbath,
for it is set-apart to you. Everyone who profanes it shall certainly be put to
death, for anyone who does work on it, that being shall be cut off from among
his people. 
Exod
31:15  ‘Six days work is done, and on the
seventh is a Sabbath of rest, set-apart to יהוה.
Everyone doing work on the Sabbath day shall certainly be put to death. 
Exod
31:16  ‘And the children of Yisra’ĕl
shall guard the Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath throughout their generations as
an everlasting covenant. 
Exod
31:17  ‘Between Me and the children of
Yisra’ĕl it is a sign forever. For in six days יהוה
made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh day He rested and was
refreshed.’ ” 
Exod
31:18  And when He had ended speaking
with him on Mount Sinai, He gave Mosheh two tablets of the Witness, tablets of
stone, written with the finger of Elohim. 
Exod
32:1  And when the people saw that Mosheh
was so long in coming down from the mountain, the people gathered together to
Aharon, and said to him, “Arise, make us mighty ones who go before us. For this
Mosheh, the man who brought us up out of the land of Mitsrayim, we do not know
what has become of him.” 
Exod
32:2  And Aharon said to them, “Take off
the golden earrings which are in the ears of your wives, your sons, and your
daughters, and bring them to me.” 
Exod
32:3  “And all the people took off the
golden earrings which were in their ears, and brought them to Aharon. 
Exod
32:4  And he took this from their hand, and he formed it with an engraving tool, and
made a moulded calf. And they said, “This is your mighty one, O Yisra’ĕl,
that brought you out of the land of Mitsrayim!” 
Exod
32:5  And Aharon saw and built an altar
before it. And Aharon called out and said, “Tomorrow is a festival to יהוה.”

Exod
32:6  And they rose early on the next
day, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings. And the people
sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play. 
Exod
32:7  And יהוה said
to Mosheh, “Go, get down! For your people whom you brought out of the land of
Mitsrayim have corrupted themselves. 
Exod
32:8  “They have turned aside quickly out
of the way which I commanded them. They have made themselves a moulded calf,
and have bowed themselves to it and slaughtered to it, and said, ‘This is your
mighty one, O Yisra’ĕl, who brought you out of the land of Mitsrayim!’ ” 
Exod
32:9  And יהוה
said to Mosheh, “I have seen this people, and see, it is a stiff-necked people!

Exod
32:10  “And now, let Me alone, that My
wrath might burn against them and I consume them and I make of you a great
nation.” 
Exod
32:11  But Mosheh pleaded with יהוה
his Elohim, and said, “ יהוה, why does Your wrath burn
against Your people whom You have brought out of the land of Mitsrayim with
great power and with a strong hand? 
Exod
32:12  “Why should the Mitsrites speak,
and say, ‘For evil He brought them out to kill them in the mountains, and to
consume them from the face of the earth’? Turn from the heat of Your wrath, and
relent from this evil to Your people. 
Exod
32:13  “Remember Aḇraham,
Yitsḥaq, and Yisra’ĕl, Your servants, to whom You swore by Yourself,
and said to them, ‘I increase your seed like the stars of the heavens. And all
this land that I have spoken of I give to your seed, and they shall inherit it
forever.’ ” 
Exod
32:14  And יהוה
relented from the evil which He said He would do to His people. 
Exod
32:15  And Mosheh turned and went down
from the mountain, and in his hand were the two tablets of the Witness, tablets
written on both their sides, written on the one and on the other. 
Exod
32:16  And the tablets were the work of
Elohim, and the writing was the writing of Elohim engraved on the tablets. 
Exod
32:17  And Yehoshua heard the noise of the
people as they shouted and he said to Mosheh, “A noise of battle in the camp!” 
Exod
32:18  But he said, “It is not the sound
of those who shout of might, nor is it the sound of those who cry out in
weakness, but the sound of singing that I hear.” 
Exod
32:19  And it came to be, as soon as he
came near the camp, that he saw the calf and the dancing. And Mosheh’s
displeasure burned, and he threw the tablets out of his hands and broke them at
the foot of the mountain. 
Exod
32:20  And he took the calf which they
had made, and burned it in the fire, and ground it into powder, and scattered
it on the face of the water and made the children of Yisra’ĕl drink it. 
Exod
32:21  And Mosheh said to Aharon, “What
did this people do to you that you have brought so great a sin upon them?” 
Exod
32:22  And Aharon said, “Do not let the
displeasure of my master burn. You know the people, that it is in evil. 
Exod
32:23  “And they said to me, ‘Make us
mighty ones who go before us. For this Mosheh, the man who brought us out of
the land of Mitsrayim, we do not know what has become of him.’ 
Exod
32:24  “And I said to them, ‘Whoever has
gold, let them take it off.’ And they gave it to me, and I threw it into the
fire, and this calf came out.” 
Exod
32:25  And Mosheh saw that the people
were let loose, for Aharon had let them loose, to their shame among their
enemies. 
Exod
32:26  And Mosheh stood in the entrance
of the camp, and said, “Who is for יהוה ? Come to me.” And all the sons of Lĕwi
gathered themselves to him. 
Exod
32:27  And he said to them, “Thus said יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl: ‘Each one put his sword on his side, pass over to and
fro from gate to gate in the camp, and each one slay his brother, and each one
his friend, and each one his relative.’ ” 
Exod
32:28  And the sons of Lĕwi did
according to the word of Mosheh. And about three thousand men of the people
fell that day. 
Exod
32:29  And Mosheh said, “You are ordained
for יהוה today – since each one has been against his
son and his brother – so as to bring upon you a blessing today.” 
Exod
32:30  And it came to be on the next day
that Mosheh said to the people, “You, you have sinned a great sin. And now I am
going up to יהוה – if I might atone for your sin.” 
Exod
32:31  And Mosheh returned to יהוה
and said, “Oh, these people have sinned a great sin, and have made for
themselves a mighty one of gold! 
Exod
32:32  “And now, if You would forgive
their sin, but if not, please blot me out of Your book which You have written.”

Exod
32:33  And יהוה
said to Mosheh, “Whoever has sinned against Me, I blot him out of My book. 
Exod
32:34  “And now, go, lead the people to
the place of which I have spoken to you. See, My Messenger goes before you. And
in the day of My visitation I shall visit their sin upon them.” 
Exod
32:35  And יהוה
plagued the people because they made the calf, which Aharon made. 
Exod
33:1  And יהוה
said to Mosheh, “Come, go up from here, you and the people whom you have
brought out of the land of Mitsrayim, to the land of which I swore to Aḇraham,
to Yitsḥaq, and to Ya‛aqoḇ, saying, ‘To your seed I give it.’
Exod
33:2  “And I shall send My Messenger
before you, and I shall drive out the Kena‛anite and the Amorite and the Ḥittite
and the Perizzite and the Ḥiwwite and the Yeḇusite, 
Exod
33:3  to a land flowing with milk and
honey. For I do not go up in your midst because you are a stiff-necked people,
lest I consume you on the way.” 
Exod
33:4  And when the people heard this evil
word, they mourned, and no one put on his ornaments. 
Exod
33:5  And יהוה
said to Mosheh, “Say to the children of Yisra’ĕl, ‘You are a stiff-necked
people. Should I go up in your midst for one moment I shall consume you. And
now, take off your ornaments, and I shall know what to do to you.’ ” 
Exod
33:6  So the children of Yisra’ĕl took
off their ornaments at Mount Ḥorĕḇ. 
Exod
33:7  And Mosheh took his tent and
pitched it outside the camp, far from the camp, and called it the Tent of
Meeting. And it came to be that everyone who sought יהוה
went out to the Tent of Meeting which was outside the camp. 
Exod
33:8  And it came to be, whenever Mosheh
went out to the Tent, that all the people rose, and each man stood at his tent
door and watched Mosheh until he entered the Tent. 
Exod
33:9  And it came to be, when Mosheh
entered the Tent, that the column of cloud descended and stood at the door of
the Tent, and He spoke with Mosheh. 
Exod
33:10  And all the people saw the column
of cloud standing at the Tent door, and all the people rose and bowed
themselves, each one at the door of his tent. 
Exod
33:11  Thus יהוה
spoke to Mosheh face to face, as a man speaks to his friend. And he would
return to the camp, but his servant Yehoshua son of Nun, a young man, did not
leave the Tent. 
Exod
33:12  And Mosheh said to יהוה,
“See, You are saying to me, ‘Bring up this people.’ But You have not made known
to me whom You would send with me, though You have said, ‘I know you by name,
and you have also found favour in My eyes.’ 
Exod
33:13  “And now, please, if I have found
favour in Your eyes, please show me Your way, and let me know You, so that I
find favour in Your eyes. And consider that this nation is Your people.” 
Exod
33:14  And He said, “My Presence does go,
and I shall give you rest.” 
Exod
33:15  And he said to Him, “If Your
Presence is not going, do not lead us up from here. 
Exod
33:16  “For how then shall it be known
that I have found favour in Your eyes, I and Your people, except You go with
us? Then we shall be distinguished, I and Your people, from all the people who
are upon the face of the earth.” 
Exod
33:17  And יהוה
said to Mosheh, “Even this word you have spoken I shall do, for you have found
favour in My eyes, and I know you by name.” 
Exod
33:18  Then he said, “Please, show me
Your esteem.” 
Exod
33:19  And He said, “I shall cause all My
goodness to pass before you, and I shall proclaim the Name of יהוה
before you. And I shall favour him whom I favour, and shall have compassion on
him whom I have compassion.” 
Exod
33:20  But He said, “You are unable to
see My face, for no man does see Me and live.” 
Exod
33:21  And יהוה
said, “See, there is a place with Me! And you shall stand on the rock. 
Exod
33:22  “And it shall be, while My esteem
passes by, that I shall put you in the cleft of the rock and cover you with My
hand while I pass by. 
Exod
33:23  “Then I shall take away My hand
and you shall see My back, but My face shall not be seen.” 
Exod
34:1  And יהוה
said to Mosheh, “Cut two tablets of stone like the first ones, and I shall
write on these tablets the Words that were on the first tablets which you
broke. 
Exod
34:2  “And be ready in the morning. Then
you shall come up in the morning to Mount Sinai, and present yourself to Me
there on the top of the mountain. 
Exod
34:3  “And let no man come up with you,
and let no man be seen in all the mountain, and let not even the flock or the
herd feed in front of that mountain.” 
Exod
34:4  And he cut two tablets of stone
like the first ones. Then Mosheh rose early in the morning and went up Mount
Sinai, as יהוה had commanded him, and he took two
tablets of stone in his hand. 
Exod
34:5  And יהוה
came down in the cloud and stood with him there, and proclaimed the Name, יהוה.

Exod
34:6  And יהוה
passed before him and proclaimed, “ יהוה, יהוה,
an Ĕl compassionate and showing favour, patient, and great in kindness and
truth, 
Exod
34:7  watching over kindness for
thousands, forgiving crookedness and transgression and sin, but by no means
leaving unpunished, visiting the crookedness of the fathers upon the children
and the children’s children to the third and the fourth generation.”
Exod
34:8  And Mosheh hurried and bowed
himself toward the earth, and did obeisance, 
Exod
34:9  and said, “If, now, I have found
favour in Your eyes, O יהוה, I pray, let יהוה
go on in our midst, even though we are a stiff-necked people. And forgive our
crookedness and our sin, and take us as Your inheritance.”
Exod
34:10  And He said, “See, I am making a
covenant. Before all your people I am going to do wonders such as have not been
done in all the earth, nor in any nation. And all the people among whom you are
shall see the work of יהוה. For what I am doing with
you is awesome. 
Exod
34:11  “Guard what I command you today.
See, I am driving out from before you the Amorite and the Kena‛anite and
the Ḥittite and the Perizzite and the Ḥiwwite and the Yeḇusite.

Exod
34:12  “Guard yourself, lest you make a
covenant with the inhabitants of the land where you are going, lest it be a
snare in your midst. 
Exod
34:13  “But break down their altars, and
smash their pillars, and cut down their Ashĕrim – 
Exod
34:14  for you do not bow yourselves to
another mighty one, for יהוה, whose Name is jealous, is
a jealous Ĕl – 
Exod
34:15  lest you make a covenant with the
inhabitants of the land, and they whore after their mighty ones, and slaughter
to their mighty ones, and one of them invites you and you eat of his
slaughterings, 
Exod
34:16  and you take of his daughters for
your sons, and his daughters whore after their mighty ones, and make your sons
whore after their mighty ones. 
Exod
34:17  “Do not make a moulded mighty one
for yourselves. 
Exod
34:18  “Guard the Festival of Unleavened
Bread. For seven days you eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you, in the
appointed time of the month of Aḇiḇ, because in the month of Aḇiḇ
you came out from Mitsrayim. 
Exod
34:19  “Everyone opening the womb is
Mine, and every male first-born among your livestock, whether bull or sheep. 
Exod
34:20  “But the first-born of a donkey
you ransom with a lamb. And if you do not ransom, then you shall break his
neck. Every first-born of your sons you shall ransom. And they shall not appear
before Me empty-handed. 
Exod
34:21  “Six days you work, but on the
seventh day you rest – in ploughing time and in harvest you rest. 
Exod
34:22  “And perform the Festival of Weeks
for yourself, of the first-fruits of wheat harvest, and the Festival of
Ingathering at the turn of the year.
Exod
34:23  “Three times in the year all your
men are to appear before the Master, יהוה, the Elohim
of Yisra’ĕl, 
Exod
34:24  for I dispossess nations before
you, and shall enlarge your borders, and let no one covet your land when you go
up to appear before יהוה your Elohim three times in the
year. 
Exod
34:25  “Do not offer the blood of My slaughtering
with leaven, and do not let the slaughtering of the Festival of the Passover
remain until morning. 
Exod
34:26  “Bring the first of the
first-fruits of your land to the House of יהוה your
Elohim. Do not cook a young goat in its mother’s milk.” 
Exod
34:27  And יהוה
said to Mosheh, “Write these Words, for according to the mouth of these Words I
have made a covenant with you and with Yisra’ĕl.” 
Exod
34:28  And he was there with יהוה
forty days and forty nights. He did not eat bread and he did not drink water.
And He wrote on the tablets the Words of the covenant, the Ten Words. 
Exod
34:29  And it came to be, when Mosheh
came down from Mount Sinai, while the two tablets of the Witness were in Mosheh’s
hand when he came down from the mountain, that Mosheh did not know that the
skin of his face shone since he had spoken with Him. 
Exod
34:30  And Aharon and all the children of
Yisra’ĕl looked at Mosheh and saw the skin of his face shone, and they
were afraid to come near him. 
Exod
34:31  But Mosheh called out to them, and
Aharon and all the rulers of the congregation returned to him, and Mosheh spoke
to them. 
Exod
34:32  And afterward all the children of
Yisra’ĕl came near, and he commanded them all that יהוה
had spoken with him on Mount Sinai. 
Exod
34:33  And when Mosheh ended speaking
with them, he put a veil on his face. 
Exod
34:34  But whenever Mosheh went in before
יהוה to speak with Him, he would remove the veil until
he came out. And when he came out he spoke to the children of Yisra’ĕl
what he had been commanded, 
Exod
34:35  and the children of Yisra’ĕl
would see the face of Mosheh, that the skin of Mosheh’s face shone, and Mosheh
would put the veil on his face again, until he went in to speak with Him. 
Exod
35:1  And Mosheh assembled all the
congregation of the children of Yisra’ĕl, and said to them, “These are the
Words which יהוה has commanded you to do:
Exod
35:2  “Work is done for six days, but on
the seventh day it shall be set-apart to you, a Sabbath of rest to יהוה.
Anyone doing work on it is put to death. 
Exod
35:3  “Do not kindle a fire in any of
your dwellings on the Sabbath day.” 
Exod
35:4  And Mosheh spoke to all the
congregation of the children of Yisra’ĕl, saying, “This is the word which יהוה
commanded, saying, 
Exod
35:5  ‘Take from among you a contribution
to יהוה. Everyone whose heart so moves him, let him
bring it as a contribution to יהוה : gold, and silver,
and bronze, 
Exod
35:6  and blue, and purple, and scarlet material, and fine linen, and goats’ hair, 
Exod
35:7  and ram skins dyed red, and fine
leather, and acacia wood, 
Exod
35:8  and oil for the light, and spices
for the anointing oil and for the sweet incense, 
Exod
35:9  and shoham stones, and stones to be
set in the shoulder garment and in the breastplate. 
Exod
35:10  ‘And let all the wise-hearted
among you come and make all that יהוה has commanded: 
Exod
35:11  the Dwelling Place, its tent and
its covering, its hooks and its boards, its bars, its columns, and its sockets,

Exod
35:12  the ark and its poles, the lid of
atonement and the veil of the covering, 
Exod
35:13  the table and its poles, and all
its utensils, and the showbread, 
Exod
35:14  and the lampstand for the light,
and its utensils, and its lamps, and the oil for the light, 
Exod
35:15  and the incense altar, and its
poles, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the covering for the
door at the entrance of the Dwelling Place, 
Exod
35:16  the altar of burnt offering with
its bronze grating, its poles, and all its utensils, the basin and its stand, 
Exod
35:17  the screens of the courtyard, its
columns, and their sockets, and the covering for the gate of the courtyard, 
Exod
35:18  the pegs of the Dwelling Place,
and the pegs of the courtyard, and their cords, 
Exod
35:19  the woven garments to do service
in the set-apart place, the set-apart garments for Aharon the priest and the
garments of his sons to serve as priests.’ ” 
Exod
35:20  And all the congregation of the
children of Yisra’ĕl withdrew from the presence of Mosheh. 
Exod
35:21  And everyone whose heart lifted
him up and everyone whose spirit moved him came, and they brought the
contribution to יהוה for the work of the Tent of
Meeting, and for all its service, and for the set-apart garments. 
Exod
35:22  And they came, both men and women,
all whose hearts moved them, and brought earrings and nose rings, and rings and
necklaces, all golden goods, even every one who made a wave offering of gold to
יהוה. 
Exod
35:23  And every man, with whom was found
blue and purple and scarlet material,
and fine linen, and goats’ hair, and
rams’ skins dyed red, and fine leather, brought them. 
Exod
35:24  Everyone who would make a
contribution to יהוה of silver or bronze, brought it.
And everyone with whom was found acacia wood for any work of the service,
brought it. 
Exod
35:25  And all the wise-hearted women
spun yarn with their hands, and brought what they had spun, the blue and the
purple, the scarlet material, and the
fine linen. 
Exod
35:26  And all the women whose hearts
lifted them up in wisdom spun the goats’ hair.

Exod
35:27  And the rulers brought shoham
stones, and the stones to be set in the shoulder garment and in the
breastplate, 
Exod
35:28  and the spices and the oil for the
light, and for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense. 
Exod
35:29  The children of Yisra’ĕl
brought a voluntary offering to יהוה, all the men and
women whose hearts moved them to bring all kinds of work which יהוה,
by the hand of Mosheh, had commanded to be done. 
Exod
35:30  And Mosheh said to the children of
Yisra’ĕl, “See, יהוה has called by name Betsal’ĕl
son of Uri, son of Ḥur, of the tribe of Yehuḏah, 
Exod
35:31  and He has filled him with the
Spirit of Elohim, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all
work, 
Exod
35:32  to make designs, to work in gold
and in silver and in bronze, 
Exod
35:33  and in cutting of stones for
setting, and in carving wood, and to work in all workmanship of design. 
Exod
35:34  “And He has put in his heart the
ability to teach, in him and Oholiaḇ son of Aḥisamaḵ, of the
tribe of Dan. 
Exod
35:35  “He has filled them with skill to
do all work of the engraver and the designer and embroiderer, in blue and in
purple, in scarlet material, and in
fine linen, and a weaver, doing any work, and makers of designs. 
Exod
36:1  “And Betsal’ĕl and Oholiaḇ,
and every wise-hearted man in whom יהוה has given
wisdom and understanding, to know how to do all work for the service of the
set-apart place, shall do according to all that יהוה
has commanded.” 
Exod
36:2  And Mosheh called Betsal’ĕl
and Oholiaḇ, and every wise-hearted man in whose heart יהוה
had given wisdom, everyone whose heart lifted him up, to come and do the work. 
Exod
36:3  And they received from Mosheh all
the contribution which the children of Yisra’ĕl had brought for the work
of the service of making the set-apart place. But they still brought to him
voluntary offerings every morning, 
Exod
36:4  so all the craftsmen who were doing
all the work of the set-apart place came, each from the work he was doing, 
Exod
36:5  and they spoke to Mosheh, saying, “The
people bring much more than enough for the service of the work which יהוה
commanded us to do.” 
Exod
36:6  Then Mosheh commanded and they sent
this word throughout the camp, saying, “Let neither man nor woman do any more
work for the contribution of the set-apart place.” And the people were withheld
from bringing, 
Exod
36:7  for what they had was enough for
all the work to be done, more than enough. 
Exod
36:8  Then all the wise-hearted ones
among them who worked on the Dwelling Place made ten curtains woven of fine
linen and blue and purple and scarlet material.
They made them with keruḇim, the work of a skilled workman. 
Exod
36:9  The length of each curtain was
twenty-eight cubits, and the width of each curtain four cubits, all the
curtains having one measure. 
Exod
36:10  And he joined five curtains, one
to another; and the other five curtains he joined, one to another. 
Exod
36:11  And he made loops of blue on the
edge of the end curtain of one set, the same he did on the edge of the end
curtain of the other set. 
Exod
36:12  Fifty loops he made on one
curtain, and fifty loops he made on the edge of the end curtain of the second
set; the loops held one curtain to another. 
Exod
36:13  And he made fifty hooks of gold,
and joined the curtains to each other with the hooks, and the Dwelling Place
became one. 
Exod
36:14  And he made curtains of goats’ hair for the tent over the Dwelling
Place, he made eleven curtains. 
Exod
36:15  The length of each curtain was
thirty cubits, and the width of each curtain four cubits, the eleven curtains
having one measure. 
Exod
36:16  And he joined five curtains by
themselves and six curtains by themselves. 
Exod
36:17  And he made fifty loops on the
edge of the end curtain in one set, and fifty loops he made on the edge of the
curtain of the second set. 
Exod
36:18  And he made fifty bronze hooks to
join the tent, to be one. 
Exod
36:19  And he made a covering for the
tent of rams’ skins, dyed red, and a covering of fine leather above that. 
Exod
36:20  And for the Dwelling Place he made
boards of acacia wood, standing up. 
Exod
36:21  The length of each board was ten
cubits, and the width of each board a cubit and a half. 
Exod
36:22  Each board had two tenons for
binding one to another. So he did to all the boards of the Dwelling Place. 
Exod
36:23  And he made boards for the
Dwelling Place, twenty boards for the south side. 
Exod
36:24  And he made forty sockets of
silver to go under the twenty boards, and two sockets under each of the boards
for its two tenons. 
Exod
36:25  And for the other side of the
Dwelling Place, for the north side, he made twenty boards, 
Exod
36:26  and their forty sockets of silver,
two sockets under the one board, and two sockets under the other board. 
Exod
36:27  And he made six boards for the
west side of the Dwelling Place. 
Exod
36:28  And he made two boards for the two
back corners of the Dwelling Place. 
Exod
36:29  And they were double beneath, and
similarly they were complete to the top by one ring. So he did to both of them
for the two corners. 
Exod
36:30  And there were eight boards, and
their silver sockets, sixteen sockets, two sockets under each of the boards. 
Exod
36:31  And he made bars of acacia wood,
five for the boards on one side of the Dwelling Place, 
Exod
36:32  and five bars for the boards on
the other side of the Dwelling Place, and five bars for the boards of the
Dwelling Place at the rear, westward. 
Exod
36:33  And he made the middle bar to pass
through the boards from one end to the other. 
Exod
36:34  And he overlaid the boards with
gold, and their rings he made of gold to be holders for the bars, and overlaid
the bars with gold. 
Exod
36:35  And he made a veil of blue and
purple and scarlet material, and fine
worked linen. It was made with keruḇim, the work of a skilled workman. 
Exod
36:36  And he made four columns of acacia
wood for it, and overlaid them with gold, with their hooks of gold. And he cast
four sockets of silver for them. 
Exod
36:37  And he made a covering for the
Tent door of blue and purple and scarlet material
and fine woven linen, made by a weaver, 
Exod
36:38  and its five columns with their
hooks. And he overlaid their tops and their rings with gold, but their five
sockets were of bronze. 
Exod
37:1  And Betsal’ĕl made the ark of
acacia wood, two and a half cubits long, and a cubit and a half wide, and a
cubit and a half high. 
Exod
37:2  And he overlaid it with clean gold
inside and outside, and made a moulding of gold all around it. 
Exod
37:3  And he cast four rings of gold for
it, for its four feet, two rings on its one side, and two rings on its other
side. 
Exod
37:4  And he made poles of acacia wood,
and overlaid them with gold. 
Exod
37:5  And he put the poles into the rings
at the sides of the ark, to lift the ark. 
Exod
37:6  And he made a lid of atonement of
clean gold, two and a half cubits long and a cubit and a half wide. 
Exod
37:7  And he made two keruḇim of
beaten gold. He made them from the two ends of the lid of atonement, 
Exod
37:8  one keruḇ at one end on this
side, and the other keruḇ at the other end on that side. He made the keruḇim
from the lid of atonement, from the two ends. 
Exod
37:9  And the keruḇim spread out
their wings above, and covered the lid of atonement with their wings, with
their faces toward each other, the faces of the keruḇim were turned toward the lid of atonement. 
Exod
37:10  And he made the table of acacia
wood, two cubits long, and a cubit wide, and a cubit and a half high. 
Exod
37:11  And he overlaid it with clean
gold, and made a moulding of gold all around it. 
Exod
37:12  And he made a rim of a handbreadth
all around it, and made a moulding of gold for the rim all around it. 
Exod
37:13  And he cast four rings of gold for
it, and put the rings on the four corners that were at its four legs. 
Exod
37:14  The rings were next to the rim, as
holders for the poles to lift the table. 
Exod
37:15  And he made the poles of acacia
wood to lift the table, and overlaid them with gold. 
Exod
37:16  And he made the utensils which
were on the table, its dishes, and its cups, and its bowls, and its jars for
pouring, of clean gold. 
Exod
37:17  And he made the lampstand of clean
gold. He made the lampstand of beaten work, its base, and its shaft, its cups,
its ornamental knobs, and its blossoms were from it. 
Exod
37:18  And six branches came out of its
sides: three branches of the lampstand out of one side, and three branches of
the lampstand out of the other side. 
Exod
37:19  There were three cups like almond
flowers on one branch, with ornamental knob and blossom, and three cups like
almond flowers on the other branch, a knob and a blossom – so for the six branches
coming out of the lampstand. 
Exod
37:20  And on the lampstand were four
cups like almond flowers, its knobs and blossoms,
Exod
37:21  and a knob under the first two
branches of the same, and a knob under the second two branches of the same, and
a knob under the third two branches of the same, for the six branches coming
out of it. 
Exod
37:22  Their knobs and their branches
were of it, all of it was one beaten work of clean gold. 
Exod
37:23  And he made its seven lamps, and
its snuffers, and its trays, of clean gold. 
Exod
37:24  He made it of a talent of clean
gold, and all its utensils. 
Exod
37:25  And he made the incense altar of
acacia wood, a cubit long and a cubit wide, square, and two cubits high. Its
horns were of it. 
Exod
37:26  And he overlaid it with clean
gold, its top and its sides all around, and its horns. And he made a moulding
for it of gold all around it. 
Exod
37:27  And he made two rings of gold for
it under its moulding, at its two corners on both sides, as holders for the
poles with which to lift it. 
Exod
37:28  And he made the poles of acacia
wood, and overlaid them with gold. 
Exod
37:29  And he made the set-apart
anointing oil and the clean incense of sweet spices, according to the work of
the perfumer. 
Exod
38:1  And he made the altar of burnt
offering of acacia wood, five cubits long and five cubits wide, square, and
three cubits high. 
Exod
38:2  And he made its horns on its four
corners, the horns were of it. And he overlaid it with bronze. 
Exod
38:3  And he made all the utensils for
the altar: the pots, and the shovels, and the basins, and the forks, and the
fire holders. He made all its utensils of bronze. 
Exod
38:4  And he made a grating for the
altar, a bronze network, under its rim, midway from the bottom. 
Exod
38:5  And he cast four rings for the four
corners of the bronze grating, as holders for the poles. 
Exod
38:6  And he made the poles of acacia
wood, and overlaid them with bronze. 
Exod

Exod
40:1  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying,
Exod
40:2  “On the first day of the first
month, you are to raise up the Dwelling Place of the Tent of Meeting, 
Exod
40:3  and shall put in it the ark of the
Witness, and screen the ark with the veil. 
Exod
40:4  “And you shall bring in the table
and arrange what belongs on it, and bring in the lampstand and light its lamps.

Exod
40:5  “And you shall set the altar of
gold for the incense before the ark of the Witness, and put up the covering of
the door to the Dwelling Place. 
Exod
40:6  “And you shall set the altar of the

Exod
40:7  and shall set the basin between the

Exod
40:8  “And you shall set up the courtyard
all around, and shall place the covering of the courtyard gate, 
Exod
40:9  and shall take the anointing oil,
and anoint the Dwelling Place and all that is in it, and shall set it and all
its utensils apart, and it shall be set-apart. 
Exod
40:10  “And you shall anoint the altar of
the burnt offering and all its utensils, and set the altar apart, and the altar
shall be most set-apart. 
Exod
40:11  “And you shall anoint the basin
and its stand, and set it apart. 
Exod
40:12  “And you shall bring Aharon and
his sons to the door of the Tent of Meeting and wash them with water. 
Exod
40:13  “And you shall put the set-apart
garments on Aharon, and anoint him and set him apart to serve as priest to Me. 
Exod
40:14  “And you shall bring his sons and
put long shirts on them, 
Exod
40:15  and shall anoint them, as you
anointed their father, and they shall serve as priests to Me. And their
anointing shall be for them an everlasting priesthood throughout their
generations.” 
Exod
40:16  And Mosheh did according to all
that יהוה had commanded him, so he did. 
Exod
40:17  And it came to be in the first
month of the second year, on the first day of the month, that the Dwelling
Place was raised up. 
Exod
40:18  And Mosheh raised up the Dwelling
Place and placed its sockets, and set up its boards, and put in its bars, and
raised up its columns, 
Exod
40:19  and spread the tent over the
Dwelling Place and put the covering of the tent on top of it, as יהוה
had commanded Mosheh. 
Exod
40:20  And he took the Witness and put it
into the ark, and he put the poles through the rings of the ark, and put the
lid of atonement on top of the ark, 
Exod
40:21  and brought the ark into the
Dwelling Place, and placed the veil of the covering to screen off the ark of
the Witness, as יהוה had commanded Mosheh. 
Exod
40:22  And he put the table in the Tent
of Meeting, on the north side of the Dwelling Place, outside the veil, 
Exod
40:23  and set the bread in order upon it
before יהוה, as יהוה had
commanded Mosheh. 
Exod
40:24  And he put the lampstand in the
Tent of Meeting, opposite the table, on the south side of the Dwelling Place, 
Exod
40:25  and lit the lamps before יהוה,
as יהוה had commanded Mosheh. 
Exod
40:26  And he put the gold altar in the
Tent of Meeting in front of the veil, 
Exod
40:27  and burned sweet incense on it, as
יהוה had commanded Mosheh. 
Exod
40:28  And he set up the covering to the
door of the Dwelling Place. 
Exod
40:29  And he put the altar of burnt
offering before the door of the Dwelling Place of the Tent of Meeting, and
offered upon it the burnt offering and the grain offering, as יהוה
had commanded Mosheh. 
Exod
40:30  And he put the basin between the
Tent of Meeting and the altar, and put water therein for washing. 
Exod
40:31  And Mosheh, and Aharon, and his
sons washed their hands and their feet with water from it, 
Exod
40:32  as they went into the Tent of
Meeting, and as they came near the altar. They would wash, as יהוה
had commanded Mosheh. 
Exod
40:33  And he raised up the courtyard all
around the Dwelling Place and the altar, and placed the covering of the
courtyard gate. And Mosheh completed the work. 
Exod
40:34  And the cloud covered the Tent of
Meeting, and the esteem of יהוה filled the Dwelling
Place. 
Exod
40:35  And Mosheh was not able to come
into the Tent of Meeting, because the cloud dwelt on it, and the esteem of יהוה
filled the Dwelling Place. 
Exod
40:36  And when the cloud was taken up
from above the Dwelling Place, the children of Yisra’ĕl went onward in all
their journeys. 
Exod
40:37  But if the cloud was not taken up,
then they did not set out till the day that it was taken up. 
Exod
40:38  For the cloud of יהוה
was on the Dwelling Place by day, and fire was on it by night, before the eyes
of all the house of Yisra’ĕl, in all their journeys.
