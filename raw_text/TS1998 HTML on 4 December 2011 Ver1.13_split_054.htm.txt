Yoḥanan/John
John
1:1  In the beginning was the Word, and
the Word was with Elohim, and the Word was Elohim. 
John
1:2  He was in the beginning with Elohim.

John
1:3  All came to be through Him, and
without Him not even one came to be that came to be.
John
1:4  In Him was life, and the life was
the light of men. 
John
1:5  And the light shines in the
darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it. 
John
1:6  There was a man sent from Elohim,
whose name was Yoḥanan. 
John
1:7  This one came for a witness, to bear
witness of the Light, that all might believe through him. 
John
1:8  He was not that Light, but that he
might bear witness of that Light. 
John
1:9  He was the true Light, which
enlightens every man, coming into the world. 
John
1:10  He was in the world, and the world
came to be through Him, and the world did not know Him. 
John
1:11  He came to His own, and His own did
not receive Him. 
John
1:12  But as many as received Him, to
them He gave the authority to become children of Elohim, to those believing in
His Name, 
John
1:13  who were born, not of blood nor of
the desire of flesh nor of the desire of man, but of Elohim. 
John
1:14  And the Word became flesh and
pitched His tent among us, and we saw His esteem, esteem as of an only
brought-forth of a father, complete in favour and truth.
John
1:15  Yoḥanan bore witness of Him
and cried out, saying, “This was He of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me has
become before me, because He was before me.’ ” 
John
1:16  And out of His completeness we all
did receive, and favour upon favour, 
John
1:17  for the Torah was given through
Mosheh – the favour and the truth came through יהושע
Messiah. 
John
1:18  No one has ever seen Elohim. The
only brought-forth Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He did declare.
John
1:19  Now this was the witness of
Yoḥanan when the Yehuḏim sent from Yerushalayim priests and Lĕwites
to ask him, “Who are you?” 
John
1:20  And he confessed, and did not deny,
but confessed, “I am not the Messiah.” 
John
1:21  And they asked him, “What then, are
you Ĕliyahu?” So he said, “I am not.” “Are you the Prophet?” And he
answered, “No.” 
John
1:22  Therefore they said to him, “Who
are you, so that we give an answer to those who sent us? What do you say about
yourself?” 
John
1:23  He said, “I am a voice of one
crying in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way of יהוה,’
as the prophet Yeshayahu said.” 
John
1:24  And those sent were of the
Pharisees, 
John
1:25  and they asked him, saying, “Why
then do you immerse if you are not the Messiah, nor Ĕliyahu, nor the
Prophet?” 
John
1:26  Yoḥanan answered them,
saying, “I immerse in water, but in your midst stands One whom you do not know,

John
1:27  the One coming after me, who has
become before me, whose sandal strap I am not worthy to loosen.” 
John
1:28  This took place in Bĕyth Anyah
beyond the Yardĕn, where Yoḥanan was immersing. 
John
1:29  On the next day Yoḥanan saw יהושע
coming toward him, and said, “See, the Lamb of Elohim who takes away the sin of
the world!
John
1:30  “This is He of whom I said, ‘After
me comes a Man who has become before me, for He was before me.’
John
1:31  “And I did not know Him, but that
He might be revealed to Yisra’ĕl, therefore I came immersing in water.” 
John
1:32  And Yoḥanan bore witness,
saying, “I have seen the Spirit coming down from heaven like a dove and remain
on Him. 
John
1:33  “And I did not know Him, but He who
sent me to immerse in water said to me, ‘Upon whom you see the Spirit coming
down and remaining on Him, this is He who immerses in the Set-apart Spirit.’ 
John
1:34  “And I have seen and have witnessed
that this is the Son of Elohim.” 
John
1:35  Again the following day,
Yoḥanan was standing with two of his taught ones, 
John
1:36  and looking at יהושע
walking, he said, “See the Lamb of Elohim!” 
John
1:37  And the two taught ones heard him
speaking, and they followed יהושע. 
John
1:38  And יהושע
turning, and seeing them following, said to them, “What do you seek?” And they
said to Him, “Rabbi” (which means Teacher), “where are You staying?” 
John
1:39  He said to them, “Come and see.”
They went and saw where He was staying, and remained with Him that day. Now it
was about the tenth hour. 
John
1:40  Andri, the brother of Shim‛on
Kĕpha, was one of the two who heard from Yoḥanan, and followed Him. 
John
1:41  First he found his own brother Shim‛on,
and said to him, “We have found the Messiah” (which means the Anointed). 
John
1:42  And he brought him to יהושע.
And looking at him, יהושע said, “You are Shim‛on
the son of Yonah, you shall be called Kĕpha” (which means A Stone). 
John
1:43  On the following day יהושע
wished to go to Galil, and He found Philip and said to him, “Follow Me.” 
John
1:44  And Philip was from Bĕyth Tsaiḏa,
the city of Andri and Kĕpha. 
John
1:45  Philip found Nethanĕ’l and
said to him, “We have found Him whom Mosheh wrote of in the Torah, and the
prophets: יהושע of Natsareth – the son of Yosĕph.”

John
1:46  And Nethanĕ’l said to him, “Is
it possible for any good matter to
come out of Natsareth?” Philip said to him, “Come and see.” 
John
1:47  יהושע
saw Nethanĕ’l coming toward Him, and said of him, “See, truly a Yisra’ĕlite,
in whom is no deceit!” 
John
1:48  Nethanĕ’l said to Him, “From
where do You know me?” יהושע answered and said to
him, “Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.” 
John
1:49  Nethanĕ’l answered and said to
Him, “Rabbi, You are the Son of Elohim! You are the Sovereign of Yisra’ĕl!”

John
1:50  יהושע
answered and said to him, “Because I said to you, ‘I saw you under the fig tree,’
do you believe? Greater than that you shall see.” 
John
1:51  And He said to him, “Truly, truly,
I say to you, from now on you shall see the heaven opened, and the messengers
of Elohim ascending and descending upon the Son of Aḏam.” 
John
2:1  And on the third day there was a
wedding in Qanah of Galil, and the mother of יהושע
was there. 
John
2:2  And both יהושע
and His taught ones were invited to the wedding. 
John
2:3  And when they were short of wine,
the mother of יהושע said to Him, “They have no wine.”

John
2:4  יהושע
said to her, “Woman, what is that to Me and to you? My hour has not yet come.” 
John
2:5  His mother said to the servants, “Do
whatever He says to you.” 
John
2:6  And there were six stone water-jugs
standing there, according to the mode of cleansing of the Yehuḏim, each
holding two or three measures. 
John
2:7  יהושע
said to them, “Fill the water-jugs with water.” And they filled them up to the
brim. 
John
2:8  And He said to them, “Now draw out
and take it to the master of the feast.” So they took it. 
John
2:9  But when the master of the feast had
tasted the water that had become wine, and did not know where it came from –
though the servants who had drawn the water knew – the master of the feast
called the bridegroom, 
John
2:10  and said to him, “Every man at the
beginning sets out the good wine, and when they have drunk, then that which is
poorer. You have kept the good wine until now.” 
John
2:11  This, the beginning of the signs, יהושע
did in Qanah of Galil, and manifested His esteem. And His taught ones believed
in Him. 
John
2:12  After this He went down to Kephar
Naḥum, He and His mother, and His brothers, and His taught ones. And
there they stayed not many days. 
John
2:13  And the Passover of the Yehuḏim
was near, and יהושע went up to Yerushalayim. 
John
2:14  And He found in the Set-apart Place
those selling oxen and sheep and doves, and the moneychangers sitting. 
John
2:15  And having made a whip of cords, He
drove them all out of the Set-apart Place, with the sheep and the oxen, and
poured out the moneychangers’ coins and overturned the tables. 
John
2:16  And He said to those selling doves,
“Take these away! Do not make the house of My Father a house of merchandise!” 
John
2:17  And His taught ones remembered that
it was written, “The ardour for Your house has eaten Me up.” 
John
2:18  And the Yehuḏim answered and
said to Him, “What sign do You show to us, since You are doing these?” 
John
2:19  יהושע
answered and said to them, “Destroy this Dwelling Place, and in three days I
shall raise it.” 
John
2:20  Then the Yehuḏim said, “It
took forty-six years to build this Dwelling Place, and You are going to raise
it in three days?” 
John
2:21  But He spoke about the Dwelling
Place of His body. 
John
2:22  So, when He was raised from the
dead, His taught ones remembered that He said this to them. And they believed
the Scripture and the word which יהושע had said. 
John
2:23  And when He was in Yerushalayim at
the Passover, at the festival, many believed in His Name when they saw the
signs which He was doing. 
John
2:24  But יהושע
was not entrusting Himself to them, because He knew all men, 
John
2:25  and had no need that anyone should
witness of man, for He knew what was in man. 
John
3:1  And there was a man of the
Pharisees, Naḵdimon was his name, a ruler of the Yehuḏim. 
John
3:2  This one came to יהושע
by night and said to Him, “Rabbi, we know that You are a teacher come from
Elohim, for no one is able to do these signs You do if Elohim is not with him.”

John
3:3  יהושע
answered and said to him, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born from
above, he is unable to see the reign of Elohim.”
John
3:4  Naḵdimon said to Him, “How is
a man able to be born when he is old? Is he able to enter into his mother’s
womb a second time and be born?” 
John
3:5  יהושע
answered, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the
Spirit, he is unable to enter into the reign of Elohim. 
John
3:6  “That which has been born of the
flesh is flesh, and that which has been born of the Spirit is spirit. 
John
3:7  “Do not marvel that I said to you, ‘You
have to be born from above.’ 
John
3:8  “The Spirit breathes where it
wishes, and you hear the sound of it, but do not know where it comes from and
where it goes. So is everyone who has been born of the Spirit.”
John
3:9  Naḵdimon answered and said to
Him, “How is it possible for this to take place?” 
John
3:10  יהושע
answered and said to him, “Are you the teacher of Yisra’ĕl, and do not
know this? 
John
3:11  “Truly, truly, I say to you, We
speak what We know and witness what We have seen, and you do not receive Our
witness. 
John
3:12  “If you do not believe when I spoke
to you about earthly matters, how are
you going to believe when I speak to you about the heavenly matters? 
John
3:13  “And no one has gone up into the
heaven except He who came down from the heaven – the Son of Aḏam. 
John
3:14  “And as Mosheh lifted up the
serpent in the wilderness, even so the Son of Aḏam has to be lifted up, 
John
3:15  so that whoever is believing in Him
should not perish but possess everlasting life. 
John
3:16  “For Elohim so loved the world that
He gave His only brought-forth Son, so that everyone who believes in Him should
not perish but possess everlasting life. 
John
3:17  “For Elohim did not send His Son
into the world to judge the world, but that the world through Him might be
saved. 
John
3:18  “He who believes in Him is not
judged, but he who does not believe is judged already, because he has not
believed in the Name of the only brought-forth Son of Elohim. 
John
3:19  “And this is the judgment, that the
light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the
light, for their works were wicked. 
John
3:20  “For everyone who is practising
evil matters hates the light and does
not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed. 
John
3:21  “But the one doing the truth comes
to the light, so that his works are clearly seen, that they have been wrought
in Elohim.” 
John
3:22  After this, יהושע
and His taught ones came into the land of Yehuḏah, and He remained there
with them, and was immersing. 
John
3:23  And Yoḥanan was also
immersing in Ayin near Salim, because there was plenty of water there. And they
were coming and were being immersed, 
John
3:24  for Yoḥanan had not yet been
put into prison. 
John
3:25  Then a dispute arose between some
of Yoḥanan’s taught ones and the Yehuḏim about cleansing, 
John
3:26  and they came to Yoḥanan and
said to him, “Rabbi, He who was with you beyond the Yardĕn, to whom you have
witnessed, see, He is immersing, and all are coming to Him!” 
John
3:27  Yoḥanan answered and said, “No
man is able to receive any matter
unless it is given to him from the heaven. 
John
3:28  “You yourselves are witnesses for
me that I said, ‘I am not the Messiah but I am sent ahead of Him.’ 
John
3:29  “He that has the bride is the
bridegroom, but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him,
rejoices greatly because of the voice of the bridegroom. So this joy of mine is
complete. 
John
3:30  “It is right for Him to increase,
but me to decrease. 
John
3:31  “He who comes from above is over
all, he who is from the earth is of the earth and speaks of the earth. He who
comes from the heaven is over all. 
John
3:32  “And what He has seen and heard,
that He witnesses. And no one receives His witness. 
John
3:33  “He who receives His witness has
set his seal that Elohim is true. 
John
3:34  “For He whom Elohim has sent speaks
the Words of Elohim, for Elohim does not give the Spirit by measure. 
John
3:35  “The Father loves the Son, and has
given all into His hand. 
John
3:36  “He who believes in the Son
possesses everlasting life, but he who does not obey the Son shall not see
life, but the wrath of Elohim remains on him.” 
John
4:1  So when the Master knew that the
Pharisees had heard that יהושע made and immersed
more taught ones than Yoḥanan – 
John
4:2  although יהושע
Himself did not immerse, but His taught ones – 
John
4:3  He left Yehuḏah and went away
again to Galil. 
John
4:4  And He had to pass through Shomeron.

John
4:5  So He came to a city of Shomeron,
called Sheḵem, near the piece of land Ya‛aqoḇ gave to his son
Yosĕph. 
John
4:6  And Ya‛aqoḇ’s fountain
was there. So יהושע, being wearied from the
journey, was sitting thus at the fountain. It was about the sixth hour. 
John
4:7  A woman of Shomeron came to draw
water. יהושע said to her, “Give Me to drink.” 
John
4:8  For His taught ones had gone off
into the city to buy food. 
John
4:9  The woman of Shomeron therefore said
to Him, “How is it that You, being a Yehuḏite, ask a drink from me, a
woman of Shomeron?” For Yehuḏim do not associate with Shomeronites. 
John
4:10  יהושע
answered and said to her, “If you knew the gift of Elohim, and who it is who
says to you, ‘Give Me to drink,’ you would have asked Him, and He would have
given you living water.”
John
4:11  The woman said to Him, “Master, You
have no vessel, and the well is deep. From where, then, do You have living
water? 
John
4:12  “Are You greater than our father Ya‛aqoḇ,
who gave us the well, and drank from it himself, and his sons, and his cattle?”

John
4:13  יהושע
answered and said to her, “Everyone drinking of this water shall thirst again, 
John
4:14  but whoever drinks of the water I
give him shall certainly never thirst. And the water that I give him shall
become in him a fountain of water springing up into everlasting life.” 
John
4:15  The woman said to Him, “Master,
give me this water, so that I do not thirst, nor come here to draw.” 
John
4:16  יהושע
said to her, “Go, call your husband, and come here.” 
John
4:17  The woman answered and said, “I
have no husband.” יהושע said to her, “You have
well said, ‘I have no husband,’ 
John
4:18  for you have had five husbands, and
the one whom you now have is not your husband. What you have said is true.” 
John
4:19  The woman said to Him, “Master, I
see that You are a prophet. 
John
4:20  “Our fathers worshipped on this
mountain, but you people say that in
Yerushalayim is the place where one needs to worship.” 
John
4:21  יהושע
said to her, “Woman, believe Me, the hour is coming when you shall neither on
this mountain, nor in Yerushalayim, worship the Father. 
John
4:22  “You worship what you do not know.
We worship what we know, because the deliverance is of the Yehuḏim.
John
4:23  “But the hour is coming, and now
is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth, for
the Father also does seek such to worship Him. 
John
4:24  “Elohim is Spirit, and those who
worship Him need to worship in spirit and truth.” 
John
4:25  The woman said to Him, “I know that
Messiah is coming, the One who is called Anointed. When that One comes, He
shall announce to us all.” 
John
4:26  יהושע
said to her, “I who am speaking to you am He.” 
John
4:27  And upon this His taught ones came,
and they were marvelling that He was speaking with a woman, however, no one
said, “What do You seek?” or, “Why do You speak with her?” 
John
4:28  The woman then left her water-jug,
and went away to the city, and said to the men, 
John
4:29  “Come, see a Man who told me all
that I have done. Is this not the Messiah?” 
John
4:30  They went out of the city and were
coming to Him. 
John
4:31  But in the meantime His taught ones
were asking Him, saying, “Rabbi, eat.” 
John
4:32  And He said to them, “I have food
to eat of which you do not know.” 
John
4:33  Then the taught ones said to each
other, “Did anyone bring Him food to
eat?” 
John
4:34  יהושע
said to them, “My food is to do the desire of Him who sent Me, and to
accomplish His work. 
John
4:35  “Do you not say, ‘There are still
four months, and the harvest comes’? See, I say to you, lift up your eyes and
see the fields, for they are white for harvest – already! 
John
4:36  “He who is reaping receives a
reward, and gathers fruit for everlasting life, so that both he who is sowing
and he who is reaping rejoice together. 
John
4:37  “For in this the word is true, ‘One
sows and another reaps.’ 
John
4:38  “I sent you to reap that for which
you have not laboured. Others have laboured, and you have entered into their
labours.” 
John
4:39  And many of the Shomeronites of
that city believed in Him because of the word of the woman who witnessed, “He
told me all that I have done.” 
John
4:40  Therefore when the Shomeronites
came to Him, they were asking Him to stay with them, and He stayed there two
days. 
John
4:41  And many more believed because of
His word. 
John
4:42  And they said to the woman, “We no
longer believe because of what you said, for we ourselves have heard, and we
know that this is truly the Messiah, the Saviour of the world.” 
John
4:43  And after the two days He left
there and went to Galil. 
John
4:44  For יהושע
Himself witnessed that a prophet is without appreciation in his own country. 
John
4:45  Therefore when He came to Galil,
the Galileans received Him, having seen all that He had done in Yerushalayim at
the festival, for they also went to the festival. 
John
4:46  Then יהושע
came again to Qanah of Galil where He had made the water wine. And there was a
certain nobleman whose son was sick at Kephar Naḥum. 
John
4:47  When he heard that יהושע
had come from Yehuḏah into Galil, he went to Him and was asking Him to
come down and heal his son, for he was about to die. 
John
4:48  יהושע
then said to him, “If you people do not
see signs and wonders, you do not believe at all.” 
John
4:49  The nobleman said to Him, “Master,
come down before my child dies!” 
John
4:50  יהושע
said to him, “Go, your son lives.” And the man believed the word that יהושע
spoke to him, and went. 
John
4:51  And while he was going down, his
servants met him and reported, saying, “Your son lives!” 
John
4:52  He then asked from them the hour in
which he became better, and they said to him, “Yesterday at the seventh hour
the inflammation left him.” 
John
4:53  Then the father knew that it was at
the same hour in which יהושע said to him, “Your
son lives.” And he himself believed, and all his household. 
John
4:54  Again this was the second sign יהושע
did, when He had come from Yehuḏah into Galil. 
John
5:1  After this there was a festival of
the Yehuḏim, and יהושע went up to
Yerushalayim. 
John
5:2  And in Yerushalayim at the Sheep Gate there is a pool, which is called in
Heḇrew, Bĕyth Zatha, having five porches. 
John
5:3  In these were lying a great number
of those who were sick, blind, crippled, paralysed, waiting for the stirring of
the water. 
John
5:4  For a messenger was going down at a
certain time into the pool and was stirring the water. Whoever stepped in
first, then, after the stirring of the water, became well of whatever disease
he had. 
John
5:5  And a certain man was there who had
a sickness thirty-eight years. 
John
5:6  When יהושע
saw him lying there, and knowing that he already had been a long time, He said
to him, “Do you wish to become well?” 
John
5:7  The sick man answered Him, “Master,
I have no man to put me into the pool when the water is stirred, but while I am
coming, another steps down before me.” 
John
5:8  יהושע
said to him, “Rise, take up your bed and walk.” 
John
5:9  And immediately the man became well,
and he took up his bed and was walking. Now it was Sabbath on that day. 
John
5:10  The Yehuḏim therefore said to
him who had been healed, “It is the Sabbath, it is not right for you to take up
the bed.” 
John
5:11  He answered them, “He who made me
well said to me, ‘Take up your bed and walk.’ ” 
John
5:12  Therefore they asked him, “Who is
the Man who said to you, ‘Take up your bed and walk’?” 
John
5:13  But the one who was healed did not
know who it was, for יהושע had moved away, a
crowd being in that place. 
John
5:14  Afterward יהושע
found him in the Set-apart Place, and said to him, “See, you have been made
well. Sin no more, so that no worse matter
befalls you.”
John
5:15  The man went away, and told the
Yehuḏim that it was יהושע who made him
well. 
John
5:16  And because of this the Yehuḏim
persecuted יהושע, and were seeking to kill Him,
because He was doing these healings
on the Sabbath. 
John
5:17  But יהושע
answered them, “My Father works until now, and I work.” 
John
5:18  Because of this, then, the Yehuḏim
were seeking all the more to kill Him, ‘because not only was He breaking the
Sabbath, but He also called Elohim His own Father, making Himself equal with
Elohim.’ 
John
5:19  Therefore יהושע
responded and said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son is able to do
none at all by Himself, but only that which He sees the Father doing, because
whatever He does, the Son also likewise does. 
John
5:20  “For the Father loves the Son, and
shows Him all that He Himself does. And greater works than these He is going to
show Him, in order that you marvel. 
John
5:21  “For as the Father raises the dead
and makes alive, even so the Son makes alive whom He wishes. 
John
5:22  “For the Father judges no one, but
has given all the judgment to the Son, 
John
5:23  that all should value the Son even
as they value the Father. He who does not value the Son does not value the
Father who sent Him. 
John
5:24  “Truly, truly, I say to you, he who
hears My word and believes in Him who sent Me possesses everlasting life, and
does not come into judgment, but has passed from death into life. 
John
5:25  “Truly, truly, I say to you, the
hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of
Elohim. And those having heard shall live. 
John
5:26  “For as the Father possesses life
in Himself, so He gave also to the Son to possess life in Himself, 
John
5:27  and He has given Him authority also
to do judgment, because He is the Son of Aḏam. 
John
5:28  “Do not marvel at this, because the
hour is coming in which all those in the tombs shall hear His voice, 
John
5:29  and shall come forth – those who
have done good, to the resurrection of life, and those who have practised evil matters, to a resurrection of judgment. 
John
5:30  “Of Myself I am unable to do any matter. As I hear, I judge, and My
judgment is righteous, because I do not seek My own desire, but the desire of
the Father who sent Me. 
John
5:31  “If I bear witness of Myself, My
witness is not true. 
John
5:32  “There is another who bears witness
of Me, and I know that the witness which He witnesses of Me is true. 
John
5:33  “You have sent to Yoḥanan,
and he bore witness to the truth. 
John
5:34  “But I do not receive witness from
man, but I say this in order that you might be saved. 
John
5:35  “He was the burning and shining
lamp, and for a while you wished to rejoice in his light. 
John
5:36  “But I have a greater witness than
that of Yoḥanan, for the works that the Father gave Me to accomplish, the
works that I do, bear witness of Me, that the Father has sent Me. 
John
5:37  “And the Father who sent Me, He
bore witness of Me. You have neither heard His voice at any time, nor seen His
form.
John
5:38  “And you do not have His Word
staying in you, because you do not believe Him whom He sent. 
John
5:39  “You search the Scriptures, because
you think you possess everlasting life in them. And these are the ones that
bear witness of Me. 
John
5:40  “But you do not desire to come to
Me in order to possess life. 
John
5:41  “I do not receive esteem from men, 
John
5:42  but I know you, that you do not
have the love of Elohim in you. 
John
5:43  “I have come in My Father’s Name
and you do not receive Me, if another comes in his own name, him you would
receive.
John
5:44  “How are you able to believe, when
you are receiving esteem from one another, and the esteem that is from the only
Elohim you do not seek? 
John
5:45  “Do not think that I shall accuse
you to the Father. There is one who accuses you: Mosheh, in whom you have set
your expectation. 
John
5:46  “For if you believed Mosheh, you
would have believed Me, since he wrote about Me. 
John
5:47  “But if you do not believe his
writings, how shall you believe My words?”
John
6:1  After this יהושע
went away to the other side of the Sea of Galil, that is Lake Kinnereth. 
John
6:2  And a large crowd was following Him,
because they saw His signs which He did on those who were sick. 
John
6:3  And יהושע
went up on a mountain, and there He sat down with His taught ones. 
John
6:4  And the Passover was near, the
festival of the Yehuḏim. 
John
6:5  Then יהושע,
lifting up His eyes and seeing a large crowd coming toward Him, said to Philip,
“Where shall we buy bread for them to eat?” 
John
6:6  And this He said, trying him, for He
Himself knew what He would do. 
John
6:7  Philip answered Him, “Two hundred
pieces of silver worth of bread is not sufficient for them, for every one of
them to receive a little.” 
John
6:8  One of His taught ones, Andri, the
brother of Shim‛on Kĕpha, said to Him, 
John
6:9  “Here is a boy who has five barley
loaves and two fishes, but what are these for so many?” 
John
6:10  And יהושע
said, “Make the people sit down.” Now there was much grass in the place, and
the men, numbering about five thousand, sat down. 
John
6:11  And יהושע
took the loaves, and having given thanks He distributed them to the taught
ones, and the taught ones to those sitting down. And the same with the fish, as
much as they wished. 
John
6:12  And when they were filled, He said
to His taught ones, “Gather the broken pieces that are left over, so that none
gets wasted.” 
John
6:13  So they gathered them and filled
twelve baskets with broken pieces of the five barley loaves which were left
over by those who had eaten. 
John
6:14  Then the men, having seen the sign
that יהושע did, said, “This is truly the Prophet
who is coming to the world.” 
John
6:15  Then יהושע,
knowing that they were about to come and seize Him, that they might make Him
sovereign, withdrew again to the mountain, alone by Himself. 
John
6:16  And when evening came, His taught
ones went down to the sea, 
John
6:17  and entering into the boat, they
were going over the sea toward Kephar Naḥum. And it had already become
dark, and יהושע had not yet come to them. 
John
6:18  And the sea was rising because a
great wind was blowing. 
John
6:19  When they had rowed about five or
six kilometres, they saw יהושע walking on the sea
and coming near the boat, and they were afraid. 
John
6:20  And He said to them, “It is I, do
not be afraid.” 
John
6:21  They wished therefore to take Him
into the boat, and at once the boat was at the land where they were going. 
John
6:22  On the next day, the crowd that was
standing on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there
except that one into which His taught ones had entered, and that יהושע
had not entered the boat with His taught ones, but His taught ones went away
alone – 
John
6:23  but other boats came from
Kinnereth, near the place where they ate bread after the Master had given
thanks – 
John
6:24  therefore when the crowd saw that יהושע
was not there, nor His taught ones, they themselves also entered into the boats
and came to Kephar Naḥum, seeking יהושע. 
John
6:25  And having found Him on the other
side of the sea, they asked Him, “Rabbi, when did You come here?” 
John
6:26  יהושע
answered them and said, “Truly, truly, I say to you, you seek Me, not because
you saw signs, but because you ate of the loaves and were satisfied. 
John
6:27  “Do not labour for the food that is
perishing, but for the food that is remaining to everlasting life, which the
Son of Aḏam shall give you, for the Father, Elohim, has set His seal on
Him.”
John
6:28  So they said to Him, “What should
we do to work the works of Elohim?” 
John
6:29  יהושע
answered and said to them, “This is the work of Elohim, that you believe in Him
whom He sent.” 
John
6:30  So they said to Him, “What sign
then would You do, so that we see and believe You? What would You do? 
John
6:31  “Our fathers ate the manna in the
wilderness, as it has been written, ‘He gave them bread out of the heaven to
eat.’ ” 
John
6:32  Therefore יהושע
said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, Mosheh did not give you the bread
out of the heaven, but My Father gives you the true bread out of the heaven. 
John
6:33  “For the bread of Elohim is He who
comes down out of the heaven and gives life to the world.” 
John
6:34  So they said to Him, “Master, give
us this bread always.” 
John
6:35  And יהושע
said to them, “I am the bread of life. He who comes to Me shall not get hungry
at all, and he who believes in Me shall not get thirsty at all. 
John
6:36  “But I said to you that you have
seen Me, and still do not believe. 
John
6:37  “All that the Father gives Me shall
come to Me, and the one who comes to Me I shall by no means cast out. 
John
6:38  “Because I have come down out of
the heaven, not to do My own desire, but the desire of Him who sent Me. 
John
6:39  “This is the desire of the Father
who sent Me, that all He has given Me I should not lose of it, but should raise
it in the last day. 
John
6:40  “And this is the desire of Him who
sent Me, that everyone who sees the Son and believes in Him should possess
everlasting life. And I shall raise him up in the last day.” 
John
6:41  Therefore the Yehuḏim were
grumbling against Him, because He said, “I am the bread which came down out of
the heaven.” 
John
6:42  And they said, “Is not this יהושע,
the son of Yosĕph, whose father and mother we know? How is it then that He
says, ‘I have come down out of the heaven’?” 
John
6:43  Then יהושע
answered and said to them, “Do not grumble with one another. 
John
6:44  “No one is able to come to Me
unless the Father who sent Me draws him. And I shall raise him up in the last
day. 
John
6:45  “It has been written in the
prophets, ‘And they shall all be taught by יהוה.’
Everyone, then, who has heard from the Father, and learned, comes to Me. 
John
6:46  “Not that anyone has seen the
Father, except He who is from Elohim – He has seen the Father. 
John
6:47  “Truly, truly, I say to you, he who
believes in Me possesses everlasting life. 
John
6:48  “I am the bread of life. 
John
6:49  “Your fathers ate the manna in the
wilderness and they died. 
John
6:50  “This is the bread which comes down
out of the heaven, so that anyone might eat of it, and not die. 
John
6:51  “I am the living bread which came
down out of the heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he shall live forever.
And indeed, the bread that I shall give is My flesh, which I shall give for the
life of the world.” 
John
6:52  The Yehuḏim, therefore, were
striving with one another, saying, “How is this One able to give us His flesh to eat?” 
John
6:53  יהושע
therefore said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh
of the Son of Aḏam and drink His blood, you possess no life in
yourselves. 
John
6:54  “He who eats My flesh and drinks My
blood possesses everlasting life, and I shall raise him up in the last day. 
John
6:55  “For My flesh is truly food, and My
blood is truly drink. 
John
6:56  “He who eats My flesh and drinks My
blood stays in Me, and I in him. 
John
6:57  “As the living Father sent Me, and
I live because of the Father, so he who feeds on Me shall live because of Me. 
John
6:58  “This is the bread which came down
out of the heaven, not as your fathers ate the manna and died. He who eats this
bread shall live forever.” 
John
6:59  He said this in a congregation,
teaching in Kephar Naḥum. 
John
6:60  Therefore many of His taught ones
having heard, said, “This word is hard, who is able to hear it?” 
John
6:61  But יהושע
knowing within Himself that His taught ones were grumbling about this, said to
them, “Does this make you stumble? 
John
6:62  “What if you see the Son of Aḏam
going up where He was before? 
John
6:63  “It is the Spirit that gives life,
the flesh does not profit at all. The words that I speak to you are Spirit and
are life.
John
6:64  “But there are some of you who do
not believe.” For יהושע knew from the beginning
who they were who did not believe, and who would deliver Him up. 
John
6:65  And He said, “Because of this I
have said to you that no one is able to come to Me unless it has been given to
him by My Father.” 
John
6:66  From then on many of His taught
ones withdrew and were not walking with Him any more. 
John
6:67  יהושע
therefore said to the twelve, “Do you also wish to go away?” 
John
6:68  Then Shim‛on Kĕpha
answered Him, “Master, to whom shall we go? You possess words of everlasting
life. 
John
6:69  “And we have believed, and we know
that You are the Messiah, the Son of the living Elohim.” 
John
6:70  יהושע
answered them, “Have I not chosen you, the twelve, and one of you is a devil?” 
John
6:71  He was now speaking of Yehuḏah
from Qerioth, the son of Shim‛on,
for he, one of the twelve, was about to deliver Him up. 
John
7:1  And after this יהושע
was walking in Galil, for He did not wish to walk in Yehuḏah, because the
Yehuḏim were seeking to kill Him. 
John
7:2  And the festival of the Yehuḏim
was near, the Festival of Booths. 
John
7:3  So His brothers said to Him, ‘Get
away from here and go into Yehuḏah, so that Your taught ones also see the
works that You are doing. 
John
7:4  “For no one acts in secret while he
himself seeks to be known openly. If You do these works, show Yourself to the world.” 
John
7:5  For even His brothers did not
believe in Him. 
John
7:6  יהושע
therefore said to them, “My time has not yet come, but your time is always
ready. 
John
7:7  “It is impossible for the world to
hate you, but it hates Me because I bear witness of it, that its works are
wicked. 
John
7:8  “You go up to this festival. I am
not yet going up to this festival, for My time has not yet been filled.” 
John
7:9  And having said this to them, He
stayed in Galil. 
John
7:10  But when His brothers had gone up
to the festival, then He also went up, not openly, but as it were in secret. 
John
7:11  The Yehuḏim, therefore, were
seeking Him at the festival, and said, “Where is He?” 
John
7:12  And there was much grumbling about
Him among the crowd. Some were saying, “He is good,” but others were saying, “No,
but He is leading the crowd astray.” 
John
7:13  However, no one spoke openly of Him
for fear of the Yehuḏim. 
John
7:14  And about the middle of the
festival יהושע went up into the Set-apart Place,
and He was teaching. 
John
7:15  And the Yehuḏim were
marvelling, saying, “How does this Man know letters, not having learned?” 
John
7:16  יהושע
answered them and said, “My teaching is not Mine, but His who sent Me.
John
7:17  “If anyone desires to do His
desire, he shall know concerning the teaching, whether it is from Elohim, or whether I speak from Myself. 
John
7:18  “He who speaks from himself is
seeking his own esteem, but He who seeks the esteem of the One who sent Him is
true, and no unrighteousness is in Him. 
John
7:19  “Did not Mosheh give you the Torah?
Yet not one of you does the Torah! Why do you seek to kill Me?”
John
7:20  The crowd answered and said, “You
have a demon, who seeks to kill You?” 
John
7:21  יהושע
answered and said to them, “I did one work, and you all marvel. 
John
7:22  “Because of this Mosheh has given
you the circumcision – though it is not from Mosheh, but from the fathers – and
you circumcise a man on the Sabbath. 
John
7:23  “If a man receives circumcision on
the Sabbath, so that the Torah of Mosheh should not be broken, are you wroth
with Me because I made a man entirely well on the Sabbath? 
John
7:24  “Do not judge according to
appearance, but judge with righteous judgment.” 
John
7:25  Therefore some of them from
Yerushalayim said, “Is this not He whom they are seeking to kill? 
John
7:26  “And see! He speaks boldly, and
they say none at all to Him. Could it be that the rulers truly know that this
is truly the Messiah? 
John
7:27  “But we know where this One is
from. And when the Messiah comes, no one knows where He is from.” 
John
7:28  יהושע
therefore cried out in the Set-apart Place, teaching and saying, “You both know
Me, and you know where I am from. And I have not come of Myself, but He who
sent Me is true, whom you do not know. 
John
7:29  “But I know Him, because I am from
Him, and He sent Me.” 
John
7:30  So they were seeking to seize Him,
but no one laid a hand on Him, because His hour had not yet come. 
John
7:31  And many of the crowd believed in
Him, and said, “When the Messiah comes, shall He do more signs than these which
this One did?” 
John
7:32  The Pharisees heard the crowd
muttering these matters concerning
Him, and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to seize Him. 
John
7:33  Therefore יהושע
said to them, “Yet a little while I am with you, then I go to Him who sent Me. 
John
7:34  “You shall seek Me and you shall
not find Me, and where I am you are
unable to come.” 
John
7:35  The Yehuḏim, therefore, said
to themselves, “Where is He about to go that we shall not find Him? Is He about
to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks, and to teach the Greeks? 
John
7:36  “What is this word which He said, ‘You
shall seek Me and you shall not find Me,
and where I am you are unable to come’?” 
John
7:37  And on the last day, the great day of the festival, יהושע
stood and cried out, saying, “If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me, and let
him who believes in Me drink. 
John
7:38  “As the Scripture said, out of His
innermost shall flow rivers of living water.”
John
7:39  And this He said concerning the
Spirit, which those believing in Him were about to receive, for the Set-apart
Spirit was not yet given, because יהושע
was not yet esteemed.
John
7:40  Many from the crowd, when they
heard the word, then said, “This truly is the Prophet.” 
John
7:41  Others said, “This is the Messiah,”
but others said, “Does the Messiah then come out of Galil? 
John
7:42  “Did not the Scripture say that the
Messiah comes from the seed of Dawiḏ and from the village of Bĕyth
Leḥem, where Dawiḏ was?” 
John
7:43  So a division came about among the
people because of Him. 
John
7:44  And some of them wished to take
Him, but no one laid hands on Him. 
John
7:45  The officers therefore came to the
chief priests and Pharisees. And they said to them, “Why did you not bring Him?”

John
7:46  The officers answered, “Never has
any man spoken like this Man!” 
John
7:47  The Pharisees, therefore, answered
them, “Have you also been led astray? 
John
7:48  “Has anyone of the rulers or of the
Pharisees believed in Him? 
John
7:49  “But this crowd that does not know
the Torah is accursed.” 
John
7:50  Naḵdimon – he who came to יהושע
by night, being one of them – said to them, 
John
7:51  “Does our Torah judge the man
unless it hears first from him and knows what he is doing?” 
John
7:52  They answered and said to him, “Are
you also from Galil? Search and see that no prophet has arisen out of Galil.” 
John
7:53  And each one went to his own house.

John
8:1  And יהושע
went to the Mount of Olives. 
John
8:2  And at dawn He came again into the
Set-apart Place, and all the people were coming to Him. And having sat down, He
was teaching them. 
John
8:3  And the scribes and Pharisees
brought to Him a woman caught in adultery. And having set her in the midst, 
John
8:4  they said to Him, “Teacher, this
woman was caught in the act of adultery. 
John
8:5  “And in the Torah Mosheh commanded
us that such should be stoned. What then do You say?” 
John
8:6  And this they said, trying Him, so
that they might accuse Him. But יהושע, bending
down, wrote on the ground with the finger, as though He did not hear. 
John
8:7  But as they kept on questioning Him,
He straightened up and said to them, “He who is without sin among you, let him
be the first to throw a stone at her.” 
John
8:8  And bending down again, He wrote on
the ground. 
John
8:9  And when they heard it, being
reproved by their conscience, went
out one by one, beginning from the older ones until the last. And יהושע
was left alone, and the woman standing in the middle. 
John
8:10  And יהושע,
straightening up and seeing no one but the woman, said to her, “Woman, where
are those accusers of yours? Did no one condemn you?” 
John
8:11  And she said, “No one, Master.” And
יהושע said to her, “Neither do I condemn you. Go
and sin no more.”
John
8:12  Therefore יהושע
spoke to them again, saying, “I am the light of the world. He who follows Me
shall by no means walk in darkness, but possess the light of life.”
John
8:13  The Pharisees, therefore, said to
Him, “You bear witness about Yourself, Your witness is not true.” 
John
8:14  יהושע
answered and said to them, “Even if I witness concerning Myself, My witness is
true, for I know where I came from and where I am going. But you do not know
from where I come, or where I go. 
John
8:15  “You judge according to the flesh,
I judge no one. 
John
8:16  “But even if I do judge, My
judgment is true, because I am not alone in
it, but I and the Father who sent Me. 
John
8:17  “And in your Torah also, it has
been written that the witness of two men is true. 
John
8:18  “I am One who witnesses concerning
Myself, and the Father who sent Me witnesses concerning Me.” 
John
8:19  Therefore they said to Him, “Where
is Your Father?” יהושע answered, “You know
neither Me nor My Father. If you knew Me, you would have known My Father also.”

John
8:20  These words יהושע
spoke in the treasury, teaching in the Set-apart Place. And no one laid hands
on Him, because His hour had not yet come. 
John
8:21  Therefore יהושע
said to them again, “I am going away, and you shall seek Me, and you shall die
in your sin. Where I go you are unable to come.” 
John
8:22  Then the Yehuḏim said, “Shall
He kill Himself, because He says, ‘Where I go you are unable to come’?” 
John
8:23  And He said to them, “You are from
below, I am from above. You are of this world, I am not of this world. 
John
8:24  “Therefore I said to you that you
shall die in your sins. For if you do not believe that I am He, you shall die
in your sins.” 
John
8:25  Then they said to Him, “Who are
You?” And יהושע said to them, “Altogether that
which I even say to you! 
John
8:26  “I have much to say and to judge
concerning you. But He who sent Me is true, and what I heard from Him, these Words I speak to the world.” 
John
8:27  They did not know that He spoke to
them of the Father. 
John
8:28  So יהושע
said to them, “When you lift up the Son of Aḏam, then you shall know that
I am He, and that I do none at all of Myself, but as My Father taught Me, these
words I speak. 
John
8:29  “And He who sent Me is with Me. The
Father has not left Me alone, for I always do what pleases Him.” 
John
8:30  As He was speaking these words,
many believed in Him. 
John
8:31  So יהושע
said to those Yehuḏim who believed Him, “If you stay in My Word, you are
truly My taught ones, 
John
8:32  and you shall know the truth, and
the truth shall make you free.” 
John
8:33  They answered Him, “We are the seed
of Aḇraham, and have been servants to no one at any time. How do you say,
‘You shall become free’?” 
John
8:34  יהושע
answered them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone doing sin is a servant of
sin. 
John
8:35  “And the servant does not stay in
the house forever – a son stays forever. 
John
8:36  “If, then, the Son makes you free,
you shall be free indeed. 
John
8:37  “I know that you are the seed of Aḇraham,
but you seek to kill Me, because My word has no place in you. 
John
8:38  “I speak what I have seen with My
Father, and you do what you have heard from your father.” 
John
8:39  They answered and said to Him, “Aḇraham
is our father.” יהושע said to them, “If you were
Aḇraham’s children, you would do the works of Aḇraham.
John
8:40  “But now you seek to kill Me, a Man
who has spoken to you the truth which I heard from Elohim. Aḇraham did
not do this. 
John
8:41  “You do the works of your father.”
Then they said to Him, “We were not born of whoring, we have one Father:
Elohim.” 
John
8:42  יהושע
said to them, “If Elohim were your Father, you would love Me, for I came forth
from Elohim, and am here. For I have not come of Myself, but He sent Me. 
John
8:43  “Why do you not know what I say?
Because you are unable to hear My Word. 
John
8:44  “You are of your father the devil, and the desires of your father you wish to
do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and has not stood in the truth,
because there is no truth in him. When he speaks the lie, he speaks of his own,
for he is a liar and the father of it. 
John
8:45  “And because I speak the truth, you
do not believe Me. 
John
8:46  “Who of you proves Me wrong
concerning sin? And if I speak the truth, why do you not believe Me? 
John
8:47  “He who is of Elohim hears the
Words of Elohim, therefore you do not hear because you are not of Elohim.” 
John
8:48  The Yehuḏim answered and said
to Him, “Do we not say well that You are a Shomeronite and have a demon?” 
John
8:49  יהושע
answered, “I do not have a demon, but I value My Father, and you do not value
Me. 
John
8:50  “And I do not seek My own esteem,
there is One who is seeking and is judging. 
John
8:51  “Truly, truly, I say to you, if
anyone guards My Word he shall never see death at all.” 
John
8:52  The Yehuḏim said to Him, “Now
we know that You have a demon! Aḇraham died, and the prophets. And You
say, ‘If anyone guards My Word he shall never taste death at all.’ 
John
8:53  “Are You greater than our father Aḇraham,
who died? And the prophets died. Whom do You make Yourself?” 
John
8:54  יהושע
answered, “If I esteem Myself, My esteem is none at all. It is My Father who
esteems Me, of whom you say that He is your Elohim. 
John
8:55  “And you have not known Him, but I
know Him. And if I say, ‘I do not know Him,’ I shall be like you, a liar. But I
do know Him and I guard His Word.
John
8:56  “Your father Aḇraham was glad
that he should see My day, and he saw it and did rejoice.” 
John
8:57  The Yehuḏim, therefore, said
to Him, “You are not yet fifty years old, and have You seen Aḇraham?” 
John
8:58  יהושע
said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, before Aḇraham came to be, I
am.”
John
8:59  Therefore they picked up stones to
throw at Him, but יהושע was hidden and went out
of the Set-apart Place, going through the midst of them, and so passed by. 
John
9:1  And passing by, He saw a man, blind
from birth. 
John
9:2  And His taught ones asked Him,
saying, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he should be born
blind?” 
John
9:3  יהושע
answered, “Neither this man nor his parents sinned, but that the works of
Elohim might be made manifest in him. 
John
9:4  “It is necessary for Me to work the
works of Him who sent Me while it is day – night is coming, when no one is able
to work. 
John
9:5  “While I am in the world, I am the
light of the world.” 
John
9:6  Having said this, He spat on the
ground and made clay with the saliva, and applied the clay to the eyes of the
blind man. 
John
9:7  And He said to him, “Go, wash in the
pool of Shiloaḥ” (which means Sent). So he went and washed, and came
seeing. 
John
9:8  Therefore the neighbours and those
who saw him before, that he was blind, said, “Is not this he who was sitting
and begging?” 
John
9:9  Others said, “This is he.” Others said, “He is like him.” He said, “I am.”

John
9:10  So they said to him, “How were your
eyes opened?” 
John
9:11  He answered and said, “A Man called
יהושע made clay and applied it to my eyes and
said to me, ‘Go to the pool of Shiloaḥ and wash.’ And I went and washed,
and I received sight.” 
John
9:12  And they said to him, “Where is He?”
He said, “I do not know.” 
John
9:13  They brought to the Pharisees the
one who was once blind. 
John
9:14  Now it was a Sabbath when יהושע
made the clay and opened his eyes. 
John
9:15  Therefore the Pharisees also asked
him again how he had received his sight. He said to them, “He put clay on my
eyes, and I washed, and I see.” 
John
9:16  Therefore some of the Pharisees
said, “This Man is not from Elohim, because He does not guard the Sabbath.”
Others said, “How is a man who is a sinner able to do such miracles?” And there
was a division among them. 
John
9:17  So they said to the blind one
again, “What do you say about Him because He opened your eyes?” And he said, “He
is a prophet.” 
John
9:18  However, the Yehuḏim did not
believe concerning him, that he had been blind and received his sight, till
they called the parents of him who had received his sight. 
John
9:19  And they asked them, saying, “Is
this your son, who you say was born blind? How then does he now see?” 
John
9:20  His parents answered them and said,
“We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind, 
John
9:21  but how he now sees we do not know,
or who opened his eyes we do not know. He is of age, ask him, he shall speak
concerning himself.” 
John
9:22  His parents said this because they
were afraid of the Yehuḏim, for the Yehuḏim had already agreed that
if anyone confessed that He was Messiah, he should be put out of the
congregation. 
John
9:23  Because of this his parents said, “He
is of age, ask him.” 
John
9:24  So for the second time they called
the man who was blind, and said to him, “Give esteem to Elohim, we know that
this Man is a sinner.” 
John
9:25  Then he answered and said, “Whether
He is a sinner, I do not know. I only know that I was blind, now I see.” 
John
9:26  And they asked him once more, “What
did He do to you? How did He open your eyes?” 
John
9:27  He answered them, “I have told you
already, and you did not hear. Why do you wish to hear it again? Do you wish to
become His taught ones too?” 
John
9:28  Then they abused him and said, “You
are His taught one, but we are taught ones of Mosheh. 
John
9:29  “We know that Elohim has spoken to
Mosheh, but this One, we do not know where He is from.” 
John
9:30  The man answered and said to them, “Why,
this is a wonder! You do not know where He is from, yet He opened my eyes! 
John
9:31  “And we know that Elohim does not
hear sinners. But if anyone fears Elohim and does His desire, He hears him. 
John
9:32  “From of old it has never been
heard that anyone opened the eyes of one who was born blind. 
John
9:33  “If this One were not from Elohim,
He could have done none at all.” 
John
9:34  They answered and said to him, “You
were completely born in sins – and are you teaching us?” And they cast him out.

John
9:35  יהושע
heard that they had cast him out, and when He had found him, He said to him, “Do
you believe in the Son of Elohim?” 
John
9:36  He answered and said, “Who is He,
Master, that I might believe in Him?” 
John
9:37  And יהושע
said to him, “You have both seen Him and He who speaks with you is He.” 
John
9:38  And he said, “Master, I believe,”
and bowed before Him. 
John
9:39  And יהושע
said, “For judgment I have come into this world, that those not seeing might
see, and those seeing might become blind.” 
John
9:40  And those of the Pharisees who were
with Him heard these words, and said to Him, “Are we blind, too?” 
John
9:41  יהושע
said to them, “If you were blind, you would have no sin, but now you say, ‘We
see,’ therefore your sin remains. 
John
10:1  “Truly, truly, I say to you, he who
does not enter through the door into the sheepfold, but climbs up by another
way, that one is a thief and a robber. 
John
10:2  “But he who enters through the door
is the shepherd of the sheep. 
John
10:3  “The doorkeeper opens for him, and
the sheep hear his voice. And he calls his own sheep by name and leads them
out. 
John
10:4  “And when he has brought out his
own sheep, he goes before them. And the sheep follow him, because they know his
voice. 
John
10:5  “And they shall by no means follow
a stranger, but shall flee from him, because they do not know the voice of
strangers.” 
John
10:6  יהושע
used this figure of speech, but they did not know what He had been saying to
them. 
John
10:7  יהושע
therefore said to them again, “Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the
sheep. 
John
10:8  “All who came before Me are thieves
and robbers, but the sheep did not hear them. 
John
10:9  “I am the door. Whoever enters
through Me, he shall be saved, and shall go in and shall go out and find
pasture. 
John
10:10  “The thief does not come except to
steal, and to slaughter, and to destroy. I have come that they might possess
life, and that they might possess it beyond measure. 
John
10:11  “I am the good shepherd. The good
shepherd lays down His life for the sheep. 
John
10:12  “But the hireling, and not being a
shepherd, one who does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the
sheep and flees. And the wolf snatches the sheep and scatters them. 
John
10:13  “Now the hireling flees because he
is a hireling and is not concerned about the sheep. 
John
10:14  “I am the good shepherd. And I
know Mine, and Mine know Me,
John
10:15  even as the Father knows Me, and I
know the Father. And I lay down My life for the sheep. 
John
10:16  “And other sheep I have which are
not of this fold – I have to bring them as well, and they shall hear My voice,
and there shall be one flock, one shepherd.
John
10:17  “Because of this the Father loves
Me, because I lay down My life, in order to receive it again. 
John
10:18  “No one takes it from Me, but I
lay it down of Myself. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to
receive it again. This command I have received from My Father.” 
John
10:19  Again there came a division among
the Yehuḏim because of these words, 
John
10:20  and many of them said, “He has a
demon and is mad, why do you listen to Him?” 
John
10:21  Others said, “These are not the
words of one possessed by a demon. Is a demon able to open the eyes of the
blind?” 
John
10:22  At that time the Ḥanukkah
came to be in Yerushalayim, and it was winter. 
John
10:23  And יהושע
was walking in the Set-apart Place, in the porch of Shelomoh. 
John
10:24  So the Yehuḏim surrounded
Him and said to Him, “How long do You keep us in suspense? If You are the
Messiah, say to us plainly.” 
John
10:25  יהושע
answered them, “I have told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in
My Father’s Name, they bear witness concerning Me. 
John
10:26  “But you do not believe, because
you are not of My sheep, as I said to you. 
John
10:27  “My sheep hear My voice, and I
know them, and they follow Me.
John
10:28  “And I give them everlasting life,
and they shall by no means ever perish, and no one shall snatch them out of My
hand. 
John
10:29  “My Father, who has given them to
Me, is greater than all. And no one is able to snatch them out of My Father’s
hand. 
John
10:30  “I and My Father are one.”
John
10:31  Again the Yehuḏim picked up
stones to stone Him. 
John
10:32  יהושע
answered them, “Many good works I have shown you from My Father. Because of
which of these works do you stone Me?” 
John
10:33  The Yehuḏim answered Him,
saying, “We do not stone You for a good work, but for blasphemy, and because
You, being a Man, make Yourself Elohim.” 
John
10:34  יהושע
answered them, “Is it not written in your own Torah, ‘I said, “You are elohim” ’?

John
10:35  “If He called them elohim, to whom
the word of Elohim came – and it is impossible for the Scripture to be broken –

John
10:36  do you say of Him whom the Father
set apart and sent into the world, ‘You are blaspheming,’ because I said, ‘I am
the Son of Elohim’? 
John
10:37  “If I do not do the works of My
Father, do not believe Me; 
John
10:38  but if I do, though you do not
believe Me, believe the works, so that you know and believe that the Father is
in Me, and I in Him.” 
John
10:39  Therefore they were seeking again
to seize Him, but He went forth out of their hand, 
John
10:40  and went once more to the other
side of the Yardĕn to the place where Yoḥanan was immersing at
first, and there He stayed. 
John
10:41  And many came to Him and said, “Yoḥanan
indeed did no sign, yet all that Yoḥanan said about this Man was true.”
John
10:42  And many believed in Him there. 
John
11:1  And a certain one was sick, El‛azar
from Bĕyth Anyah, the village of Miryam and her sister Martha. 
John
11:2  (Now it was Miryam who anointed the
Master with perfume and wiped His feet with her hair, whose brother El‛azar
was sick). 
John
11:3  Therefore the sisters sent to Him,
saying, “Master, see, he whom You love is sick.” 
John
11:4  But when יהושע
heard, He said, “This sickness is not unto death, but for the esteem of Elohim,
so that the Son of Elohim might be esteemed by it.” 
John
11:5  Now יהושע
loved Martha and her sister and El‛azar . 
John
11:6  Therefore, when He heard that he
was sick, then indeed He stayed at the place where He was, two more days. 
John
11:7  Then after this He said to the taught
ones, “Let us go back to Yehuḏah.” 
John
11:8  The taught ones said to Him, “Rabbi,
the Yehuḏim were but now seeking to stone You, and are You going back
there?” 
John
11:9  יהושע
answered, “Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks in the day,
he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world. 
John
11:10  “But if anyone walks in the night,
he stumbles, because the light is not in him.” 
John
11:11  He said this, and after that He
said to them, “Our friend El‛azar has fallen asleep, but I am going
there, to wake him up.” 
John
11:12  Therefore the taught ones said to
Him, “Master, if he has fallen asleep he shall recover.” 
John
11:13  But יהושע
had spoken about his death, whereas they thought that He spoke of taking rest
in sleep. 
John
11:14  So then יהושע
said to them plainly, “El‛azar has died. 
John
11:15  “And for your sake I am glad I was
not there, in order for you to believe. But let us go to him.” 
John
11:16  T’oma, who is called the Twin,
then said to his fellow taught ones, “Let us also go, so that we die with Him.”

John
11:17  Therefore, when יהושע
arrived, He found that he had already been four days in the tomb. 
John
11:18  Now Bĕyth Anyah was near
Yerushalayim, about three kilometres away. 
John
11:19  And many of the Yehuḏim had
come to Martha and Miryam, to comfort them concerning their brother. 
John
11:20  Martha, then, when she heard that יהושע
was coming, met Him, but Miryam was sitting in the house. 
John
11:21  Martha, then, said to יהושע,
“Master, if You had been here, my brother would not have died. 
John
11:22  “But even now I know that whatever
You might ask of Elohim, Elohim shall give You.” 
John
11:23  יהושע
said to her, “Your brother shall rise again.” 
John
11:24  Martha said to Him, “I know that
he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.” 
John
11:25  יהושע
said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in Me, though
he dies, he shall live. 
John
11:26  “And everyone that is living and
believing in Me shall never die at all. Do you believe this?” 
John
11:27  She said to Him, “Yea, Master, I
believe that You are the Messiah, the Son of Elohim, who is coming into the
world.” 
John
11:28  And having said this she went away
and called her sister Miryam secretly, saying, “The Teacher is here and calls
you.” 
John
11:29  When she heard, she rose up
quickly and came to Him. 
John
11:30  And יהושע
had not yet come into the village, but was in the place where Martha met Him. 
John
11:31  Therefore the Yehuḏim who
were with her in the house, and were comforting her, when they saw that Miryam
rose up quickly and went out, followed her, saying, “She is going to the tomb
to weep there.” 
John
11:32  Miryam, therefore, when she came
where יהושע was, and saw Him, she fell down at
His feet, saying to Him, “Master, if You had been here, my brother would not
have died.” 
John
11:33  יהושע,
therefore, when He saw her weeping, and the Yehuḏim who came with her
weeping, He groaned in the spirit and was troubled, 
John
11:34  and said, “Where have you laid
him?” They said to Him, “Master, come and see.” 
John
11:35  יהושע
wept. 
John
11:36  The Yehuḏim therefore said, “See
how He loved him!” 
John
11:37  And some of them said, “Was this
One, who opened the eyes of the blind, not also able to prevent this one from
dying?” 
John
11:38  יהושע,
therefore, again groaning in Himself, came to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and
a stone lay against it. 
John
11:39  יהושע
said, “Take away the stone.” Martha, the sister of him who had died, said to
Him, “Master, already he smells, for it is four days.” 
John
11:40  יהושע
said to her, “Did I not say to you that if you believe, you shall see the
esteem of Elohim?” 
John
11:41  So they took away the stone where
the dead man was laid. And יהושע lifted up His
eyes and said, “Father, I thank You that You have heard Me. 
John
11:42  “And I know that You always hear
Me, but because of the crowd standing by I said this, in order that they
believe that You sent Me.” 
John
11:43  And when He had said this, He
cried with a loud voice, “El‛azar, come out!” 
John
11:44  And he who died came out bound
feet and hands with wrappings, and his face was wrapped with a cloth. יהושע
said to them, “Loosen him, and let him go.” 
John
11:45  Therefore many of the Yehuḏim
who had come to Miryam, and had seen what יהושע
did, believed in Him. 
John
11:46  But some of them went away to the
Pharisees and told them what יהושע did. 
John
11:47  So the chief priests and the
Pharisees gathered a council and said, “What shall we do? Because this Man does
many signs. 
John
11:48  “If we let Him alone like this,
they all shall believe in Him, and the Romans shall come and take away from us
both our place and nation.” 
John
11:49  And one of them, Qayapha, being
high priest that year, said to them, “You know naught, 
John
11:50  neither do you consider that it is
better for us that one man die for the people than that the entire nation
should perish.” 
John
11:51  But he did not say this from
himself, but being high priest that year he prophesied that יהושע
was about to die for the nation, 
John
11:52  and not for the nation only, but
to gather together into one the children of Elohim who were scattered abroad. 
John
11:53  So from that day on they plotted
to kill Him. 
John
11:54  יהושע
therefore no longer went openly among the Yehuḏim, but went from there
into the country near the wilderness, to a city called Ephrayim, and remained
there with His taught ones. 
John
11:55  Now the Passover of the Yehuḏim
was near, and many went from the country up to Yerushalayim before the
Passover, to set themselves apart. 
John
11:56  And so they were seeking יהושע,
and spoke among one another, standing in the Set-apart Place, “What do you
think? Is He not coming to the festival at all?” 
John
11:57  And both the chief priests and the
Pharisees had given a command, that if anyone knew where He was, he should
disclose it, in order for them to seize Him. 
John
12:1  Accordingly יהושע,
six days before the Passover, came to Bĕyth Anyah, where El‛azar
was, who had died, whom He raised from the dead. 
John
12:2  So they made Him a supper there,
and Martha served, while El‛azar was one of those who sat at the table
with Him. 
John
12:3  Then Miryam took a pound of costly
perfume of nard, anointed the feet of יהושע, and
wiped His feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the fragrance of
the perfume. 
John
12:4  Then one of His taught ones, Yehuḏah
from Qerioth, son of Shim‛on,
who was about to deliver Him up, said, 
John
12:5  “Why was this perfume not sold for
three hundred pieces of silver and given to the poor?” 
John
12:6  And he said this, not because he
was concerned about the poor, but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and
he used to take what was put in it. 
John
12:7  יהושע
then said, “Let her alone, she has kept this for the day of My burial. 
John
12:8  “For the poor you have with you
always, but Me you do not have always.” 
John
12:9  Then a great crowd of the Yehuḏim
learned that He was there. And they came, not on account of יהושע
only, but also to see El‛azar, whom He had raised from the dead. 
John
12:10  And the chief priests resolved to
kill El‛azar as well, 
John
12:11  because on account of him many of
the Yehuḏim went away and believed in יהושע.

John
12:12  On the next day a great crowd who
had come to the festival, when they heard that יהושע
was coming to Yerushalayim, 
John
12:13  took the branches of palm trees
and went out to meet Him, and were crying out, “Hoshia-na! Blessed is He who is
coming in the Name of יהוה, the Sovereign of Yisra’ĕl!”
John
12:14  And יהושע,
having found a young donkey, sat on it, as it has been written: 
John
12:15  “Do not fear, daughter of Tsiyon,
see, your Sovereign is coming, sitting on the colt of a donkey.” 
John
12:16  At first His taught ones did not
understand this. But when יהושע was esteemed,
then they remembered that this was written about Him and that they had done
this to Him. 
John
12:17  Therefore the crowd, who were with
Him when He called El‛azar out of his tomb and raised him from the dead,
were bearing witness. 
John
12:18  On account of this the crowd also
met Him, because they heard that He had done this sign. 
John
12:19  The Pharisees then said among
themselves, “You see how you are getting nowhere at all. Look, the world has
gone after Him!” 
John
12:20  And there were certain Greeks
among those coming up to worship at the festival. 
John
12:21  These then came to Philip, who was
from Bĕyth Tsaiḏa of Galil, and were asking him, saying, “Master, we
wish to see יהושע.” 
John
12:22  Philip came and told Andri, and in
turn Andri and Philip told יהושע. 
John
12:23  And יהושע
answered them, saying, “The hour has come for the Son of Aḏam to be
esteemed. 
John
12:24  “Truly, truly, I say to you,
unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone. But
if it dies, it bears much fruit. 
John
12:25  “He who loves his life shall lose
it, and he who hates his life in this world shall preserve it for everlasting
life. 
John
12:26  “If anyone serves Me, let him
follow Me. And where I am, there My servant also shall be. If anyone serves Me,
the Father shall value him. 
John
12:27  “Now I Myself am troubled, and
what shall I say? ‘Father, save Me from this hour’? But for this reason I came
to this hour. 
John
12:28  “Father, esteem Your Name.” Then a
voice came from the heaven, “I have both esteemed it and shall esteem it again.”

John
12:29  So the crowd who stood by and
heard it were saying there had been thunder. Others said, “A messenger has
spoken to Him.” 
John
12:30  יהושע
answered and said, “This voice did not come because of Me, but for your sake. 
John
12:31  “Now is the judgment of this
world, now the ruler of this world shall be cast out.
John
12:32  “And I, if I am lifted up from the
earth, shall draw all men unto
Myself.” 
John
12:33  This He said, signifying by what
death He was about to die. 
John
12:34  The crowd answered Him, “We have
heard out of the Torah that the Messiah remains forever. And how do You say, ‘The
Son of Aḏam has to be lifted up’? Who is this Son of Aḏam?” 
John
12:35  יהושע,
therefore, said to them, “Yet a little while the light is with you. Walk while
you have the light, lest darkness overtake you. And he who walks in darkness
does not know where he is going. 
John
12:36  “While you have the light, believe
in the light, so that you become sons of light.” These words יהושע spoke, and went off and
was hidden from them. 
John
12:37  But though He had done so many
signs before them, they did not believe in Him, 
John
12:38  that the word of Yeshayahu the
prophet might be filled, which he spoke, “ יהוה, who
has believed our report? And to whom has the arm of יהוה
been revealed?” 
John
12:39  Because of this they were unable
to believe, because again Yeshayahu said: 
John
12:40  “He has blinded their eyes and
hardened their heart, so that they should not see with their eyes and
understand with their heart, and turn, and I should heal them.”
John
12:41  Yeshayahu said this when he saw
His esteem and spoke of Him. 
John
12:42  Still, even among the rulers many
did believe in Him, but because of the Pharisees they did not confess Him, lest they should be put out of the
congregation, 
John
12:43  for they loved the praise of men
more than the praise of Elohim. 
John
12:44  Then יהושע
cried out and said, “He who believes in Me, believes not in Me but in Him who
sent Me. 
John
12:45  “And he who sees Me sees Him who
sent Me. 
John
12:46  “I have come as a light into the
world, so that no one who believes in Me should stay in darkness. 
John
12:47  “And if anyone hears My Words but
does not watch over them, I do not judge him. For I did not come to judge the
world but to save the world. 
John
12:48  “He who rejects Me, and does not
receive My Words, has one who judges him: the Word that I have spoken shall
judge him in the last day.
John
12:49  “Because I spoke not from Myself,
but the Father who sent Me has given Me a command, what I should say and what I
should speak.
John
12:50  “And I know that His command is
everlasting life. Therefore, whatever I speak, as the Father has said to Me, so
I speak.”
John
13:1  And before the Festival of the
Passover, יהושע knowing that His hour had come
that He should move out of this world unto the Father, having loved His own who
were in the world, He loved them to the end. 
John
13:2  And supper taking place, the devil
having already put it into the heart of Yehuḏah from Qerioth, son of Shim‛on, to deliver Him up,

John
13:3  יהושע,
knowing that the Father had given all into His hands, and that He had come from
Elohim and was going to Elohim, 
John
13:4  rose from supper and laid aside His
garments, and having taken a towel, He girded Himself. 
John
13:5  After that He put water into a
basin and began to wash the feet of the taught ones, and to wipe them with the
towel with which He was girded. 
John
13:6  And so He came to Shim‛on Kĕpha,
and he said to Him, “Master, do You wash my feet?” 
John
13:7  יהושע
answered and said to him, “You do not know what I am doing now, but you shall
know after this.” 
John
13:8  Kĕpha said to Him, “By no
means shall You wash my feet, ever!” יהושע
answered him, “If I do not wash you, you have no part with Me.” 
John
13:9  Shim‛on Kĕpha said to
Him, “Master, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head!” 
John
13:10  יהושע
said to him, “He who has had a bath does not need to wash, except his feet, but
is clean altogether. And you are clean, but not all of you.” 
John
13:11  For He knew who would deliver Him
up, so He said, “You are not all clean.” 
John
13:12  So when He had washed their feet
and taken His garments, and sat down again, He said to them, “Do you know what
I have done to you? 
John
13:13  “You call me Teacher and Master,
and you say well, for I am. 
John
13:14  “Then if I, Master and Teacher,
have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet. 
John
13:15  “For I gave you an example, that
you should do as I have done to you. 
John
13:16  “Truly, truly, I say to you, a
servant is not greater than his master, nor is an emissary greater than he who
sent him. 
John
13:17  “If you know these teachings, blessed are you if you do
them. 
John
13:18  “I do not speak concerning all of
you. I know whom I have chosen, but that the Scripture might be filled, ‘He who
eats bread with Me has lifted up his heel against Me.’ 
John
13:19  “Now I say to you, before it takes
place, that when it does take place, you shall believe that I am. 
John
13:20  “Truly, truly, I say to you, he
who receives whomever I send, receives Me. And he who receives Me, receives Him
who sent Me.” 
John
13:21  When יהושע
had said this He was troubled in spirit, and witnessed and said, “Truly, truly,
I say to you, one of you shall deliver Me up.” 
John
13:22  The taught ones looked at one
another, doubting of whom He spoke. 
John
13:23  And one of His taught ones, whom יהושע
loved, was reclining on the bosom of יהושע. 
John
13:24  Shim‛on Kĕpha then
motioned to him to ask who it was of whom He spoke. 
John
13:25  And leaning back on the breast of יהושע
he said to Him, “Master, who is it?” 
John
13:26  יהושע
answered, “It is he to whom I shall give a piece of bread when I have dipped
it.” And having dipped the bread, He gave it to Yehuḏah from Qerioth, son of Shim‛on. 
John
13:27  And after the piece of bread,
Satan entered into him. יהושע, therefore, said to
him, “What you do, do quickly.” 
John
13:28  But no one at the table knew why
He said this to him, 
John
13:29  for some were supposing, because
Yehuḏah had the bag, that יהושע was saying
to him, “Buy what we need for the festival,” or that he should give somewhat to
the poor. 
John
13:30  So, having received the piece of
bread, he then went out straightaway, and it was night. 
John
13:31  When, therefore, he went out, יהושע
said, “Now the Son of Aḏam has been esteemed, and Elohim has been
esteemed in Him. 
John
13:32  “If Elohim has been esteemed in
Him, Elohim shall also esteem Him in Himself, and straightaway esteem Him. 
John
13:33  “Little children, yet a little
while I am with you. You shall seek Me, and as I said to the Yehuḏim, ‘Where
I am going, you are unable to come,’ I now also say to you. 
John
13:34  “A renewed command I give to you,
that you love one another, as I have loved you, that you also love one another.

John
13:35  “By this shall all know that you
are My taught ones, if you have love for one another.” 
John
13:36  Shim‛on Kĕpha said to
Him, “Master, where are You going?” יהושע
answered him, “Where I am going you are unable to follow Me now, but afterwards
you shall follow Me.” 
John
13:37  Kĕpha said to Him, “Master,
why am I unable to follow You now? I shall lay down my life for You.” 
John
13:38  יהושע
answered him, “Shall you lay down your life for Me? Truly, truly, I say to you,
the cock shall not crow at all until you have denied Me three times. 
John
14:1  “Let not your heart be troubled.
Believe in Elohim, believe also in Me. 
John
14:2  “In My Father’s house are many
staying places. And if not, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for
you. 
John
14:3  “And if I go and prepare a place
for you, I shall come again and receive you to Myself, that where I am, you
might be too. 
John
14:4  “And where I go you know, and the
way you know.” 
John
14:5  T’oma said to Him, “Master, we do
not know where You are going, and how are we able to know the way?” 
John
14:6  יהושע
said to him, “I am the Way, and the Truth, and the Life. No one comes to the
Father except through Me. 
John
14:7  “If you had known Me, you would
have known My Father too. From now on you know Him, and have seen.” 
John
14:8  Philip said to Him, “Master, show
us the Father, and it is enough for us.” 
John
14:9  יהושע
said to him, “Have I been with you so long, and you have not known Me, Philip?
He who has seen Me has seen the Father, and how do you say, ‘Show us the Father’?

John
14:10  “Do you not believe that I am in
the Father, and the Father is in Me? The words that I speak to you I do not
speak from Myself. But the Father who stays in Me does His works. 
John
14:11  “Believe Me that I am in the
Father and the Father in Me, otherwise believe Me because of the works
themselves. 
John
14:12  “Truly, truly, I say to you, he
who believes in Me, the works that I do he shall do also. And greater works than these he shall do, because I
go to My Father. 
John
14:13  “And whatever you ask in My Name,
that I shall do, in order that the Father might be esteemed in the Son. 
John
14:14  “If you ask whatever in My Name, I
shall do it. 
John
14:15  “If you love Me, you shall guard
My commands.
John
14:16  “And I shall ask the Father, and
He shall give you another Helper, to stay with you forever – 
John
14:17  the Spirit of the Truth, whom the
world is unable to receive, because it does not see Him or know Him. But you
know Him, for He stays with you and shall be in you. 
John
14:18  “I shall not leave you orphans – I
am coming to you. 
John
14:19  “Yet a little while, and the world
no longer sees Me, but you shall see Me, because I live, and you shall live. 
John
14:20  “In that day you shall know that I
am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you. 
John
14:21  “He who possesses My commands and
guards them, it is he who loves Me. And he who loves Me shall be loved by My
Father, and I shall love him and manifest Myself to him.” 
John
14:22  Yehuḏah – not the one from
Qerioth – said to Him, “Master, what has come about that You are about to
manifest Yourself to us, and not to the world?” 
John
14:23  יהושע
answered him, “If anyone loves Me, he shall guard My Word. And My Father shall
love him, and We shall come to him and make Our stay with him. 
John
14:24  “He who does not love Me does not
guard My Words. And the Word which you hear is not Mine but of the Father Who
sent Me. 
John
14:25  “These Words I have spoken to you while still with you. 
John
14:26  “But the Helper, the Set-apart
Spirit, whom the Father shall send in My Name, He shall teach you all, and
remind you of all that I said to you. 
John
14:27  “Peace I leave with you – My peace
I give to you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your heart
be troubled, neither let it be afraid. 
John
14:28  “You heard that I said to you, ‘I
am going away and I am coming to you.’ If you did love Me, you would have
rejoiced that I said, ‘I am going to the Father,’ for My Father is greater than
I. 
John
14:29  “And now I have told you before it
takes place, that when it does take place, you shall believe. 
John
14:30  “I shall no longer talk much with
you, for the ruler of this world is coming, and he possesses none at all in Me,
John
14:31  but, in order for the world to know
that I love the Father, and that as the Father commanded Me, so I am doing.
Rise up, let us go from here. 
John
15:1  “I am the true vine, and My Father
is the gardener. 
John
15:2  “Every branch in Me that bears no
fruit He takes away. And every branch that bears fruit He prunes, so that it
bears more fruit. 
John
15:3  “You are already clean because of
the Word which I have spoken to you. 
John
15:4  “Stay in Me, and I stay in you. As the branch is unable to
bear fruit of itself, unless it stays in the vine, so neither you, unless you
stay in Me. 
John
15:5  “I am the vine, you are the
branches. He who stays in Me, and I in him, he bears much fruit. Because
without Me you are able to do naught! 
John
15:6  “If anyone does not stay in Me, he
is thrown away as a branch and dries up. And they gather them and throw them
into the fire, and they are burned. 
John
15:7  “If you stay in Me, and My Words
stay in you, you shall ask whatever you wish, and it shall be done for you. 
John
15:8  “In this My Father is esteemed,
that you bear much fruit, and you shall be My taught ones. 
John
15:9  “As the Father has loved Me, I have
also loved you. Stay in My love. 
John
15:10  “If you guard My commands, you
shall stay in My love, even as I have guarded My Father’s commands and stay in
His love.
John
15:11  “These words I have spoken to you, so that My joy might be in you, and
that your joy might be complete. 
John
15:12  “This is My command, that you love
one another, as I have loved you.
John
15:13  “No one has greater love than
this: that one should lay down his life for his friends. 
John
15:14  “You are My friends if you do
whatever I command you. 
John
15:15  “No longer do I call you servants,
for a servant does not know what his master is doing. But I have called you
friends, for all teachings which I
heard from My Father I have made known to you. 
John
15:16  “You did not choose Me, but I
chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit, and that your
fruit should remain, so that whatever you ask the Father in My Name He might
give you. 
John
15:17  “These words I command you, so that you love one another.
John
15:18  “If the world hates you, you know
that it hated Me before it hated you.

John
15:19  “If you were of the world, the
world would love its own. But because you are not of the world, but I chose you
out of the world, for that reason the world hates you. 
John
15:20  “Remember the word that I said to
you, ‘A servant is not greater than his master.’ If they persecuted Me, they
shall persecute you too. If they have guarded My Word, they would guard yours
too. 
John
15:21  “But all this they shall do to you
because of My Name, because they do not know Him who sent Me. 
John
15:22  “If I had not come and spoken to
them, they would have no sin, but now they have no excuse for their sin. 
John
15:23  “He who hates Me hates My Father
as well. 
John
15:24  “If I did not do among them the
works which no one else did, they would have no sin. But now they have both
seen and have hated both Me and My Father, 
John
15:25  but...that the word might be
filled which was written in their Torah, ‘They hated Me without a cause.’ 
John
15:26  “And when the Helper comes, whom I
shall send to you from the Father, the Spirit of the Truth, who comes from the
Father, He shall bear witness of Me, 
John
15:27  but you also bear witness, because
you have been with Me from the beginning. 
John
16:1  “These words I have spoken to you, so that you do not stumble. 
John
16:2  “They shall put you out of the
congregations, but an hour is coming when everyone who kills you shall think he
is rendering service to Elohim. 
John
16:3  “And this they shall do to you
because they did not know the Father, nor Me. 
John
16:4  “But I have said these words to you, so that when the hour
comes you remember that I told them to you. And these words I did not say to you at the beginning, for I was with you. 
John
16:5  “But now I go away to Him who sent
Me, and not one of you asks Me, ‘Where are You going?’ 
John
16:6  “But because I have said these words to you, grief has filled your
heart. 
John
16:7  “But I say the truth to you. It is
better for you that I go away, for if I do not go away, the Helper shall not
come to you at all, but if I go, I shall send Him to you. 
John
16:8  “And having come, He shall reprove
the world concerning sin, and concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment
–
John
16:9  concerning sin because they do not
believe in Me, 
John
16:10  concerning righteousness because I
go to My Father and you see Me no more, 
John
16:11  concerning judgment because the
ruler of this world is judged.
John
16:12  “I still have many words to say to you, but you are not
able to bear them now. 
John
16:13  “But when He comes, the Spirit of
the Truth, He shall guide you into all the truth. For He shall not speak from
Himself, but whatever He hears He shall speak, and He shall announce to you
what is to come. 
John
16:14  “He shall esteem Me, for He shall
take of what is Mine and announce it to you. 
John
16:15  “All that the Father has is Mine.
That is why I said that He takes from what is Mine and announces it to you. 
John
16:16  “A little while, and you do not
see Me, and again a little while, and you shall see Me.” 
John
16:17  Therefore some of His taught ones
said to one another, “What is this that He says to us, ‘A little while, and you
do not see Me, and again a little while, and you shall see Me,’ and, ‘because I
am going to the Father’?” 
John
16:18  So they said, “What is this that
He says, ‘A little while’? We do not know what He is saying.” 
John
16:19  יהושע,
therefore, knew that they were wishing to ask Him, and He said to them, “Are
you asking one another about what I said, ‘A little while, and you do not see
Me, and again a little while, and you shall see Me’? 
John
16:20  “Truly, truly, I say to you that
you shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice. And you shall be
grieved, but your grief shall become joy. 
John
16:21  “The woman has grief when she is
in labour, because her hour has come, but as soon as she has given birth to the
child, she no longer remembers the affliction, for joy that a man was born into
the world. 
John
16:22  “And you, therefore, have grief
now, but I shall see you again and your heart shall rejoice, and no one takes
your joy away from you. 
John
16:23  “And in that day you shall ask Me
none at all. Truly, truly, I say to you, whatever you ask the Father in My Name
He shall give you. 
John
16:24  “Until now you have asked naught
in My Name. Ask, and you shall receive, in order that your joy might be
complete. 
John
16:25  “These words I have spoken to you in figures of speech, but an hour is
coming when I shall no longer speak to you in figures of speech, but I shall
declare the Father plainly to you. 
John
16:26  “In that day you shall ask in My
Name, and I do not say to you that I shall pray the Father on your behalf, 
John
16:27  for the Father Himself does love
you, because you have loved Me, and have believed that I came forth from
Elohim. 
John
16:28  “I came forth from the Father and
have come into the world. Again, I leave the world and go to the Father.” 
John
16:29  His taught ones said to Him, “See,
now You are speaking plainly, and not using figure of speech! 
John
16:30  “Now we know that You know all,
and have no need that anyone should question You. By this we believe that You
came forth from Elohim.” 
John
16:31  יהושע
answered them, “Do you now believe? 
John
16:32  “See, an hour is coming, and has
now come, that you are scattered, each to his own, and leave Me alone. Yet I am
not alone, because the Father is with Me. 
John
16:33  “These words I have spoken to you, that in Me you might have peace. In the
world you have pressure, but take courage, I have overcome the world.” 
John
17:1  יהושע
said these words, and lifted up His
eyes to the heaven, and said, “Father, the hour has come. Esteem Your Son, so
that Your Son also might esteem You, 
John
17:2  as You have given Him authority
over all flesh, that He should give everlasting life to all whom You have given
Him. 
John
17:3  “And this is everlasting life, that
they should know You, the only true Elohim, and יהושע
Messiah whom You have sent. 
John
17:4  “I have esteemed You on the earth,
having accomplished the work You have given Me that I should do. 
John
17:5  “And now, esteem Me with Yourself,
Father, with the esteem which I had with You before the world was. 
John
17:6  “I have revealed Your Name to the
men whom You gave Me out of the world. They were Yours, and You gave them to
Me, and they have guarded Your Word.
John
17:7  “Now they have come to know that
all You gave to Me, is from You. 
John
17:8  “Because the Words which You gave
to Me, I have given to them. And they have received them, and have truly known
that I came forth from You, and they believed that You sent Me. 
John
17:9  “I pray for them. I do not pray for
the world but for those whom You have given Me, for they are Yours. 
John
17:10  “And all Mine are Yours, and Yours
are Mine, and I have been esteemed in them. 
John
17:11  “And I am no more in the world,
but these are in the world, and I come to You. Set-apart Father, guard them in
Your Name which You have given Me, so that they might be one, as We are.
John
17:12  “When I was with them in the
world, I was guarding them in Your Name which You have given Me, and I watched
over them, and not one of them perished except the son of destruction, that the
Scripture might be filled. 
John
17:13  “And now I come to You. And I
speak these words in the world, so
that they have My joy completed in them. 
John
17:14  “I have given them Your Word, and
the world hated them because they are not of the world, as I am not of the
world. 
John
17:15  “I do not pray that You should
take them out of the world, but that You keep them from the wicked one. 
John
17:16  “They are not of the world, as I
am not of the world. 
John
17:17  “Set them apart in Your truth –
Your Word is truth.
John
17:18  “As You sent Me into the world, I
also sent them into the world. 
John
17:19  “And for them I set Myself apart,
so that they too might be set apart in truth. 
John
17:20  “And I do not pray for these
alone, but also for those believing in Me through their word, 
John
17:21  so that they all might be one, as
You, Father, are in Me, and I in You, so that they too might be one in Us, so
that the world might believe that You have sent Me. 
John
17:22  “And the esteem which You gave Me
I have given them, so that they might be one as We are one, 
John
17:23  “I in them, and You in Me, so that
they might be perfected into one, so that the world knows that You have sent
Me, and have loved them as You have loved Me. 
John
17:24  “Father, I desire that those whom
You have given Me, might be with Me where I am, so that they see My esteem
which You have given Me, because You loved Me before the foundation of the
world. 
John
17:25  “O righteous Father, indeed the
world did not know You, but I knew You, and these knew that You sent Me. 
John
17:26  “And I have made Your Name known
to them, and shall make it known, so that the love with which You loved Me
might be in them, and I in them.”
John
18:1  Having said these words, יהושע
went out with His taught ones beyond the Qiḏron torrent, where there was
a garden, into which He and His taught ones entered. 
John
18:2  And Yehuḏah, who delivered
Him up, also knew the place, because יהושע often
met there with His taught ones. 
John
18:3  Yehuḏah, then, having
received the company of soldiers, and
officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, came there with lanterns, and
torches, and weapons. 
John
18:4  יהושע,
then, knowing all that would come upon Him, went forward and said to them, “Whom
do you seek?” 
John
18:5  They answered Him, “ יהושע
of Natsareth.” יהושע said to them, “I am.” And
Yehuḏah, who delivered Him up, was also standing with them. 
John
18:6  When, therefore, He said to them, “I
am,” they drew back and fell to the ground. 
John
18:7  Once more He asked them, “Whom do
you seek?” And they said, “ יהושע of Natsareth.” 
John
18:8  יהושע
answered, “I said to you that I am. If, then, you seek Me, allow these to go,” 
John
18:9  in order that the word might be
filled which He spoke, “Of those whom You have given Me, I have lost none.” 
John
18:10  Then Shim‛on Kĕpha,
having a sword, drew it and struck the high priest’s servant, and cut off his
right ear. And the servant’s name was Meleḵ. 
John
18:11  Then יהושע
said to Kĕpha, “Put your sword into the sheath. Shall I not drink the cup
which My Father has given Me?” 
John
18:12  Then the company of soldiers and the commander and the
officers of the Yehuḏim seized יהושע and
bound Him, 
John
18:13  and they led Him away to Ḥanan
first, for he was the father-in-law of Qayapha who was high priest that year. 
John
18:14  Now Qayapha was the one who gave
counsel to the Yehuḏim that it was better that one man should die for the
people. 
John
18:15  And Shim‛on Kĕpha
followed יהושע, with another taught one, and that
taught one was known to the high priest, and went with יהושע
into the courtyard of the high priest. 
John
18:16  But Kĕpha was standing
outside at the door. So the other taught one, who was known to the high priest,
went out and spoke to her who kept the door, and brought Kĕpha in. 
John
18:17  Then the servant girl who kept the
door said to Kĕpha, “Are you also one of this Man’s taught ones?” He said,
“I am not.” 
John
18:18  And the servants and officers who
had made a fire of coals stood there, because it was cold, and they warmed themselves.
And Kĕpha was standing with them and warming himself. 
John
18:19  Then the high priest asked יהושע
about His taught ones and His teaching. 
John
18:20  יהושע
answered him, “I spoke openly to the world. I always taught in the congregation
and in the Set-apart Place, where the Yehuḏim always meet, and I spoke no
word in secret. 
John
18:21  “Why do you ask Me? Ask those who
have heard Me what I said to them. See, they know what I said.” 
John
18:22  And when He had said this, one of
the officers who stood by slapped יהושע in the
face, saying, “Do You answer the high priest this way?” 
John
18:23  יהושע
answered him, “If I have spoken evilly, bear witness of the evil, but if well,
why do you strike Me?” 
John
18:24  Then Ḥanan sent Him bound to
the high priest, Qayapha. 
John
18:25  And Shim‛on Kĕpha was
standing and warming himself. Then they said to him, “Are you also one of His
taught ones?” He denied it and said, “I am not!” 
John
18:26  One of the servants of the high
priest, a relative of the one whose ear Kĕpha cut off, said, “Did I not
see you in the garden with Him?” 
John
18:27  Then Kĕpha again denied it,
and immediately a cock crowed. 
John
18:28  Then they led יהושע
from Qayapha to the palace, and it was early. And they themselves did not go
into the palace, lest they should be defiled, but that they might eat the
Passover. 
John
18:29  Pilate, therefore, came out to
them and said, “What accusation do you bring against this Man?” 
John
18:30  They answered and said to him, “If
He were not an evil-doer, we would not have delivered Him up to you.” 
John
18:31  Then Pilate said to them, “You
take Him and judge Him according to your law.” The Yehuḏim said to him, “It
is not right for us to put anyone to death,” 
John
18:32  in order that the word of יהושע
might be filled which He spoke, signifying by what death He was about to die. 
John
18:33  Then Pilate went back into the
palace, and called יהושע, and said to Him, “Are
You the Sovereign of the Yehuḏim?” 
John
18:34  יהושע
answered him, “Do you say this from yourself, or did others talk to you about
Me?” 
John
18:35  Pilate answered, “Am I a Yehuḏite?
Your own nation and the chief priests have delivered You to me. What did You
do?” 
John
18:36  יהושע
answered, “My reign is not of this world. If My reign were of this world, My
servants would fight, so that I should not be delivered to the Yehuḏim.
But now My reign is not from here.” 
John
18:37  Then Pilate said to Him, “You are
a sovereign, then?” יהושע answered, “You say it,
because I am a sovereign. For this I was born, and for this I have come into
the world, that I should bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the
truth hears My voice.” 
John
18:38  Pilate said to Him, “What is
truth?” And when he had said this, he went out again to the Yehuḏim, and
said to them, “I find no guilt in Him. 
John
18:39  “But you have a habit that I shall
release someone to you at the Passover. Do you wish, then, that I release to
you the Sovereign of the Yehuḏim?” 
John
18:40  Then they all shouted again,
saying, “Not this One, but Barabba!” And Barabba was a robber. 
John
19:1  Then, therefore, Pilate took יהושע
and flogged Him. 
John
19:2  And the soldiers plaited a crown of
thorns and placed it on His head, and they put a purple robe on Him, 
John
19:3  and came to Him and said, “Greetings,
Sovereign of the Yehuḏim!” And they slapped Him in the face. 
John
19:4  And Pilate went outside again, and
said to them, “See, I am bringing Him out to you, to let you know that I find
no guilt in Him.” 
John
19:5  Then יהושע
came outside, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. And Pilate said
to them, “See the Man!” 
John
19:6  So when the chief priests and
officers saw Him, they shouted, saying, “Impale! Impale!” Pilate said to them, “You
take Him and impale Him, for I find no guilt in Him.” 
John
19:7  The Yehuḏim answered him, “We
have a law, and according to our law He ought to die, for He has made Himself
the Son of Elohim.” 
John
19:8  So when Pilate heard this word, he was
more afraid, 
John
19:9  and went back into the palace, and
asked יהושע, “Where are You from?” But יהושע
gave him no answer. 
John
19:10  Then Pilate said to Him, “Do You
not speak to me? Do You not know that I possess authority to impale You, and I
possess authority to release You?” 
John
19:11  יהושע
answered, “You would possess no authority against Me if it were not given you
from above. Because of this, he who delivered Me to you has greater sin.” 
John
19:12  From then on Pilate was seeking to
release Him, but the Yehuḏim shouted, saying, “If you release this One,
you are not Caesar’s friend. Everyone who makes himself a sovereign, does speak
against Caesar.” 
John
19:13  Therefore, when Pilate heard these
words, he brought יהושע out and sat down in the
judgment seat in a place that is called Pavement, but in Heḇrew,
Gabbatha. 
John
19:14  And it was the Preparation Day of the Passover week, and about the sixth hour. And he said to the Yehuḏim, “See
your Sovereign!” 
John
19:15  But they shouted, “Away, away,
impale Him!” Pilate said to them, “Shall I impale your Sovereign?” The chief
priests answered, “We have no sovereign except Caesar!” 
John
19:16  At that time, then, he delivered
Him to them to be impaled. And they took יהושע
and led Him away. 
John
19:17  And bearing His stake, He went out
to the so-called Place of a Skull, which is called in Heḇrew, Golgotha, 
John
19:18  where they impaled Him, and two
others with Him, one on this side and one on that side, and יהושע
in the middle. 
John
19:19  And Pilate wrote a title too, and
put it on the stake, and it was written: יהושע OF
NATSARETH, THE SOVEREIGN OF THE YEHUḎIM.
John
19:20  Many of the Yehuḏim
therefore read this title, for the place where יהושע
was impaled was near the city, and it was written in Heḇrew, in Greek, in
Roman. 
John
19:21  So the chief priests of the Yehuḏim
said to Pilate, “Do not write, ‘The Sovereign of the Yehuḏim,’ but, ‘He
said, “I am the Sovereign of the Yehuḏim.” ’ ” 
John
19:22  Pilate answered, “What I have
written, I have written.” 
John
19:23  Then the soldiers, when they had
impaled יהושע, took His outer garments and made
four parts, to each soldier a part, and the inner garment. But the inner
garment was without seam, woven from the top in one piece. 
John
19:24  So they said to each other, “Let
us not tear it, but cast lots for it – whose it shall be,” in order that the
Scripture might be filled which says, “They divided My garments among them, and
for My clothing they cast lots.” The soldiers therefore indeed did this. 
John
19:25  And by the stake of יהושע
stood His mother, and His mother’s sister, Miryam the wife of Qlophah, and
Miryam from Maḡdala. 
John
19:26  Then יהושע,
seeing His mother and the taught one whom He loved standing by, He said to His
mother, “Woman, see your son!” 
John
19:27  Then to the taught one He said, “See,
your mother!” And from that hour that taught one took her to his own home. 
John
19:28  After this, יהושע,
knowing that all had been accomplished, in order that the Scripture might be
accomplished, said, “I thirst!” 
John
19:29  A bowl of sour wine stood there,
and they filled a sponge with sour wine, put it on hyssop, and held it to His
mouth. 
John
19:30  So when יהושע
took the sour wine He said, “It has been accomplished!” And bowing His head, He
gave up His spirit. 
John
19:31  Therefore, since it was the
Preparation Day, that the bodies
should not remain on the stake on the Sabbath – for that Sabbath was a high one
– the Yehuḏim asked Pilate to have their legs broken, and that they be taken away. 
John
19:32  Therefore the soldiers came and
broke the legs of the first, and of the other who was impaled with Him, 
John
19:33  but when they came to יהושע
and saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs. 
John
19:34  But one of the soldiers pierced
His side with a spear, and instantly blood and water came out. 
John
19:35  And he who has seen has witnessed,
and his witness is true. And he knows that he is speaking the truth, in order
that you might believe. 
John
19:36  For this took place in order for
the Scripture to be filled: “Not one of His bones shall be broken.” 
John
19:37  And again another Scripture says, “They
shall look on Him whom they pierced.” 
John
19:38  And after this, Yosĕph of
Ramathayim, being a taught one of יהושע, but
secretly, for fear of the Yehuḏim, asked Pilate that he might take the
body of יהושע, and Pilate gave permission.
Therefore he came and took the body of יהושע. 
John
19:39  And Naḵdimon, who at first
came to יהושע by night, also came, bringing a
mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds. 
John
19:40  Then they took the body of יהושע,
and bound it in linen wrappings with the spices, as was the habit of the Yehuḏim
for burial. 
John
19:41  And at the place where He was
impaled there was a garden, and in the garden a fresh tomb in which no one had
yet been laid. 
John
19:42  There, then, because of the
Preparation Day of the Yehuḏim,
they laid יהושע, because the tomb was near. 
John
20:1  And on the first day of the week
Miryam from Maḡdala came early to the tomb, while it was still dark, and
saw that the stone had been removed from the tomb.
John
20:2  So she ran and came to Shim‛on
Kĕpha, and to the other taught one whom יהושע
loved, and said to them, “They have taken the Master out of the tomb, and we do
not know where they laid Him.” 
John
20:3  Then Kĕpha and the other
taught one went out, and they were going to the tomb, 
John
20:4  and the two were running together,
but the other taught one outran Kĕpha and came to the tomb first. 
John
20:5  And stooping down he saw the linen
wrappings lying, but he did not go in. 
John
20:6  Then Shim‛on Kĕpha came,
following him, and went into the tomb. And he saw the linen wrappings lying, 
John
20:7  and the cloth which had been on His
head, not lying with the linen wrappings, but folded up in a place by itself. 
John
20:8  So, then, the other taught one, who
came to the tomb first, also went in. And he saw and believed. 
John
20:9  For they did not yet know the
Scripture, that He has to rise again from the dead. 
John
20:10  Therefore the taught ones went
away again, by themselves. 
John
20:11  But Miryam was standing outside by
the tomb weeping. Then as she wept, she stooped down to the tomb, 
John
20:12  and saw two messengers in white
sitting, one at the head and the other at the feet, where the body of יהושע
had been laid. 
John
20:13  And they said to her, “Woman, why
do you weep?” She said to them, “Because they took away my Master, and I do not
know where they laid Him.” 
John
20:14  And having said this, she turned
around and saw יהושע standing, but she did not
know that it was יהושע. 
John
20:15  יהושע
said to her, “Woman, why do you weep? Whom do you seek?” Thinking He was the
gardener, she said to Him, “Master, if You have carried Him away, say to me
where You put Him, and I shall take Him away.” 
John
20:16  יהושע
said to her, “Miryam!” She turned and said to Him, “Rabboni!” (which means
Teacher). 
John
20:17  יהושע
said to her, “Do not hold on to Me, for I have not yet ascended to My Father.
But go to My brothers and say to them, ‘I am ascending to My Father and your
Father, and to My Elohim and your Elohim.’ ” 
John
20:18  Miryam from Maḡdala came
announcing to the taught ones that she had seen the Master, and that He had
told her this. 
John
20:19  When therefore it was evening on
that day, the first day of the week,and when the doors were shut where the
taught ones met, for fear of the Yehuḏim, יהושע
came and stood in the midst, and said to them, “Peace to you.” 
John
20:20  And having said this, He showed
them His hands and His side. The taught ones therefore rejoiced when they saw
the Master. 
John
20:21  Then יהושע
said to them again, “Peace to you! As the Father has sent Me, I also send you.”

John
20:22  And having said this, He breathed
on them, and said to them, “Receive the Set-apart Spirit. 
John
20:23  “If you forgive the sins of any,
they are forgiven them; if you retain the sins of any, they have been retained.”

John
20:24  But T’oma, called the Twin, one of
the twelve, was not with them when יהושע came, 
John
20:25  so the other taught ones said to
him, “We have seen the Master.” But he said to them, “Unless I see in His hands
the mark of the nails, and put my finger into the imprint of the nails, and put
my hand into His side, I shall by no means believe.” 
John
20:26  And after eight days His taught
ones were again inside, and T’oma with them. יהושע
came, the doors having been shut, and He stood in the midst, and said, “Peace
to you!” 
John
20:27  Then He said to T’oma, “Bring your
finger here, and see My hands. And bring your hand and put it into My side –
and do not be unbelieving, but believing.” 
John
20:28  And T’oma answered and said to
Him, “My Master and my Elohim!”
John
20:29  יהושע
said to him, “T’oma, because you have seen Me, you have believed. Blessed are
those who have not seen and have believed.” 
John
20:30  There were indeed many other signs
that יהושע did in the presence of His taught
ones, which are not written in this book, 
John
20:31  but these have been written so
that you believe that יהושע is the Messiah, the
Son of Elohim, and that, believing, you might possess life in His Name.
John
21:1  After this יהושע
manifested Himself again to the taught ones at the Sea of Kinnereth, and He
manifested this way: 
John
21:2  Shim‛on Kĕpha, and T’oma
called the Twin, and Nethanĕ’l of Qanah in Galil, the sons of Zaḇdai, and two others of His taught ones were
together. 
John
21:3  Shim‛on Kĕpha said to
them, “I am going to fish.” They said to him, “We are also coming with you.”
They went out and immediately entered into the boat. And that night they caught
none at all. 
John
21:4  But when it became early morning, יהושע
stood on the beach. However, the taught ones did not know that it was יהושע.

John
21:5  Then יהושע
said to them, “Children, have you any food?” They answered Him, “No.” 
John
21:6  And He said to them, “Throw the net
on the right side of the boat, and you shall find.” So they threw, and they
were no longer able to draw it in because of the large number of fish. 
John
21:7  That taught one whom יהושע
loved then said to Kĕpha, “It is the Master!” Then Shim‛on Kĕpha,
hearing that it was the Master, put on his outer garment – for he was stripped –
and plunged into the sea. 
John
21:8  And the other taught ones came in
the little boat – for they were not far from land, but about two hundred cubits
– dragging the net with fish. 
John
21:9  So when they had come to land, they
saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid on it, and bread. 
John
21:10  יהושע
said to them, “Bring some of the fish which you have now caught.” 
John
21:11  Shim‛on Kĕpha went up
and dragged the net to land, filled with one hundred and fifty-three big
fishes. And though there were so many, the net was not broken. 
John
21:12  יהושע
said to them, “Come, have breakfast.” And not one of the taught ones had the
courage to ask Him, “Who are You?,” knowing that it was the Master. 
John
21:13  יהושע
came and took the bread and gave it to them, and the same with the fish. 
John
21:14  This was now the third time יהושע
was manifested to His taught ones after He was raised from the dead. 
John
21:15  When, therefore, they had eaten
breakfast, יהושע said to Shim‛on Kĕpha,
“Shim‛on, son of Yonah, do you
love Me more than these?” He said to Him, “Yea, Master, You know that I love
You.” He said to him, “Feed My lambs.” 
John
21:16  He said to him again, the second
time, “Shim‛on, son of Yonah,
do you love Me?” He said to Him, “Yea, Master, You know that I love You.” He
said to him, “Shepherd My sheep.” 
John
21:17  He said to him the third time, “Shim‛on,
son of Yonah, do you love Me?” Kĕpha
was sad because He said to him the third time, “Do you love Me?” And he said to
Him, “Master, You know all, You know that I love You.” יהושע
said to him, “Feed My sheep. 
John
21:18  “Truly, truly, I say to you, when
you were younger you girded yourself and walked where you wished, but when you
are old you shall stretch out your hands, and another shall gird you and bring
you where you do not wish.” 
John
21:19  Now this He said, signifying by
what death he would esteem Elohim. And having said this, He said to him, “Follow
Me.” 
John
21:20  And Kĕpha, turning around,
saw the taught one whom יהושע loved following,
who also had leaned on His breast at the supper, and said, “Master, who is the
one who is delivering You up?” 
John
21:21  Seeing him, Kĕpha said to יהושע,
“But Master, what about this one?” 
John
21:22  יהושע
said to him, “If I wish him to remain till I come, what is that to you? You
follow Me.” 
John
21:23  Therefore this word went out among
the brothers that this taught one would not die. However, יהושע
did not say to him that he would not die, but, “If I desire him to remain until
I come, what is it to you?” 
John
21:24  This is the taught one who bears
witness about these matters, and
wrote these matters. And we know that
his witness is true. 
John
21:25  Now there is much else that יהושע
did. If every one of them were written down, I think that the world itself
would not contain the written books. Amĕn.
