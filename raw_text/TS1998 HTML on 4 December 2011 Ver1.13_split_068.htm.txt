Pileymon/Philemon
Philemon
1:1  Sha’ul, a prisoner of Messiah יהושע,
and Timothy the brother, to Philemon our beloved one and fellow worker, 
Philemon
1:2  and Apphia our sister, and Archippos
our fellow soldier, and the assembly at your house: 
Philemon
1:3  Favour to you and peace from Elohim
our Father and the Master יהושע Messiah. 
Philemon
1:4  I always thank my Elohim when I
mention you in my prayers, 
Philemon
1:5  hearing of your love and the belief
which you have toward the Master יהושע and toward
all the set-apart ones, 
Philemon
1:6  so that the sharing of your belief
might become working in the knowledge of all the good which is in you toward
Messiah יהושע. 
Philemon
1:7  For we have much joy and
encouragement in your love, because the tender affections of the set-apart ones
have been refreshed by you, brother. 
Philemon
1:8  Therefore, although I have much
boldness in Messiah to command you what is fitting, 
Philemon
1:9  because of love, I rather appeal –
being such a one as Sha’ul, the aged, and now also a prisoner of יהושע
Messiah – 
Philemon
1:10  I appeal to you for my child
Onesimos, whom I brought forth while in my chains, 
Philemon
1:11  who formerly was of no use to you,
but now is of good use to you and to me, 
Philemon
1:12  whom I sent back to you, and receive
him, that is, my own tender affections, 
Philemon
1:13  whom I wished to keep with me, that
on your behalf he might serve me in my chains for the Good News. 
Philemon
1:14  But without your opinion I wished
to do none at all, so that your good deed should not be by way of necessity,
but voluntary. 
Philemon
1:15  For he parted from you for a while, possibly because of this, so that you might
have him back forever, 
Philemon
1:16  no longer as a slave but more than
a slave, as a beloved brother, especially to me, and how much more to you, both
in the flesh and in the Master. 
Philemon
1:17  So, if you regard me as your
partner, receive him as you would me. 
Philemon
1:18  But if he has wronged you or owes
you whatever, put that on my account. 
Philemon
1:19  I, Sha’ul, wrote with my own hand.
I shall repay – not to mention to you that you indeed owe yourself to me also. 
Philemon
1:20  Yes, brother, let me derive
pleasure from you in the Master, refresh my tender affections in the Master. 
Philemon
1:21  Trusting in your obedience, I wrote
to you, knowing that you shall do even more than I say. 
Philemon
1:22  And at the same time also prepare a
place for me to stay, for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given to
you. 
Philemon
1:23  Epaphras, fellow prisoner of me in
Messiah יהושע, greets you, 
Philemon
1:24  and
Mark, Aristarchos, Demas, Luke, my fellow workers. 
Philemon
1:25  The favour of our Master יהושע
Messiah be with your spirit. Amĕn.
