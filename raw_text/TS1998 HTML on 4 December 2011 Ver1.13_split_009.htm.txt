Num
17:5  “And it shall be that the rod of
the man whom I choose buds, and I shall rid Myself of the grumblings of the
children of Yisra’ĕl, which they grumble against you.” 
Num
17:6  And Mosheh spoke to the children of
Yisra’ĕl, and all their leaders gave him a rod each, for each leader
according to their fathers’ houses, twelve rods. And the rod of Aharon was
among their rods. 
Num
17:7  So Mosheh placed the rods before יהוה
in the Tent of the Witness. 
Num
17:8  And it came to be on the next day
that Mosheh went into the Tent of the Witness and saw that the rod of Aharon,
of the house of Lĕwi, had budded, and brought forth buds, and blossomed
and bore ripe almonds. 
Num
17:9  And Mosheh brought out all the rods
from before יהוה to all the children of Yisra’ĕl.
And they looked, and each man took his rod. 
Num
17:10  And יהוה
said to Mosheh, “Bring Aharon’s rod back before the Witness, to be kept as a
sign against the rebels, so that you put an end to their grumblings against Me,
lest they die.” 
Num
17:11  And Mosheh did as יהוה
had commanded him, so he did. 
Num
17:12  And the children of Yisra’ĕl
spoke to Mosheh, saying, “See, we shall die, we shall perish, we shall all
perish! 
Num
17:13  “Anyone who comes near the
Dwelling Place of יהוה dies. Shall we be consumed – to
die?” 
Num
18:1  And יהוה
said to Aharon, “You and your sons and your father’s house with you are to bear
the crookedness against the set-apart place, and you and your sons with you are
to bear the crookedness against your priesthood. 
Num
18:2  “But bring with you your brothers
of the tribe of Lĕwi too, the tribe of your father to join you and serve
you while you and your sons are with you before the Tent of the Witness. 
Num
18:3  “And they shall guard your charge,
and the duty of all the Tent, but they do not come near the furnishings of the
set-apart place and the altar, lest they die, both they and you. 
Num
18:4  “And they shall be joined with you
and guard the duty to the Tent of Meeting, for all the service of the Tent, but
a stranger does not come near you. 
Num
18:5  “And you shall guard the duty of
the set-apart place and the duty of the altar, so that there be no more wrath
on the children of Yisra’ĕl. 
Num
18:6  “And see, I Myself have taken your
brothers the Lĕwites from the midst of the children of Yisra’ĕl – a
gift to you, given by יהוה, to do the service of the
Tent of Meeting. 
Num
18:7  “But you and your sons with you are
to guard your priesthood for all matters at the altar and behind the veil, and
you shall serve. I have given you the priesthood as a gift for service, but the
stranger who comes near is put to death.” 
Num
18:8  And יהוה
spoke to Aharon, “And see, I Myself have also given you the charge of My
contributions, all the set-apart gifts of the children of Yisra’ĕl. I have
given them to you for the anointing, and to your sons, as a law forever. 
Num
18:9  “This is yours of the most
set-apart gifts, from the fire: all
their offerings, all their grain offerings and all their sin offerings and all
their guilt offerings which they render to Me, are most set-apart for you and
your sons. 
Num
18:10  “Eat it in the most set-apart
place – every male eats it. It is set-apart to you. 
Num
18:11  “This also is yours: the
contribution of their gift, with all the wave offerings of the children of
Yisra’ĕl. I have given them to you, and your sons and daughters with you,
as a law forever. Everyone who is clean in your house eats it. 
Num
18:12  “All the best of the oil, and all
the best of the new wine and the grain – their first-fruits which they give to יהוה
– I have given them to you. 
Num
18:13  “The first-fruits of all that is
in their land, which they bring to יהוה, are yours.
Everyone who is clean in your house eats it.
Num
18:14  “All that is dedicated in Yisra’ĕl
is yours. 
Num
18:15  “Everyone opening a womb of all
flesh, which they bring to יהוה, whether man or beast,
is yours. But the first-born of man you shall certainly ransom, and the
first-born of the unclean beast you ransom. 
Num
18:16  “And ransom their ransomed ones
when one month old, according to your valuation, five sheqels of silver,
according to the sheqel of the set-apart place, which is twenty gĕrahs. 
Num
18:17  “But the first-born of a cow, or
the first-born of a sheep, or the first-born of a goat you do not ransom, they
are set-apart. Sprinkle their blood on the altar, and burn their fat as an
offering made by fire for a sweet fragrance to יהוה. 
Num
18:18  “And their flesh is yours, as the
wave breast and as the right thigh, it is yours. 
Num
18:19  “All the contributions of the
set-apart gifts, which the children
of Yisra’ĕl present to יהוה, I have given to you
and your sons and daughters with you as a law forever. It is a covenant of salt
forever before יהוה with you and your seed with you.” 
Num
18:20  And יהוה
said to Aharon, “You are not to have an inheritance in their land, nor have any
portion in their midst. I am your portion and your inheritance among the
children of Yisra’ĕl. 
Num
18:21  “And see, I have given the
children of Lĕwi all the tithes in Yisra’ĕl as an inheritance in
return for the service which they are serving, the service of the Tent of
Meeting. 
Num
18:22  “And let the children of Yisra’ĕl
no more come near the Tent of Meeting, lest they bear sin and die, 
Num
18:23  because the Lĕwites shall do
the service of the Tent of Meeting, so they themselves bear their crookedness.
A law forever, throughout your generations: that among the children of Yisra’ĕl
they are to have no inheritance, 
Num
18:24  but the tithes of the children of
Yisra’ĕl, which they present as a contribution to יהוה,
I have given to the Lĕwites as an inheritance. That is why I have said to
them, ‘Among the children of Yisra’ĕl they have no inheritance.’ ” 
Num
18:25  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying, 
Num
18:26  “Speak to the Lĕwites and say
to them, ‘When you take from the children of Yisra’ĕl the tithes which I
have given you from them as your inheritance, then you shall present a
contribution of it to יהוה, a tenth of the tithe.
Num
18:27  ‘And your contribution shall be
reckoned to you as grain from the threshing-floor and as filling from the
winepress. 
Num
18:28  ‘Thus you also present a
contribution unto יהוה from all your tithes which you
receive from the children of Yisra’ĕl. And you shall give from it the
contribution to יהוה to Aharon the priest. 
Num
18:29  ‘From all your gifts you present
every contribution due to יהוה, from all the best of them,
the set-apart part of them.’ 
Num
18:30  “And you shall say to them, ‘When
you have presented the best of it, then the rest shall be reckoned to the Lĕwites
as the yield of the threshing-floor and as the yield of the winepress. 
Num
18:31  ‘And you shall eat it in any
place, you and your households, for it is your reward for your service in the
Tent of Meeting, 
Num
18:32  and bear no sin because of it,
when you have presented the best of it, and do not profane the set-apart gifts
of the children of Yisra’ĕl, lest you die.’ ” 
Num
19:1  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh and to Aharon, saying, 
Num
19:2  “This is a law of the Torah which יהוה
has commanded, saying, ‘Speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl, that they bring
you a red heifer, a perfect one, in which there is no blemish and on which a
yoke has never come. 
Num
19:3  ‘And you shall give it to El‛azar
the priest, and he shall bring it outside the camp, and shall slaughter it
before him. 
Num
19:4  ‘And El‛azar the priest shall
take some of its blood with his finger, and sprinkle some of its blood seven
times toward the front of the Tent of Meeting. 
Num
19:5  ‘And the heifer shall be burned
before his eyes – he burns its hide, and its flesh, and its blood, and its
dung. 
Num
19:6  ‘And the priest shall take cedar
wood and hyssop and scarlet, and throw them into the midst of the fire burning
the heifer. 
Num
19:7  ‘The priest shall then wash his
garments, and shall bathe his body in water, and afterward come into the camp,
but the priest is unclean until evening. 
Num
19:8  ‘And he who is burning it washes
his garments in water, and shall bathe his body in water, and is unclean until
evening. 
Num
19:9  ‘And a clean man shall gather up
the ashes of the heifer, and shall place them outside the camp in a clean
place. And they shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Yisra’ĕl
for the water for uncleanness, it is for cleansing from sin. 
Num
19:10  ‘And he who gathers the ashes of
the heifer shall wash his garments, and is unclean until evening. And it shall
be a law forever to the children of Yisra’ĕl and to the stranger who
sojourns in their midst. 
Num
19:11  ‘He who touches the dead of any
human being is unclean for seven days. 
Num
19:12  ‘He is to cleanse himself with the
water on the third day, and on the seventh day he is clean. But if he does not
cleanse himself on the third day, then on the seventh day he is not clean. 
Num
19:13  ‘Anyone who touches the dead of a
human being, and does not cleanse himself, defiles the Dwelling Place of יהוה.
And that being shall be cut off from Yisra’ĕl. He is unclean, for the
water for uncleanness was not sprinkled on him, his uncleanness is still upon
him. 
Num
19:14  ‘This is the Torah when a man dies
in a tent: All who come into the tent and all who are in the tent are unclean
for seven days, 
Num
19:15  and every open vessel which has no
cover fastened on it, is unclean. 
Num
19:16  ‘Anyone in the open field who
touches someone slain by a sword or who has died, or a bone of a man, or a
grave, is unclean for seven days. 
Num
19:17  ‘And for the unclean being they
shall take some of the ashes of the heifer burnt for cleansing from sin, and
running water shall be put on them in a vessel. 
Num
19:18  ‘And a clean man shall take hyssop
and dip it in the water, and shall sprinkle it on the tent, and on all the
vessels, and on the beings who were there, or on the one who touched a bone, or
the slain, or the dead, or a grave. 
Num
19:19  ‘And the clean one shall sprinkle
the unclean on the third day and on the seventh day. And on the seventh day he
shall cleanse himself, and shall wash his garments and bathe in water, and
shall be clean in the evening. 
Num
19:20  ‘But the man who is unclean and
does not cleanse himself, that being shall be cut off from among the assembly,
because he has defiled the set-apart place of יהוה –
water for uncleanness has not been sprinkled on him, he is unclean. 
Num
19:21  ‘And it shall be a law for them
forever. And the one who sprinkles the water for uncleanness washes his
garments. And the one who touches the water for uncleanness is unclean until
evening. 
Num
19:22  ‘And whatever the unclean being
touches is unclean. And the being who touches it is unclean until evening.’ ” 
Num
20:1  And the children of Yisra’ĕl,
all the congregation, came into the Wilderness of Tsin in the first month, and
the people stayed in Qaḏĕsh. And Miryam died there and was buried
there. 
Num
20:2  Now there was no water for the
congregation and they assembled against Mosheh and against Aharon. 
Num
20:3  And the people contended with
Mosheh and spoke, saying, “If only we had died when our brothers died before יהוה
! 
Num
20:4  “Why have you brought up the
assembly of יהוה into this wilderness, that we and our
livestock should die here? 
Num
20:5  “And why have you brought us up out
of Mitsrayim, to bring us to this evil place? – not a place of grain or figs or
vines or pomegranates, and there is no water to drink.” 
Num
20:6  Then Mosheh and Aharon went from
the presence of the assembly to the door of the Tent of Meeting, and they fell
on their faces. And the esteem of יהוה appeared to
them.
Num
20:7  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying, 
Num
20:8  “Take the rod and assemble the
congregation, you and your brother Aharon. And you shall speak to the rock
before their eyes, and it shall give its water. And you shall bring water for
them out of the rock and give drink to the congregation and their livestock.” 
Num
20:9  And Mosheh took the rod from before
יהוה as He commanded him. 
Num
20:10  And Mosheh and Aharon assembled
the assembly before the rock. And he said to them, “Hear now, you rebels, shall
we bring water for you out of this rock?” 
Num
20:11  Then Mosheh lifted his hand and
struck the rock twice with his rod. And much water came out, and the
congregation and their livestock drank. 
Num
20:12  But יהוה
spoke to Mosheh and to Aharon, “Because you did not believe Me, to set Me apart
in the eyes of the children of Yisra’ĕl, therefore you do not bring this
assembly into the land which I have given them.” 
Num
20:13  These were the waters of Meriḇah,
because the children of Yisra’ĕl contended with יהוה,
and He was set apart among them. 
Num
20:14  And Mosheh sent messengers from Qaḏĕsh
to the sovereign of Eḏom. “This is what your brother Yisra’ĕl said, ‘You
know all the hardship that has befallen us, 
Num
20:15  that our fathers went down to
Mitsrayim, and we dwelt in Mitsrayim a long time, and the Mitsrites did evil to
us and our fathers. 
Num
20:16  ‘And we cried out to יהוה,
and He heard our voice and sent the Messenger and brought us up out of
Mitsrayim. And see, we are in Qaḏĕsh, a city on the edge of your
border. 
Num
20:17  ‘Please let us pass over, through
your land. We shall not pass over through fields or vineyards, nor drink water
from wells, we shall go along the sovereign’s highway. We shall not turn aside,
right or left, until we have passed over your border.’ ” 
Num
20:18  But Eḏom said to him, “You
do not pass over through me, lest I come out against you with the sword.” 
Num
20:19  And the children of Yisra’ĕl
said to him, “We shall go by the highway, and if I or my livestock drink any of
your water, then I shall pay for it. Let me only pass over on foot, without a
word.” 
Num
20:20  But he said, “You do not pass
over.” And Eḏom came out against them with many men and with a strong
hand. 
Num
20:21  So when Eḏom refused to let
Yisra’ĕl pass over through his border, Yisra’ĕl turned away from him.

Num
20:22  And the children of Yisra’ĕl,
all the company, departed from Qaḏĕsh and came to Mount Hor. 
Num
20:23  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh and to Aharon in Mount Hor near the border of the land of Eḏom,
saying, 
Num
20:24  “Aharon is to be gathered to his
people, for he is not to enter the land which I have given to the children of
Yisra’ĕl, because you rebelled against My mouth at the water of Meriḇah.

Num
20:25  “Take Aharon and El‛azar his
son, and bring them up to Mount Hor, 
Num
20:26  and strip Aharon of his garments
and put them on El‛azar his son, for Aharon is to be gathered to his
people and die there.” 
Num
20:27  And Mosheh did as יהוה
commanded, and they went up to Mount Hor before the eyes of all the
congregation. 
Num
20:28  And Mosheh stripped Aharon of his
garments and put them on El‛azar his son. And Aharon died there on the
top of the mountain. And Mosheh and El‛azar came down from the mountain. 
Num
20:29  And when all the congregation saw
that Aharon was dead, all the house of Yisra’ĕl wept for Aharon, thirty
days. 
Num
21:1  And the sovereign of Araḏ, the
Kena‛anite, who dwelt in the South, heard that Yisra’ĕl was coming
on the way to Atharim, and he fought against Yisra’ĕl and took some of
them captive. 
Num
21:2  Then Yisra’ĕl made a vow to יהוה,
and said, “If You deliver this people into my hand indeed, then I shall put
their cities under the ban.” 
Num
21:3  And יהוה
listened to the voice of Yisra’ĕl and gave up the Kena‛anites, and
they put them and their cities under the ban. So the name of that place was
called Ḥormah. 
Num
21:4  And they departed from Mount Hor by
the Way of the Sea of Reeds, to go around the land of Eḏom. But the being
of the people grew impatient because of the way. 
Num
21:5  And the people spoke against Elohim
and against Mosheh, “Why have you brought us up out of Mitsrayim to die in the
wilderness? For there is no food and no water, and our being loathes this light
bread.” 
Num
21:6  And יהוה
sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people. And many of the
people of Yisra’ĕl died. 
Num
21:7  Then the people came to Mosheh, and
said, “We have sinned, for we have spoken against יהוה
and against you. Pray to יהוה to take away the serpents
from us.” So Mosheh prayed on behalf of the people. 
Num
21:8  And יהוה
said to Mosheh, “Make a fiery serpent, and set it on a pole. And it shall be
that everyone who is bitten, when he looks at it, shall live.” 
Num
21:9  So Mosheh made a bronze serpent,
and put it on a pole. And it came to be, if a serpent had bitten anyone, when
he looked at the bronze serpent, he lived. 
Num
21:10  And the children of Yisra’ĕl
set out and camped in Oḇoth. 
Num
21:11  And they departed from Oḇoth
and camped at Iyĕ Ha-Aḇarim, in the wilderness which is east of Mo’aḇ,
toward sunrise. 
Num
21:12  From there they set out and camped
at the wadi Zereḏ. 
Num
21:13  From there they set out and camped
on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness that extends from
the border of the Amorites, for the Arnon is the border of Mo’aḇ, between
Mo’aḇ and the Amorites. 
Num
21:14  Therefore it is said in the Book
of the Battles of יהוה, “Wahĕḇ in Suphah,
the wadi Arnon, 
Num
21:15  and the slope of the wadi that
turns aside to the dwelling of Ar, and lies on the border of Mo’aḇ.” 
Num
21:16  And from there on to Be’ĕr,
which is the well where יהוה said to Mosheh, “Gather
the people, and let Me give them water.” 
Num
21:17  Yisra’ĕl then sang this song:
“Spring up, O well! Sing to it, 
Num
21:18  a well the leaders sank, which the
nobles of the people dug with their staves, by the word of the Law-giver.” Then from the wilderness on to
Mattanah, 
Num
21:19  from Mattanah to Naḥali’ĕl,
from Naḥali’ĕl to Bamoth, 
Num
21:20  and from Bamoth, in the valley
that is in the country of Mo’aḇ, to the top of Pisgah which looks down on
the wasteland. 
Num
21:21  And Yisra’ĕl sent messengers
to Siḥon sovereign of the Amorites, saying, 
Num
21:22  “Let me pass through your land. We
shall not turn off into fields or vineyards, we shall not drink water from
wells, but go by the sovereign’s highway until we have passed over your border.”

Num
21:23  But Siḥon would not allow
Yisra’ĕl to pass through his border. So Siḥon gathered all his
people together and went out against Yisra’ĕl in the wilderness, and he
came to Yahats and fought against Yisra’ĕl. 
Num
21:24  And Yisra’ĕl smote him with
the edge of the sword, and took possession of his land from the Arnon to the
Yabboq, as far as the children of Ammon, for the border of the children of
Ammon was strong. 
Num
21:25  And Yisra’ĕl took all these
cities, and Yisra’ĕl dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites – in Ḥeshbon
and in all its villages, 
Num
21:26  for Ḥeshbon was the city of
Siḥon the sovereign of the Amorites, who had fought against the former
sovereign of Mo’aḇ, and had taken all his land from his hand as far as
the Arnon. 
Num
21:27  That is why those who speak in
proverbs say, “Come to Ḥeshbon, let the city of Siḥon be built and
established. 
Num
21:28  “For fire went out from Ḥeshbon,
a flame from the city of Siḥon. It consumed Ar of Mo’aḇ, the
masters of the heights of the Arnon. 
Num
21:29  “Woe to you, Mo’aḇ! You have
perished, O people of Kemosh! He has given his sons as fugitives, and his
daughters into captivity, to Siḥon the sovereign of the Amorites. 
Num
21:30  “Then we shot them – Ḥeshbon
has perished as far as Diḇon. And we laid waste as far as Nophaḥ,
which reaches to Mĕyḏeḇa.” 
Num
21:31  So Yisra’ĕl dwelt in the land
of the Amorites. 
Num
21:32  And Mosheh sent to spy out Ya‛zĕr.
And they took its villages and drove out the Amorites who were there, 
Num
21:33  and turned and went up by the way
to Bashan. And Oḡ sovereign of Bashan went out against them, he and all
his people, to battle at Eḏre‛i. 
Num
21:34  And יהוה
said to Mosheh, “Do not fear him, for I have given him into your hand, with all
his people and his land. And you shall do to him as you did to Siḥon
sovereign of the Amorites, who dwelt at Ḥeshbon.” 
Num
21:35  And they smote him, and his sons,
and all his people, until no remnant was left to him. And they took possession
of his land. 
Num
22:1  And the children of Yisra’ĕl
set out and camped in the desert plains of Mo’aḇ beyond the Yardĕn
of Yeriḥo. 
Num
22:2  And Balaq son of Tsippor saw all
that Yisra’ĕl had done to the Amorites. 
Num
22:3  And Mo’aḇ was exceedingly
afraid of the people because they were many, and Mo’aḇ was in dread
because of the children of Yisra’ĕl. 
Num
22:4  And Mo’aḇ said to the elders
of Miḏyan, “Now this company is licking up all that is around us, as an
ox licks up the grass of the field.” Now Balaq son of Tsippor was sovereign of
the Mo’aḇites at that time, 
Num
22:5  and he sent messengers to Bil‛am
son of Be‛or at Pethor, which is near the River in the land of the sons
of his people, to call him, saying, “See, a people has come from Mitsrayim.
See, they have covered the surface of the land, and are settling next to me!
Num
22:6  “And now, please come at once,
curse this people for me, for they are too strong for me. It might be that I
smite them and drive them out of the land, for I know that he whom you bless is
blessed, and he whom you curse is cursed.” 
Num
22:7  And the elders of Mo’aḇ and
the elders of Miḏyan left with the
fees for divination in their hand, and they came to Bil‛am and spoke
the words of Balaq to him. 
Num
22:8  And he said to them, “Spend the
night here, and I shall bring back word to you, as יהוה
speaks to me.” So the heads of Mo’aḇ stayed with Bil‛am. 
Num
22:9  And Elohim came to Bil‛am and
said, “Who are these men with you?” 
Num
22:10  And Bil‛am said to Elohim, “Balaq,
son of Tsippor, sovereign of Mo’aḇ, has sent to me, saying, 
Num
22:11  ‘See, a people has come out of
Mitsrayim and cover the surface of the land. Come now, curse them for me. It
might be that I am able to fight against them and drive them out.’ ” 
Num
22:12  And Elohim said to Bil‛am, “Do
not go with them. You do not curse the people, for they are blessed.” 
Num
22:13  And Bil‛am rose in the
morning and said to the heads of Balaq, “Go back to your land, for יהוה
has refused to allow me to go with you.” 
Num
22:14  And the heads of Mo’aḇ arose
and went to Balaq, and said, “Bil‛am refuses to come with us.” 
Num
22:15  Then Balaq again sent heads, more
numerous and more esteemed than they. 
Num
22:16  And they came to Bil‛am and
said to him, “This is what Balaq son of Tsippor said: ‘Do not be withheld from
coming to me, please, 
Num
22:17  for I esteem you very greatly, and
whatever you say to me, I do. Therefore please come, curse this people for me.’
” 
Num
22:18  And Bil‛am answered and said
to the servants of Balaq, “Though Balaq were to give me his house filled with
silver and gold, I am unable to go beyond the word of יהוה
my Elohim, to do less or more. 
Num
22:19  “And now, please, you also stay
here tonight, and let me find out what more יהוה says
to me.” 
Num
22:20  And Elohim came to Bil‛am at
night and said to him, “If the men come to call you, rise and go with them, but
only the word which I speak to you that you do.” 
Num
22:21  And Bil‛am rose in the
morning and saddled his donkey, and went with the heads of Mo’aḇ. 
Num
22:22  But the displeasure of Elohim
burned because he went, and the Messenger of יהוה
stationed Himself in the way as an adversary against him. And he was riding on
his donkey, and his two servants were with him. 
Num
22:23  And the donkey saw the Messenger
of יהוה standing in the way with His drawn sword in His
hand, and the donkey turned aside out of the way and went into the field. So
Bil‛am beat the donkey to turn her back onto the way. 
Num
22:24  Then the Messenger of יהוה
stood in a narrow passage between the vineyards, with a wall on this side and a
wall on that side. 
Num
22:25  And when the donkey saw the
Messenger of יהוה, she pushed herself against the wall
and crushed Bil‛am’s foot against the wall, so he beat her again. 
Num
22:26  And the Messenger of יהוה
went further, and stood in a narrow place where there was no way to turn aside,
right or left. 
Num
22:27  And when the donkey saw the
Messenger of יהוה, she lay down under Bil‛am. So
Bil‛am’s displeasure burned, and he beat the donkey with his staff. 
Num
22:28  Then יהוה
opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Bil‛am, “What have I done
to you, that you have beaten me these three times?” 
Num
22:29  And Bil‛am said to the
donkey, “Because you have mocked me. I wish there were a sword in my hand, for
I would have killed you by now!” 
Num
22:30  And the donkey said to Bil‛am,
“Am I not your donkey on which you have ridden, ever since I became yours, to
this day? Was I ever known to do so to you?” And he said, “No.”
Num
22:31  Then יהוה
opened Bil‛am’s eyes, and he saw the Messenger of יהוה
standing in the way with His drawn sword in His hand. And he bowed his head and
fell on his face. 
Num
22:32  And the Messenger of יהוה
said to him, “Why have you beaten your donkey these three times? See, I have
come out to stand against you, because your way is reckless before Me. 
Num
22:33  “And the donkey saw Me and turned
aside from Me these three times. If she had not turned aside from Me, I
certainly would have killed you by now, and let her live.” 
Num
22:34  And Bil‛am said to the
Messenger of יהוה, “I have sinned, for I did not know
You stood in the way against me. And now, if evil is in Your eyes, let me turn
back.” 
Num
22:35  And the Messenger of יהוה
said to Bil‛am, “Go with the men, but only the word that I speak to you,
that you speak.” Bil‛am then went with the heads of Balaq. 
Num
22:36  And when Balaq heard that Bil‛am
was coming, he went out to meet him at the city of Mo’aḇ, which is on the
border at the Arnon, which was in the extremity of the border. 
Num
22:37  And Balaq said to Bil‛am, “Did
I not urgently send to you, calling for you? Why did you not come to me? Am I
not able to esteem you?” 
Num
22:38  And Bil‛am said to Balaq, “See,
I have come to you! Now, am I at all able to say somewhat? The word that Elohim
puts in my mouth, that I speak.” 
Num
22:39  And Bil‛am went with Balaq,
and they came to Qiryath Ḥutsoth. 
Num
22:40  And Balaq slaughtered cattle and
sheep, and he sent some to Bil‛am and to the heads who were with him. 
Num
22:41  And it came to be the next day,
that Balaq took Bil‛am and brought him up to the high places of Ba‛al,
and from there he saw the extremity of the camp. 
Num
23:1  And Bil‛am said to Balaq, “Build
seven altars for me here, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me here.” 
Num
23:2  And Balaq did as Bil‛am had
spoken, and Balaq and Bil‛am offered a bull and a ram on each altar. 
Num
23:3  Bil‛am then said to Balaq, “Stand
by your burnt offering, and let me go on. It might be that יהוה
does come to meet me, and whatever He shows me I shall declare to you.” And he
went to a bare height. 
Num
23:4  And Elohim came to Bil‛am,
and he said to Him, “I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered on
each altar a bull and a ram.” 
Num
23:5  And יהוה
put a word in the mouth of Bil‛am, and said, “Return to Balaq, and this
is what you say.” 
Num
23:6  And he returned to him and saw him
standing by his burnt offering, he and all the heads of Mo’aḇ. 
Num
23:7  And he took up his proverb and
said, “Balaq the sovereign of Mo’aḇ has brought me from Aram, from the
mountains of the east. ‘Come, curse Ya‛aqoḇ for me, and come, rage
at Yisra’ĕl!’ 
Num
23:8  “How do I curse whom Ĕl has
not cursed? And how do I rage at whom יהוה has not
raged? 
Num
23:9  “For from the top of the rocks I
see him, and from the hills I observe him. Look, a people dwelling alone, not
reckoning itself among the nations. 
Num
23:10  “Who shall count the dust of Ya‛aqoḇ,
and the number of one-fourth of Yisra’ĕl? Let me die the death of the
upright, and let my end be like his!” 
Num
23:11  And Balaq said to Bil‛am, “What
have you done to me? I took you to curse my enemies, and look, you have kept on
blessing!”
Num
23:12  And he answered and said, “Should
I not take heed to speak what יהוה has put in my mouth?”

Num
23:13  And Balaq said to him, “Please
come with me to another place from where you see them. You only see the
extremity but not all of them. Curse them for me from there.” 
Num
23:14  And he took him to the field of
Tsophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bull and a
ram on each altar. 
Num
23:15  And he said to Balaq, “Stand here
by your burnt offering while I meet over there.” 
Num
23:16  And יהוה
came to Bil‛am, and put a word in his mouth, and said, “Go back to Balaq,
and say this.” 
Num
23:17  So he went to him and saw him
standing by his burnt offering, and the heads of Mo’aḇ with him. And
Balaq asked him, “What did יהוה say?” 
Num
23:18  And he took up his proverb and
said, “Rise up, Balaq, and hear! Listen to me, son of Tsippor! 
Num
23:19  “Ĕl is not a man, to lie; nor
a son of man, to repent! Has He said, and would He not do it; or spoken, and
would not confirm it? 
Num
23:20  “See, I have received, to bless.
And He has blessed, and I do not reverse it. 
Num
23:21  “He has not looked upon wickedness
in Ya‛aqoḇ, nor has He seen trouble in Yisra’ĕl. יהוה
his Elohim is with him, and the shout of a Sovereign is in him. 
Num
23:22  “Ĕl who brought them out of
Mitsrayim, is for them like the horns of a wild ox. 
Num
23:23  “For there is no sorcery against
Ya‛aqoḇ, nor is there any divination against Yisra’ĕl. Now it
is said to Ya‛aqoḇ and to Yisra’ĕl, ‘What has Ĕl done!’ 
Num
23:24  “Look, a people rises like a lioness,
and lifts itself up like a lion; it lies not down until it devours the prey,
and drinks the blood of the slain.” 
Num
23:25  And Balaq said to Bil‛am, “Do
not curse them at all, nor bless them at all!” 
Num
23:26  And Bil‛am answered and said
to Balaq, “Have I not spoken to you, saying, ‘All that יהוה
speaks, that I do’?” 
Num
23:27  And Balaq said to Bil‛am, “Please
come, let me take you to another place. It might be right in the eyes of Elohim
that you curse them for me from there.” 
Num
23:28  And Balaq took Bil‛am to the
top of Pe‛or, that overlooks the wasteland. 
Num
23:29  And Bil‛am said to Balaq, “Build
seven alters for me here, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me here.” 
Num
23:30  And Balaq did as Bil‛am had
said, and offered a bull and a ram on each altar. 
Num
24:1  And when Bil‛am saw that it
pleased יהוה to bless Yisra’ĕl, he did not go as
at other times, to seek to use sorcery, but he set his face toward the
wilderness. 
Num
24:2  And Bil‛am lifted up his eyes
and saw Yisra’ĕl encamped according to their tribes. And the Spirit of
Elohim came upon him. 
Num
24:3  And he took up his proverb and
said, “The saying of Bil‛am, son of Be‛or, and the saying of the
man whose eyes are opened, 
Num
24:4  the saying of him who hears the
words of Ĕl, who sees the vision of the Almighty, who falls down, with
eyes opened wide: 
Num
24:5  “How good are your tents, O Ya‛aqoḇ,
your dwellings, O Yisra’ĕl! 
Num
24:6  “Like wadis that stretch out, like
gardens by a river, like aloes planted by יהוה, like
cedars beside waters. 
Num
24:7  “He makes water flow from his
buckets, and his seed is in many waters. His sovereign is higher than Aḡaḡ,
and his reign is exalted. 
Num
24:8  “Ĕl who brought him out of
Mitsrayim is for them like the horns of a wild ox; he devours nations, his
enemies; and he breaks their bones, and with his arrows he smites. 
Num
24:9  “He bowed down, he lay down like a
lion. And, like a lion, who would rouse him? Blessed is he who blesses you, and
cursed is he who curses you.” 
Num
24:10  Then the displeasure of Balaq
burned against Bil‛am, and he struck his hands together. Balaq then said
to Bil‛am, “I summoned you to curse my enemies, and see, you have kept on
blessing, these three times! 
Num
24:11  “And now flee to your place. I
said I would greatly esteem you, and see, יהוה has kept
you back from esteem.” 
Num
24:12  And Bil‛am said to Balaq, “Did
I not also speak to your messengers whom you sent to me, saying, 
Num
24:13  ‘If Balaq should give me his house
filled with silver and gold, I am unable to go beyond the word of יהוה,
to do either good or evil of my own heart. What יהוה
speaks, that I speak’? 
Num
24:14  “And now, see, I am going to my
people. Come, let me advise you what this people is going to do to your people
in the latter days.” 
Num
24:15  And he took up his proverb and
said, “The saying of Bil‛am, son of Be‛or, and the saying of the
man whose eyes are opened, 
Num
24:16  the saying of him who hears the
words of Ĕl, and knows the knowledge of the Most High, who sees the vision
of the Almighty, who falls down, with eyes opened wide: 
Num
24:17  “I see Him, but not now; I observe
Him, but not near. A Star shall come out of Ya‛aqoḇ, and a Sceptre
shall rise out of Yisra’ĕl, and shall smite the corners of Mo’aḇ,
and shall destroy all the sons of Shĕth. 
Num
24:18  “And Eḏom shall be a
possession; and Sĕ‛ir shall be a possession – enemies – and Yisra’ĕl
is doing mightily. 
Num
24:19  “And out of Ya‛aqoḇ One shall rule and destroy the remnant
from Ar.” 
Num
24:20  He then looked on Amalĕq, and
he took up his proverb and said, “Amalĕq was first among the nations, but
his latter end is to perish forever.” 
Num
24:21  He then looked on the Qĕynites,
and he took up his proverb and said, “Firm is your dwelling place, and your nest
is set in the rock, 
Num
24:22  but Qayin is to be burned. Till
when does Asshur keep you captive?” 
Num
24:23  And he took up his proverb and
said, “Oh, who does live when Ĕl does this? 
Num
24:24  And ships shall come from the
coast of Kittim, and they shall afflict Asshur and afflict Ĕḇer, and
so shall Amalĕq, and he also perishes.” 
Num
24:25  And Bil‛am arose and left,
and returned to his place. And Balaq also went his way. 
Num
25:1  And Yisra’ĕl dwelt in Shittim,
and the people began to whore with the daughters of Mo’aḇ, 
Num
25:2  and they invited the people to the
slaughterings of their mighty ones, and the people ate and bowed down to their
mighty ones. 
Num
25:3  Thus Yisra’ĕl was joined to Ba‛al
Pe‛or, and the displeasure of יהוה burned against
Yisra’ĕl. 
Num
25:4  And יהוה
said to Mosheh, “Take all the leaders of the people and hang them up before יהוה,
before the sun, so that the burning displeasure of יהוה
turns away from Yisra’ĕl.” 
Num
25:5  And Mosheh said to the judges of
Yisra’ĕl, “Each one of you slay his men who were joined to Ba‛al Pe‛or.”

Num
25:6  And see, one of the children of
Yisra’ĕl came and brought to his brothers a Miḏyanite woman before
the eyes of Mosheh and before the eyes of all the congregation of the children
of Yisra’ĕl, who were weeping at the door of the Tent of Meeting. 
Num
25:7  And when Pineḥas, son of El‛azar,
son of Aharon the priest, saw it, he rose up from among the congregation and
took a spear in his hand, 
Num
25:8  and he went after the man of Yisra’ĕl
into the tent and thrust both of them through, the man of Yisra’ĕl, and
the woman through her belly. Thus the plague among the children of Yisra’ĕl
came to a stop. 
Num
25:9  And those who died in the plague
were twenty-four thousand. 
Num
25:10  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying, 
Num
25:11  “Pineḥas, son of El‛azar,
son of Aharon the priest, has turned back My wrath from the children of Yisra’ĕl,
because he was ardent with My ardour in their midst, so that I did not consume
the children of Yisra’ĕl in My ardour. 
Num
25:12  “Therefore say, ‘See, I am giving
him My covenant of peace, 
Num
25:13  and it shall be to him and to his
seed after him a covenant of an everlasting priesthood, because he was ardent
for his Elohim, and made atonement for the children of Yisra’ĕl.’ ” 
Num
25:14  And the name of the Yisra’ĕlite
who was killed, who was killed with the Miḏyanite woman, was Zimri, son
of Salu, a leader of a father’s house among the Shim‛onites. 
Num
25:15  And the name of the Miḏyanite
woman who was killed was Kozbi the daughter of Tsur. He was head of the people
of a father’s house in Miḏyan. 
Num
25:16  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying, 
Num
25:17  “Distress the Miḏyanites!
And you shall smite them, 
Num
25:18  for they distressed you with their
tricks with which they deceived you in the matter of Pe‛or and in the
matter of Kozbi, the daughter of a leader of Miḏyan, their sister, who
was killed in the day of the plague because of Pe‛or.” 
Num
26:1  And it came to be, after the
plague, that יהוה spoke to Mosheh and El‛azar,
son of Aharon the priest, saying, 
Num
26:2  “Take a census of all the
congregation of the children of Yisra’ĕl from twenty years old and above,
by their fathers’ houses, everyone going out to the army in Yisra’ĕl.” 
Num
26:3  So Mosheh and El‛azar the
priest spoke with them in the desert plains of Mo’aḇ by the Yardĕn
of Yeriḥo, saying, 
Num
26:4  “Take
a census of the people from twenty years old and above, as יהוה
commanded Mosheh and the children of Yisra’ĕl who came out of the land of
Mitsrayim.” 
Num

Num
26:8  And the son of Pallu: Eliyaḇ.

Num
26:9  And the sons of Eliyaḇ: Nemu’ĕl,
and Dathan, and Aḇiram. This Dathan and Aḇiram, were the called
ones of the congregation, who contended against Mosheh and against Aharon in
the company of Qoraḥ, when they contended against יהוה,

Num
26:10  and the earth opened its mouth and
swallowed them up together with Qoraḥ when that company died, when the
fire consumed two hundred and fifty men. And they became a sign, 
Num
26:11  but the sons of Qoraḥ did
not die.

these as an inheritance, according to the number of names. 
Num
26:54  “To the large one you give a
larger inheritance, and to the small one you give a smaller inheritance. Each
shall be given its inheritance according to their registered ones. 
Num
26:55  “But the land is divided by lot,

26:61  And Naḏaḇ and Aḇihu
died when they brought strange fire before יהוה. 
Num
26:62  And their registered ones were
twenty-three thousand, every male from a month old and above. For they were not
registered among the other children of Yisra’ĕl, because there was no
inheritance given to them among the children of Yisra’ĕl. 
Num
26:63  These are the ones registered by
Mosheh and El‛azar the priest, who registered the sons of Yisra’ĕl
in the desert plains of Mo’aḇ by the Yardĕn of Yeriḥo. 
Num
26:64  But among these there was not a
man of those registered by Mosheh and Aharon the priest when they registered
the sons of Yisra’ĕl in the Wilderness of Sinai. 
Num
26:65  For יהוה
had said of them, “They shall certainly die in the wilderness.” And not a man
was left of them, except Kalĕḇ son of Yephunneh, and Yehoshua son of
Nun.

27:1  Then came the daughters of

Num
27:3  “Our father died in the wilderness,
yet he was not in the company of those who were met together against יהוה,
in company with Qoraḥ, but he died in his own sin. And he had no sons. 
Num
27:4  “Why should the name of our father
be removed from among his clan because he had no son? Give us a possession
among the brothers of our father.” 
Num
27:5  Mosheh then brought their case
before יהוה. 
Num
27:6  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying, 
Num
27:7  “The daughters of Tselophḥaḏ
speak what is right. You should certainly give them a possession of inheritance
among their father’s brothers, and cause the inheritance of their father to
pass to them. 
Num
27:8  “And speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl,
saying, ‘When a man dies and has no son, then you shall cause his inheritance
to pass to his daughter. 
Num
27:9  ‘And if he has no daughter, then
you shall give his inheritance to his brothers. 
Num
27:10  ‘And if he has no brothers, then
you shall give his inheritance to his father’s brothers. 
Num
27:11  ‘And if his father has no
brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to the nearest relative in his
clan, and he shall possess it.’ ” And it shall be to the children of Yisra’ĕl
a law of right-ruling, as יהוה commanded Mosheh. 
Num
27:12  And יהוה
said to Mosheh, “Go up into this Mount Aḇarim, and see the land which I
have given to the children of Yisra’ĕl. 
Num
27:13  “And when you have seen it, you also
shall be gathered to your people as Aharon your brother was gathered, 
Num
27:14  because you rebelled against My
mouth in the Wilderness of Tsin, in the strife of the congregation, to set Me
apart at the waters before their eyes.” These were the waters of Meriḇah,
at Qaḏĕsh in the Wilderness of Tsin. 
Num
27:15  And Mosheh spoke to יהוה,
saying, 
Num
27:16  “Let יהוה,
the Elohim of the spirits of all flesh, appoint a man over the congregation,
Num
27:17  who goes out before them and comes
in before them, who leads them out and brings them in, so that the congregation
of יהוה be not like sheep without a shepherd.”
Num
27:18  And יהוה
said to Mosheh, “Take Yehoshua son of Nun with you, a man in whom is the
Spirit. And you shall lay your hand on him, 
Num
27:19  and shall set him before El‛azar
the priest and before all the congregation, and give him charge before their
eyes, 
Num
27:20  and shall put some of your esteem
upon him, so that all the congregation of the children of Yisra’ĕl obey him. 
Num
27:21  “And he is to stand before El‛azar
the priest, who shall inquire before יהוה for him by
the right-ruling of the Urim. At his word they go out, and at his word they
come in, both he and all the children of Yisra’ĕl with him, all the
congregation.” 
Num
27:22  And Mosheh did as יהוה
commanded him, and took Yehoshua and set him before El‛azar the priest
and before all the congregation, 
Num
27:23  and laid his hands on him and
commissioned him, as יהוה commanded by the hand of
Mosheh. 
Num
28:1  And יהוה spoke
to Mosheh, saying,
Num
28:2  “Command the children of Yisra’ĕl,
and you shall say to them, ‘Take heed to bring My offering, My food for My
offerings made by fire as a sweet fragrance to Me, at their appointed time.’ 
Num
28:3  “And you shall say to them, ‘This
is the offering made by fire which you bring to יהוה :
two male lambs a year old, perfect ones, daily, a continual burnt offering. 
Num
28:4  ‘The one lamb you prepare in the
morning, and the other lamb you prepare between the evenings, 
Num
28:5  with one-tenth of an ĕphah of
fine flour as a grain offering mixed with one-fourth of a hin of pressed oil, 
Num
28:6  a continual burnt offering which
was offered at Mount Sinai for a sweet fragrance, an offering made by fire to יהוה,

Num
28:7  and its drink offering, one-fourth
of a hin for each lamb. Pour out the drink to יהוה as
an offering in the set-apart place. 
Num
28:8  ‘And the other lamb you prepare
between the evenings. As the morning grain offering and its drink offering, you
prepare it as an offering made by fire, a sweet fragrance to יהוה.

Num
28:9  ‘And on the Sabbath day two lambs a
year old, perfect ones, and two-tenths of
an ĕphah of fine flour as a grain offering, mixed with oil, with its
drink offering, 
Num
28:10  the burnt offering for every
Sabbath, besides the continual burnt offering with its drink offering. 
Num
28:11  ‘And on the beginnings of your
months you bring near a burnt offering to יהוה : two
young bulls and one ram, and seven lambs a year old, perfect ones; 
Num
28:12  three-tenths of an ĕphah of fine flour as a grain offering, mixed with oil,
for each bull; two-tenths of an ĕphah
of fine flour as a grain offering, mixed with oil, for the one ram; 
Num
28:13  and one-tenth of an ĕphah of fine flour, mixed with oil, as a grain offering
for each lamb, as a burnt offering of sweet fragrance, an offering made by fire
to יהוה. 
Num
28:14  ‘And their drink offering is half
a hin of wine for a bull, and one-third of a hin for a ram, and one-fourth of a
hin for a lamb. This is the burnt offering for each month throughout the months
of the year, 
Num
28:15  and one male goat as a sin
offering to יהוה is prepared, besides the continual
burnt offering and its drink offering. 
Num
28:16  ‘And in the first month, on the
fourteenth day, is the Passover of יהוה, 
Num
28:17  and on the fifteenth day of this
month is a festival. For seven days unleavened bread is eaten. 
Num
28:18  ‘On the first day is a set-apart
gathering, you do no servile work. 
Num
28:19  ‘And you shall bring near an offering
made by fire as a burnt offering to יהוה : two young
bulls and one ram, and seven lambs a year old, perfect ones they are for you, 
Num
28:20  and their grain offering, fine
flour mixed with oil. Prepare three-tenths of
an ĕphah for a bull, and two-tenths for a ram. 
Num
28:21  ‘Prepare one-tenth of an ĕphah for each of the seven
lambs, 
Num
28:22  and one goat as a sin offering, to
make atonement for you. 
Num
28:23  ‘Prepare these besides the burnt
offering of the morning, which is for a continual burnt offering. 
Num
28:24  ‘According to these you are to
prepare the food of the offering made by fire daily for seven days, as a sweet
fragrance to יהוה. It is prepared besides the continual
burnt offering and its drink offering. 
Num
28:25  ‘And on the seventh day you have a
set-apart gathering, you do no servile work. 
Num
28:26  ‘And on the day of the
first-fruits, when you bring a new grain offering to יהוה
at your Festival of Weeks, you have a set-apart gathering, you do no servile
work. 
Num
28:27  ‘And you shall bring near a burnt
offering as a sweet fragrance to יהוה : two young
bulls, one ram, and seven lambs a year old, 
Num
28:28  with their grain offering of fine
flour mixed with oil: three-tenths of an ĕphah

28:30  one male goat to make atonement
for you,

28:31  perfect ones they are for you.
Prepare them with their drink offerings, besides the continual burnt offering
with its grain offering. 
Num
29:1  ‘And in the seventh month, on the
first day of the month, you have a set-apart gathering, you do no servile work,
it is a day of blowing the trumpets for you. 
Num
29:2  ‘And you shall prepare a burnt
offering as a sweet fragrance to יהוה : one young bull,

Num
29:6  besides the burnt offering with its
grain offering for the New Moon, the continual burnt offering with its grain
offering, and their drink offerings, according to their right-ruling, as a
sweet fragrance, an offering made by fire to יהוה. 
Num
29:7  ‘And on the tenth day of this
seventh month you have a set-apart gathering, and you shall afflict your
beings, you do no work. 
Num
29:8  ‘And you shall bring near a burnt
offering to יהוה, a sweet fragrance: one young bull,

Num
29:12  ‘And on the fifteenth day of the
seventh month you have a set-apart gathering, you do no servile work. And you
shall observe a festival to יהוה seven days, 
Num
29:13  and you shall bring near a burnt
offering, an offering made by fire, a sweet fragrance to יהוה
: thirteen young bulls, two rams, fourteen lambs a year old, perfect ones they
are, 
Num

Num
29:39  ‘These you prepare to יהוה
at your appointed times, besides your vowed offerings and your voluntary
offerings, as your burnt offerings and your grain offerings, as your drink
offerings and your peace offerings.’ ” 
Num
29:40  And Mosheh spoke to the children
of Yisra’ĕl according to all יהוה had commanded Mosheh.

Num
30:1  And Mosheh spoke to the heads of
the tribes concerning the children of Yisra’ĕl, saying, “This is the word
which יהוה has commanded: 
Num
30:2  “When a man vows a vow to יהוה,
or swears an oath to bind himself by some agreement, he does not break his
word, he does according to all that comes out of his mouth. 
Num
30:3  “Or if a woman vows a vow to יהוה,
and binds herself by some agreement while in her father’s house in her youth, 
Num
30:4  and her father hears her vow and
the agreement by which she has bound herself, and her father has kept silent
towards her, then all her vows shall stand, and every agreement with which she
has bound herself stands. 
Num
30:5  “But if her father forbids her on
the day that he hears, then none of her vows nor her agreements by which she
has bound herself stand. And יהוה pardons her, because
her father has forbidden her. 
Num
30:6  “But if she at all belongs to a
husband, while bound by her vows or by a rash utterance from her lips by which
she bound herself, 
Num
30:7  and her husband hears it, and he
has kept silent towards her on the day that he hears, then her vows shall
stand, and her agreements by which she bound herself do stand. 
Num
30:8  “But if her husband forbids her on
the day that he hears it, then he has nullified her vow which she vowed, and
the rash utterance of her lips by which she bound herself, and יהוה
pardons her. 
Num
30:9  “But any vow of a widow or a
divorced woman, by which she has bound herself, stands against her. 
Num
30:10  “And if she vowed in her husband’s
house, or bound herself by an agreement with an oath, 
Num
30:11  and her husband heard it, and has
kept silent towards her and did not forbid her, then all her vows shall stand,
and every agreement by which she bound herself stands. 
Num
30:12  “But if her husband clearly
nullified them on the day he heard them, then whatever came from her lips
concerning her vows or concerning the agreement binding her, it does not stand –
her husband has nullified them, and יהוה pardons her. 
Num
30:13  “Every vow and every binding oath
to afflict her being, let her husband confirm it, or let her husband nullify
it. 
Num
30:14  “But if her husband is altogether
silent at her from day to day, then he confirms all her vows or all the
agreements that bind her – he confirms them, because he kept silent towards her
on the day that he heard. 
Num
30:15  “But if he nullifies them after he
has heard, then he shall bear her crookedness.” 
Num
30:16  These are the laws which יהוה
commanded Mosheh, between a man and his wife, and between a father and his
daughter in her youth in her father’s house. 
Num
31:1  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying, 
Num
31:2  “Take vengeance for the children of
Yisra’ĕl on the Miḏyanites. After that you are to be gathered to your
people.” 
Num
31:3  And Mosheh spoke to the people,
saying, “Arm some of yourselves for the campaign, and let them go against the
Miḏyanites to take vengeance for יהוה on Miḏyan.

Num
31:4  “Send a thousand from each tribe of
all the tribes of Yisra’ĕl for the campaign.” 
Num
31:5  So there were supplied from the
tribes of Yisra’ĕl one thousand from each tribe, twelve thousand armed
ones for the campaign. 
Num
31:6  And Mosheh sent them on the
campaign, one thousand from each tribe, them and Pineḥas son of El‛azar
the priest on the campaign, with the set-apart utensils and the trumpets for
sounding in his hand. 
Num
31:7  And they fought against the Miḏyanites,
as יהוה commanded Mosheh, and slew all the males. 
Num
31:8  And they slew the sovereigns of Miḏyan
with the rest of those who were pierced: Ewi, and Reqem, and Tsur, and Ḥur,
and Reḇa, the five sovereigns of Miḏyan. And they slew Bil‛am
son of Be‛or with the sword. 
Num
31:9  And the sons of Yisra’ĕl took
all the women of Miḏyan captive, with their little ones, and took as
spoil all their livestock, and all their possessions. 
Num
31:10  And they burned with fire all the
cities where they dwelt, and all their settlements. 
Num
31:11  And they took all the spoil and
all the booty, both of man and beast. 
Num
31:12  And they brought the captives, and
the booty, and the spoil to Mosheh, and to El‛azar the priest, and to the
congregation of the children of Yisra’ĕl, to the camp in the desert plains
of Mo’aḇ by the Yardĕn of Yeriḥo. 
Num
31:13  And Mosheh, and El‛azar the
priest, and all the leaders of the congregation, went to meet them outside the
camp. 
Num
31:14  But Mosheh was wroth with the
officers of the army, with the commanders of thousands and commanders of
hundreds, who had come from the campaign. 
Num
31:15  And Mosheh said to them, “Have you
kept all the women alive? 
Num
31:16  “Look, they are the ones who
caused the children of Yisra’ĕl, through the word of Bil‛am, to
trespass against יהוה in the matter of Pe‛or, and
there was a plague among the congregation of יהוה. 
Num
31:17  “And now, slay every male among
the little ones. And every woman who has known a man by lying with a man you
shall slay. 
Num
31:18  “But keep alive for yourselves all
the female children who have not known a man by lying with a man. 
Num
31:19  “And you, camp outside the camp
seven days. Whoever has slain any being, and whoever has touched any slain,
cleanse yourselves and your captives on the third day and on the seventh day. 
Num
31:20  “And cleanse every garment, and
every object of leather and all the work of goats’ hair, and every object of wood.” 
Num
31:21  And El‛azar the priest said
to the men of the campaign who went to the battle, “This is the law of the
Torah which יהוה commanded Mosheh: 
Num
31:22  “Only the gold, and the silver,
the bronze, the iron, the tin, and the lead, 
Num
31:23  every object that passes through
fire, you put through the fire, and it shall be clean; only, let it be cleansed
with the water for uncleanness. And whatever does not pass through fire you
pass through water. 
Num
31:24  “And you shall wash your garments
on the seventh day and be clean, and afterwards come into the camp.” 
Num
31:25  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying, 
Num
31:26  “Count up the plunder that was
taken, of man and of beast, you and El‛azar the priest and the heads of
the fathers of the congregation. 
Num
31:27  “And you shall divide the plunder
into two parts, between those who took part in the battle, who went out on the
campaign, and all the congregation. 
Num
31:28  “And set aside a levy for יהוה
on the men of battle who went out on the campaign: one out of every five
hundred, of man, and of the cattle, and of the donkeys, and of the sheep. 
Num
31:29  “Take it from their half, and give
it to El‛azar the priest as a contribution to יהוה.

Num
31:30  “And from the children of Yisra’ĕl’s
half you shall take one of every fifty, of man, of the cattle, of the donkeys,
and of the sheep, of all the livestock, and give them to the Lĕwites
guarding the duty of the Dwelling Place of יהוה.” 
Num
31:31  And Mosheh and El‛azar the
priest did as יהוה commanded Mosheh. 
Num
31:32  And the booty remaining from the
plunder, which the people of the campaign had taken, was six hundred and
seventy-five thousand sheep, 
Num
31:33  and seventy-two thousand cattle, 
Num
31:34  and sixty-one thousand donkeys, 
Num
31:35  and thirty-two thousand human
beings in all, of women who had not known a man by lying with a man. 
Num
31:36  And the half, the portion for
those who went out on the campaign, was in number three hundred and
thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep, 
Num
31:37  and the levy unto יהוה
of the sheep was six hundred and seventy-five. 
Num
31:38  And the cattle were thirty-six
thousand, of which the levy unto יהוה was seventy-two. 
Num
31:39  And the donkeys were thirty
thousand five hundred, of which the levy unto יהוה was
sixty-one. 
Num
31:40  And the human beings were sixteen
thousand, of which the levy unto יהוה was thirty-two
beings. 
Num
31:41  So Mosheh gave the levy which was
the contribution unto יהוה to El‛azar the priest,
as יהוה commanded Mosheh. 
Num
31:42  And from the children of Yisra’ĕl’s
half, which Mosheh divided from the men who campaigned: 
Num
31:43  now the half belonging to the
congregation was three hundred and thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep, 
Num
31:44  and thirty-six thousand cattle, 
Num
31:45  and thirty thousand five hundred
donkeys, 
Num
31:46  and sixteen thousand human beings.

Num
31:47  Then Mosheh took from the children
of Yisra’ĕl’s half: one out of every fifty, drawn from man and beast, and
gave them to the Lĕwites, who guarded the duty of the Dwelling Place of יהוה,
as יהוה commanded Mosheh.
Num
31:48  And the officers who were over
thousands of the campaign, the commanders of thousands and commanders of
hundreds, came near to Mosheh, 
Num
31:49  and they said to Mosheh, “Your
servants have taken a count of the fighting men under our command, and not a
man of us is missing. 
Num
31:50  “So we have brought an offering
for יהוה, what every man found of ornaments of gold:
armlets and bracelets and signet rings and earrings and necklaces, to make
atonement for ourselves before יהוה.” 
Num
31:51  And Mosheh and El‛azar the
priest received the gold from them, all the fashioned ornaments. 
Num
31:52  And all the gold of the offering
that they presented to יהוה, from the commanders of
thousands and commanders of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and
fifty sheqels. 
Num
31:53  The men of the campaign had taken
spoil, every man for himself. 
Num
31:54  And Mosheh and El‛azar the
priest received the gold from the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, and
brought it into the Tent of Meeting as a remembrance for the children of Yisra’ĕl
before יהוה. 
Num
32:1  And the children of Re’uḇĕn
and the children of Gaḏ had much livestock, a large number. And they saw
the land of Ya‛zĕr and the land of Gil‛aḏ and saw that
the place was a place for livestock. 
Num
32:2  So the children of Gaḏ and
the children of Re’uḇĕn came and spoke to Mosheh, and to El‛azar
the priest, and to the leaders of the congregation, saying, 
Num
32:3  “Ataroth, and Diḇon, and Ya‛zĕr,
and Nimrah, and Ḥeshbon, and El‛alĕh, and Seḇam, and Neḇo,
and Be‛on, 
Num
32:4  the land which יהוה
had smitten before the congregation of Yisra’ĕl, is a land for livestock,
and your servants have livestock.” 
Num
32:5  And they said, “If we have found
favour in your eyes, let this land be given to your servants as a possession,
and do not let us pass over the Yardĕn.” 
Num
32:6  And Mosheh said to the children of
Gaḏ and to the children of Re’uḇĕn, “Are your brothers to go
into the battle while you yourselves sit here? 
Num
32:7  “Now why do you discourage the
heart of the children of Yisra’ĕl from passing over into the land which יהוה
has given them? 
Num
32:8  “Thus your fathers did when I sent
them away from Qaḏĕsh Barnĕa to see the land. 
Num
32:9  “For when they went up to the wadi
Eshkol and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Yisra’ĕl,
so that they did not go into the land which יהוה had
given them. 
Num
32:10  “Then the displeasure of יהוה
burned on that day, and He swore an oath, saying, 
Num
32:11  ‘Not one of the men who came up
from Mitsrayim, from twenty years old and above, is to see the land of which I
swore to Aḇraham, Yitsḥaq, and Ya‛aqoḇ, because they
did not follow Me completely,
Num
32:12  except Kalĕḇ son of
Yephunneh, the Qenizzite, and Yehoshua son of Nun, for they have followed יהוה
completely.’ 
Num
32:13  “So the displeasure of יהוה
burned against Yisra’ĕl, and He made them wander in the wilderness forty
years, until all the generation that had done evil in the eyes of יהוה
was destroyed. 
Num
32:14  “And see, you have risen in your
father’s place, an increase of men, sinners, to add still more the burning
displeasure of יהוה against Yisra’ĕl. 
Num
32:15  “For if you turn away from
following Him, He shall once again leave them in the wilderness, and you shall
destroy all these people.” 
Num
32:16  Then they came near to him and
said, “Let us build sheep-enclosures here for our livestock, and cities for our
little ones, 
Num
32:17  but let us ourselves be armed,
hastening before the children of Yisra’ĕl until we have brought them to
their place. And our little ones shall dwell in the walled cities because of
the inhabitants of the land. 
Num
32:18  “We shall not return to our homes
until every one of the children of Yisra’ĕl has received his inheritance. 
Num
32:19  “For we shall not inherit with
them on the other side of the Yardĕn and beyond, because our inheritance
has fallen to us on this eastern side of the Yardĕn.” 
Num
32:20  And Mosheh said to them, “If you
make this promise: if you arm yourselves before יהוה
for battle, 
Num
32:21  and all your armed ones pass over
the Yardĕn before יהוה until He has driven out His
enemies from before Him, 
Num
32:22  and the land has been subdued
before יהוה, then afterward you shall return, and be
guiltless before יהוה and before Yisra’ĕl. And
this land shall be your possession before יהוה. 
Num
32:23  “But if you do not do so, then
see, you shall sin against יהוה, and know: your sin is
going to find you out. 
Num
32:24  “Build cities for your little ones
and enclosures for your sheep, and do what you have promised.” 
Num
32:25  And the children of Gaḏ and
the children of Re’uḇĕn spoke to Mosheh, saying, “Your servants are
going to do as my master commands. 
Num
32:26  “Our little ones, our wives, our
flocks, and all our livestock are going to be there in the cities of Gil‛aḏ,

Num
32:27  but your servants are passing
over, every armed one of the army, before יהוה, to
battle, as my master says.” 
Num
32:28  And Mosheh gave command concerning
them to El‛azar the priest, to Yehoshua son of Nun, and to the heads of
the fathers of the tribes of the children of Yisra’ĕl. 
Num
32:29  And Mosheh said to them, “If the
children of Gaḏ and the children of Re’uḇĕn pass over the Yardĕn
with you, every man armed for battle before יהוה, and
the land has been subdued before you, then you shall give them the land of Gil‛aḏ
as a possession. 
Num
32:30  “But if they do not pass over
armed with you, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Kena‛an.”

Num
32:31  Then the children of Gaḏ and
the children of Re’uḇĕn answered, saying, “As יהוה
has said to your servants, so we do. 
Num
32:32  “We ourselves are passing over
armed before יהוה into the land of Kena‛an, but
the possession of our inheritance remains with us beyond the Yardĕn.” 
Num
32:33  So Mosheh gave to the children of
Gaḏ, to the children of Re’uḇĕn, and to half the tribe of
Menashsheh, son of Yosĕph, the reign of Siḥon sovereign of the
Amorites and the reign of Oḡ sovereign of Bashan, the land with its
cities within the borders, the cities of the land round about. 
Num
32:34  And the children of Gaḏ
built Diḇon and Ataroth and Aro‛ĕr, 
Num
32:35  and Atroth, Shophan and Ya‛zĕr
and Yoḡbehah, 
Num
32:36  and Bĕyth Nimrah and Bĕyth
Haran, walled cities, and enclosures for sheep. 
Num
32:37  And the children of Re’uḇĕn
built Ḥeshbon and El‛alĕh and Qiryathayim, 
Num
32:38  Neḇo and Ba‛al Me‛on
– the names being changed – and Shiḇmah. And they gave other names to the
cities which they built. 
Num
32:39  And the sons of Maḵir son of
Menashsheh went to Gil‛aḏ and took it, and dispossessed the
Amorites who were in it. 
Num
32:40  So Mosheh gave Gil‛aḏ
to Maḵir, son of Menashsheh, and he dwelt in it. 
Num
32:41  And Ya’ir son of Menashsheh went
and took its small towns, and called them Ḥawoth Ya’ir. 
Num
32:42  And Noḇaḥ went and
took Qenath and its villages, and he called it Noḇaḥ, after his own
name. 
Num
33:1  These are the departures of the
children of Yisra’ĕl, who went out of the land of Mitsrayim by their
divisions under the hand of Mosheh and Aharon. 
Num
33:2  And Mosheh wrote down the starting
points of their departures at the command of יהוה, and
these are their departures according to their starting points: 
Num
33:3  So they departed from Ra‛meses
in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month, on the morrow of
the Passover the children of Yisra’ĕl went out with boldness before the
eyes of all the Mitsrites, 
Num
33:4  and the Mitsrites were burying all
their first-born, whom יהוה had smitten among them.
Also on their mighty ones יהוה had executed judgments. 
Num
33:5  Then the children of Yisra’ĕl
departed from Ra‛meses and camped at Sukkoth. 
Num
33:6  And they departed from Sukkoth and
camped at Ĕtham, which is on the edge of the wilderness. 
Num
33:7  And they departed from Ĕtham
and turned back to Pi Haḥiroth, which is east of Ba‛al Tsephon. And
they camped near Miḡdol. 
Num
33:8  And they departed from before
Haḥiroth and passed over through the midst of the sea into the
wilderness, went three days’ journey in the Wilderness of Ĕtham, and
camped at Marah. 
Num
33:9  And they departed from Marah and
came to Ĕlim. And at Ĕlim were twelve springs of water and seventy
palm trees, so they camped there. 
Num
33:10  And they departed from Ĕlim
and camped by the Sea of Reeds. 
Num
33:11  And they departed from the Sea of
Reeds and camped in the Wilderness of Sin. 
Num
33:12  And they departed from the
Wilderness of Sin and camped at Dophqah. 
Num
33:13  And they departed from Dophqah and
camped at Alush. 
Num
33:14  And they departed from Alush and
camped at Rephiḏim, and there was no water for the people to drink. 
Num
33:15  And they departed from Rephiḏim
and camped in the Wilderness of Sinai. 
Num
33:16  And they departed from the
Wilderness of Sinai and camped at Qiḇroth Hatta’awah. 
Num
33:17  And they departed from Qiḇroth
Hatta’awah and camped at Ḥatsĕroth. 
Num
33:18  And they departed from Ḥatsĕroth
and camped at Rithmah. 
Num
33:19  And they departed from Rithmah and
camped at Rimmon Perets. 
Num
33:20  And they departed from Rimmon
Perets and camped at Liḇnah. 
Num
33:21  And they departed from Liḇnah
and camped at Rissah. 
Num
33:22  And they departed from Rissah and
camped at Qehĕlathah. 
Num
33:23  And they departed from Qehĕlathah
and camped at Mount Shapher. 
Num
33:24  And they departed from Mount
Shapher and camped at Ḥaraḏah. 
Num
33:25  And they departed from Ḥaraḏah
and camped at Maqhĕloth. 
Num
33:26  And they departed from Maqhĕloth
and camped at Taḥath. 
Num
33:27  And they departed from
Taḥath and camped at Teraḥ. 
Num
33:28  And they departed from Teraḥ
and camped at Mithqah. 
Num
33:29  And they departed from Mithqah and
camped at Ḥashmonah. 
Num
33:30  And they departed from Ḥashmonah
and camped at Mosĕroth. 
Num
33:31  And they departed from Mosĕroth
and camped at Benĕi Ya‛aqan. 
Num
33:32  And they departed from Benĕi
Ya‛aqan and camped at Ḥor Haggiḏgaḏ. 
Num
33:33  And they departed from Ḥor
Haggiḏgaḏ and camped at Yotḇathah. 
Num
33:34  And they departed from Yotḇathah
and camped at Aḇronah. 
Num
33:35  And they departed from Aḇronah
and camped at Etsyon Geḇer. 
Num
33:36  And they departed from Etsyon Geḇer
and camped in the Wilderness of Tsin, which is Qaḏĕsh. 
Num
33:37  And they departed from Qaḏĕsh
and camped at Mount Hor, on the boundary of the land of Eḏom. 
Num
33:38  Then Aharon the priest went up to
Mount Hor at the command of יהוה, and died there in the
fortieth year after the children of Yisra’ĕl had come out of the land of
Mitsrayim, on the first day of the fifth month.
Num
33:39  Now Aharon was one hundred and
twenty-three years old when he died on Mount Hor. 
Num
33:40  And the sovereign of Araḏ,
the Kena‛anite, who dwelt in the South in the land of Kena‛an,
heard of the coming of the children of Yisra’ĕl. 
Num
33:41  So they departed from Mount Hor
and camped at Tsalmonah. 
Num
33:42  And they departed from Tsalmonah
and camped at Punon. 
Num
33:43  And they departed from Punon and
camped at Oḇoth. 
Num
33:44  And they departed from Oḇoth
and camped at Iyĕ Ha-Aḇarim, at the border of Mo’aḇ. 
Num
33:45  And they departed from Iyim and
camped at Diḇon Gaḏ. 
Num
33:46  And they departed from Diḇon
Gaḏ and camped at Almon Diḇlathayemah. 
Num
33:47  And they departed from Almon Diḇlathayemah
and camped in the mountains of Aḇarim, before Neḇo. 
Num
33:48  And they departed from the
mountains of Aḇarim and camped in the desert plains of Mo’aḇ by the
Yardĕn of Yeriḥo. 
Num
33:49  And they camped by the Yardĕn,
from Bĕyth Yeshimoth as far as the Aḇĕl Shittim in the desert
plains of Mo’aḇ. 
Num
33:50  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh in the desert plains of Mo’aḇ by the Yardĕn of
Yeriḥo, saying, 
Num
33:51  “Speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl,
and say to them, ‘When you have passed over the Yardĕn into the land of
Kena‛an, 
Num
33:52  then you shall drive out all the
inhabitants of the land from before you, and shall destroy all their engraved
stones, and shall destroy all their moulded images, and lay waste all their
high places, 
Num
33:53  and you shall possess the land and
dwell in it, for I have given you the land to possess. 
Num
33:54  ‘And you shall divide the land by
lot as an inheritance among your clans. To the larger you give a larger
inheritance, and to the smaller you give a smaller inheritance. Wherever the
lot falls to anyone, that is his. You inherit according to the tribes of your
fathers. 
Num
33:55  ‘And if you do not drive out the
inhabitants of the land from before you, then it shall be that those whom you
let remain shall be pricks in your eyes and thorns in your sides, and they
shall trouble you in the land where you dwell. 
Num
33:56  ‘And it shall be that I do to you
as I thought to do to them.’ ” 
Num
34:1  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying,
Num
34:2  “Command the children of Yisra’ĕl,
and say to them, ‘When you come into the land of Kena‛an, this is the
land which falls to you as an inheritance, the land of Kena‛an to its
boundaries: 
Num
34:3  ‘Then your southern border shall be
from the Wilderness of Tsin along the border of Eḏom, and your southern
border shall be eastward from the end of the Salt Sea. 
Num
34:4  ‘Then your border shall turn from
the southern side of the Ascent of Aqrabbim, continue to Tsin, and be on the
south of Qaḏĕsh Barnĕa, and it shall go on to Ḥatsar
Addar, and continue to Atsmon. 
Num
34:5  ‘And the border shall turn from
Atsmon to the wadi of Mitsrayim, and it shall end at the Sea. 
Num
34:6  ‘As for the western border, you
shall have the Great Sea for a border, this is your western border. 
Num
34:7  ‘And this is your northern border:
From the Great Sea you mark out your borderline to Mount Hor, 
Num
34:8  from Mount Hor you mark out your
border to the entrance of Ḥamath, and the edge of the border shall be
toward Tseḏaḏ, 
Num
34:9  and the border shall proceed to
Ziphron, and it shall end at Ḥatsar Ĕnan. This is your northern
border. 
Num
34:10  ‘And you shall mark out your
eastern border from Ḥatsar Ĕnan to Shepham, 
Num
34:11  and the border shall go down from
Shepham to Riḇlah on the east side of Ayin, and the border shall go down
and reach to the eastern side of the Sea of Kinnereth. 
Num
34:12  ‘And the border shall go down
along the Yardĕn, and it shall end at the Salt Sea. This is your land with
its surrounding boundaries.’ ” 
Num
34:13  And Mosheh commanded the children
of Yisra’ĕl, saying, “This is the land which you inherit by lot, which יהוה
has commanded to give to the nine tribes and to the half-tribe. 
Num
34:14  “For the tribe of the children of
Re’uḇĕn according to the house of their fathers, and the tribe of
the children of Gaḏ according to the house of their fathers, have
received their inheritance. And the half-tribe of Menashsheh has received its
inheritance. 
Num
34:15  “The two tribes and the half-tribe
have received their inheritance beyond the Yardĕn of Yeriḥo
eastward, toward the sunrise.” 
Num
34:16  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying, 
Num
34:17  “These are the names of the men
who divide the land among you as an inheritance: El‛azar the priest, and
Yehoshua son of Nun. 
Num
34:18  “And take one leader of every
tribe to divide the land for the inheritance. 
Num
34:19  “And these are the names of the
men. From the tribe of Yehuḏah: Kalĕḇ son of Yephunneh. 
Num
34:20  “And from the tribe of the
children of Shim‛on: Shemu’ĕl son of Ammihuḏ. 
Num
34:21  “From the tribe of Binyamin: Eliḏaḏ
son of Kislon. 
Num
34:22  “And a leader from the tribe of
the children of Dan: Buqqi son of Yoḡli. 
Num
34:23  “From the sons of Yosĕph: a
leader from the tribe of the children of Menashsheh, Ḥanni’ĕl son of
Ĕphoḏ. 
Num
34:24  “And a leader from the tribe of
the children of Ephrayim: Qemu’ĕl son of Shiphtan. 
Num
34:25  “And a leader from the tribe of
the children of Zeḇulun: Elitsaphan son of Parnaḵ. 
Num
34:26  “And a leader from the tribe of
the children of Yissasḵar: Palti’ĕl son of Azzan. 
Num
34:27  “And a leader from the tribe of
the children of Ashĕr: Aḥihuḏ son of Shelomi. 
Num
34:28  “And a leader from the tribe of
the children of Naphtali: Peḏah’ĕl son of Ammihuḏ.” 
Num
34:29  These are the ones יהוה
commanded to divide the inheritance among the children of Yisra’ĕl in the
land of Kena‛an. 
Num
35:1  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh in the desert plains of Mo’aḇ by the Yardĕn of
Yeriḥo, saying, 
Num
35:2  “Command the children of Yisra’ĕl
that they shall give the Lĕwites cities to dwell in from the inheritance
of their possession. Also give the Lĕwites open land around the cities. 
Num
35:3  “And they shall have the cities to
dwell in, and their open land for their cattle, and for their herds, and for
all their livestock. 
Num
35:4  “And the open land of the cities
which you give the Lĕwites are from the wall of the city outward a
thousand cubits all around. 
Num
35:5  “And you shall measure outside the
city on the east side two thousand cubits, and on the south side two thousand
cubits, and on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two
thousand cubits. And the city is in the middle. This is to them the open land
for the cities. 
Num
35:6  “And the cities which you give to
the Lĕwites are the six cities of refuge, which you give to him who killed
someone to flee to, and to these you add forty-two cities. 
Num
35:7  “All the cities which you give to
the Lĕwites are forty-eight, these with their open land. 
Num
35:8  “And the cities which you give are
from the possession of the children of Yisra’ĕl. From the larger tribe you give many, from the smaller
you give few, each one gives some of its cities to the Lĕwites, in
proportion to the inheritance that each inherits.” 
Num
35:9  And יהוה
spoke to Mosheh, saying, 
Num
35:10  “Speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl,
and say to them, ‘When you pass over the Yardĕn into the land of Kena‛an,

Num
35:11  then you shall choose cities to be
cities of refuge for you, that the one who accidentally killed someone shall
flee there. 
Num
35:12  ‘And they shall be cities of
refuge for you from the revenger, and the one who killed someone is not to die
until he stands before the congregation in right-ruling. 
Num
35:13  ‘And of the cities which you give,
six are to be cities of refuge. 
Num
35:14  ‘Give three cities beyond the Yardĕn,
and give three cities in the land of Kena‛an, as cities of refuge. 
Num
35:15  ‘These six cities are for refuge
for the children of Yisra’ĕl, and for the sojourner, and for the settler
in their midst, for anyone who accidentally kills someone to flee there. 
Num
35:16  ‘But if he has smitten him with an
instrument of iron, so that he dies, he is a murderer. The murderer shall
certainly be put to death. 
Num
35:17  ‘And if he has smitten him with a
stone in the hand, by which one could die, and he does die, he is a murderer.
The murderer shall certainly be put to death. 
Num
35:18  ‘Or if he has smitten him with a
wooden instrument that could kill, and he does die, he is a murderer. The
murderer shall certainly be put to death. 
Num
35:19  ‘The revenger of blood himself
puts the murderer to death. When he meets him, he puts him to death. 
Num
35:20  ‘And if he thrusts him through in
hatred, or throws an object at him
while lying in wait, so that he dies, 
Num
35:21  or in enmity he smites him with
his hand so that he dies, the one who smote him shall certainly be put to
death, for he is a murderer. The revenger of blood puts the murderer to death
when he meets him. 
Num
35:22  ‘But if he pushes him suddenly
without enmity, or throws an object
at him without lying in wait, 
Num
35:23  or uses a stone, by which a man
could die, throwing it at him without seeing him, so that he dies, while he was
not his enemy or seeking his harm, 
Num
35:24  then the congregation shall judge
between him who killed someone and the revenger of blood, according to these
right-rulings. 
Num
35:25  ‘And the congregation shall rescue
the one who killed someone from the hand of the revenger of blood, and the
congregation shall return him to the city of refuge where he had fled, and he
shall remain there until the death of the high priest who was anointed with the
set-apart oil. 
Num
35:26  ‘But if the one who killed someone
at any time goes outside the limits of the city of refuge where he fled, 
Num
35:27  and the revenger of blood finds
him outside the limits of his city of refuge, and the revenger of blood kills
him who killed someone, he is not guilty of blood, 
Num
35:28  because he should have remained in
his city of refuge until the death of the high priest. But after the death of
the high priest he who killed someone is to return to the land of his
possession. 
Num
35:29  ‘And these shall be for a law of
right-ruling to you throughout your generations in all your dwellings. 
Num
35:30  ‘Whoever kills someone has to be
put to death as a murderer by the mouth of witnesses, but only one witness does not bear witness against someone to die. 
Num
35:31  ‘And take no ransom for the life
of a murderer who is guilty of death, but he shall certainly be put to death. 
Num
35:32  ‘And take no ransom for him who
has fled to his city of refuge to return to dwell in the land before the death
of the priest. 
Num
35:33  ‘And do not profane the land where
you are, for blood profanes the land, and the land is not pardoned for the
blood that is shed on it, except by the blood of him who shed it. 
Num
35:34  ‘And do not defile the land which
you inhabit, in the midst of which I dwell, for I, יהוה,
am dwelling in the midst of the children of Yisra’ĕl.’ ” 
Num
36:1  And the heads of the fathers of the
clans of the children of Gil‛aḏ, son of Maḵir, son of
Menashsheh, of the clans of the sons of Yosĕph, came near and spoke before
Mosheh and before the leaders, the heads of the fathers of the children of
Yisra’ĕl, 
Num
36:2  and said, “ יהוה
commanded my master to give the land as an inheritance by lot to the children
of Yisra’ĕl, and my master was commanded by יהוה
to give the inheritance of our brother Tselophḥaḏ to his daughters.

Num
36:3  “Now if they are married to any of
the sons of the other tribes of the children of Yisra’ĕl, then their
inheritance shall be taken from the inheritance of our fathers, and shall be
added to the inheritance of the tribe into which they marry, and taken from the
lot of our inheritance. 
Num
36:4  “And if the Jubilee of the children
of Yisra’ĕl takes place, then their inheritance shall be added to the
inheritance of the tribe into which they marry, and their inheritance taken
away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.” 
Num
36:5  And Mosheh commanded the children
of Yisra’ĕl according to the word of יהוה, saying,
“What the tribe of the sons of Yosĕph speaks is right. 
Num
36:6  “This is the word which יהוה
has commanded, for the daughters of Tselophḥaḏ, saying, ‘Let them
marry who is good in their eyes, but let them marry only within the clan of
their father’s tribe.’ 
Num
36:7  “And the inheritance of the
children of Yisra’ĕl is not to change hands from tribe to tribe, for every
one of the children of Yisra’ĕl is to cling to the inheritance of the
tribe of his fathers. 
Num
36:8  “And every daughter possessing an
inheritance in any tribe of the children of Yisra’ĕl is to be the wife of
one of the clan of her father’s tribe, so that the children of Yisra’ĕl
possess each the inheritance of his fathers. 
Num
36:9  “Thus the inheritance is not to
change hands from one tribe to another, but every tribe of the children of
Yisra’ĕl is to cling to its own inheritance.” 
Num
36:10  As יהוה
commanded Mosheh, so did the daughters of Tselophḥaḏ. 
Num
36:11  For Maḥlah, Tirtsah, and Ḥoḡlah,
and Milkah, and No‛ah, the daughters of Tselophḥaḏ, were
married to the sons of their father’s brothers. 
Num
36:12  And they were married into the
clans of the children of Menashsheh, the son of Yosĕph, and their
inheritance remained in the tribe of their father’s clan. 
Num
36:13  These are the commands and the
right-rulings which יהוה commanded the children of Yisra’ĕl
by the hand of Mosheh in the desert plains of Mo’aḇ by the Yardĕn of
Yeriḥo.
