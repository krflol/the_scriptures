Yirmeyahu/Jeremiah
Jer
1:1  The words of Yirmeyahu the son of Ḥilqiyahu,
of the priests who were in Anathoth in the land of Binyamin, 
Jer
1:2  to whom the word of יהוה
came in the days of Yoshiyahu son of Amon, sovereign of Yehuḏah, in the
thirteenth year of his reign. 
Jer
1:3  And it came in the days of
Yehoyaqim, son of Yoshiyahu, sovereign of Yehuḏah, until the end of the
eleventh year of Tsiḏqiyahu, son of Yoshiyahu, sovereign of Yehuḏah,
until the exile of Yerushalayim in the fifth month. 
Jer
1:4  Now the word of יהוה
came to me, saying, 
Jer
1:5  “Before I formed you in the belly I
knew you, and before you came out of the womb I did set you apart – I appointed
you a prophet to nations.” 
Jer
1:6  And said I, “Ah, Master יהוה
! See, I do not know how to speak, for I am a youth.” 
Jer
1:7  And יהוה
said to me, “Do not say, ‘I am a youth,’ but go to all to whom I send you, and
speak whatever I command you. 
Jer
1:8  “Do not fear their faces, for I am
with you to deliver you,” declares יהוה. 
Jer
1:9  Then יהוה
put forth His hand and touched my mouth, and יהוה said
to me, “See, I have put My words in your mouth. 
Jer
1:10  “See, I have this day set you over
the nations and over the reigns, to root out and to pull down, to destroy and
to overthrow, to build and to plant.” 
Jer
1:11  And the word of יהוה
came to me, saying, “What do you see, Yirmeyahu?” And I said, “I see a branch
of an almond tree.” 
Jer
1:12  And יהוה
said to me, “You have seen well, for I am watching over My word to do it.” 
Jer
1:13  And the word of יהוה
came to me a second time, saying, “What do you see?” And I said, “I see a
boiling pot, and it is facing away from the north.” 
Jer
1:14  And יהוה
said to me, “Out of the north evil is set loose on all the inhabitants of the
land. 
Jer
1:15  “For look, I am calling all the
clans of the reigns of the north,” declares יהוה. “And
they shall come and each one set his throne at the entrance of the gates of
Yerushalayim, against all its walls all around, and against all the cities of
Yehuḏah. 
Jer
1:16  “And I shall pronounce My judgments
against them concerning all their evil, because they have forsaken Me, burned
incense to other mighty ones, and bowed themselves to the works of their own
hands. 
Jer
1:17  “Now, gird up your loins and arise,
and speak to them all that I command you. Do not break down before their faces,
lest I break you before them. 
Jer
1:18  “For look, I have made you this day
a walled city and an iron column, and bronze walls against all the land,
against the sovereigns of Yehuḏah, against her heads, against her
priests, and against the people of the land. 
Jer
1:19  “And they shall fight against you,
but not prevail against you. For I am with you,” declares יהוה,
“to deliver you.” 
Jer
2:1  And the word of יהוה
came to me, saying, 
Jer
2:2  “Go, and you shall cry in the
hearing of Yerushalayim, saying, ‘Thus said יהוה, “I
remember you, the kindness of your youth, the love of your bridehood, when you
went after Me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown. 
Jer
2:3  “Yisra’ĕl was set-apart to יהוה,
the first-fruits of His increase. All who ate of it became guilty – evil came
upon them,” declares יהוה.’ ” 
Jer
2:4  Hear the word of יהוה,
O house of Ya‛aqoḇ and all the clans of the house of Yisra’ĕl.

Jer
2:5  Thus said יהוה,
“What unrighteousness have your fathers found in Me, that they have gone far
from Me, and went after worthlessness, and became worthless? 
Jer
2:6  “And did not they say, ‘Where is יהוה,
who brought us up out of the land of Mitsrayim, who led us through the
wilderness, through a land of deserts and pits, through a land of drought and
the shadow of death, a land that no one passed through and where no one dwelt?’

Jer
2:7  “Then I brought you into a garden
land, to eat its fruit and its goodness. But when you entered, you defiled My
land and made My inheritance an abomination. 
Jer
2:8  “The priests did not say, ‘Where is יהוה
?’ And those who handle the Torah did not know Me, and the shepherds transgressed
against Me, and the prophets prophesied by Ba‛al, and walked after matters that did not profit.
Jer
2:9  “Therefore I still contend with you,”
declares יהוה, “and with your children’s children I
contend. 
Jer
2:10  “For, pass beyond the isles of Kittim
and see, and send to Qĕḏar and observe well, and see if there has
been any like this. 
Jer
2:11  “Has a nation changed its mighty
ones, which are not mighty ones? But My people have changed My esteem for that
which does not profit.
Jer
2:12  “Be amazed, O heavens, at this, and
be frightened, be utterly dried up,” declares יהוה. 
Jer
2:13  “For My people have done two evils:
they have forsaken Me, the fountain of living waters, to hew out for themselves
cisterns, cracked cisterns, which do not hold water.
Jer
2:14  “Is Yisra’ĕl a servant? Was he
born in the house? Why is he given to plunder? 
Jer
2:15  “The young lions roared at him,
they growled, and made his land waste; his cities have been burned, without
inhabitant. 
Jer
2:16  “Even the sons of Noph and of
Taḥpanḥes have shaven the crown of your head. 
Jer
2:17  “Have you not done this to
yourself, by forsaking יהוה your Elohim when He led you
in the way? 
Jer
2:18  “And now why take the way to
Mitsrayim, to drink the waters of Shiḥor? Or why take the way to Ashshur,
to drink the waters of the River? 
Jer
2:19  “Your own evil instructs you, and
your backslidings reprove you. Know therefore and see that it is evil and
bitter that you have forsaken יהוה your Elohim, and
that My fear is not in you,” declares the Master יהוה
of hosts. 
Jer
2:20  “For of old you have broken your
yoke and tore of your bonds. And you said, ‘I am not serving You,’ when on every high hill and under
every green tree you lay down, a whore. 
Jer
2:21  “Yet I had planted you a choice
vine, all of it a true seed. How then have you turned before Me into the
degenerate plant of a strange vine? 
Jer
2:22  “Although you wash yourself with
lye, and use much soap, yet your crookedness is ingrained before Me,” declares
the Master יהוה. 
Jer
2:23  “How do you say, ‘I am not defiled,
I have not gone after the Ba‛als’? See your way in the valley, know what
you have done: a swift dromedary breaking loose in her ways, 
Jer
2:24  a wild donkey used to the
wilderness, sniffing the wind in the desire of her being – in her time of
mating, who turns her away? All those who seek her need not weary themselves;
in her month they find her. 
Jer
2:25  “Keep your foot from being bare,
and your throat from thirst. But you said, ‘It is useless, because I love
strangers, and after them I go.’ 
Jer
2:26  “As the thief is ashamed when he is
found out, so is the house of Yisra’ĕl ashamed – they and their sovereigns
and their heads, and their priests and their prophets, 
Jer
2:27  saying to a tree, ‘You are my
father,’ and to a stone, ‘You gave birth to me.’ For they have turned their
back to Me, and not their face. But in the time of their calamity they say, ‘Arise
and save us.’ 
Jer
2:28  “But where are your mighty ones
that you have made for yourselves? Let them arise, see if they save you in the time of your calamity. Because your
mighty ones have become as many as your cities, O Yehuḏah. 
Jer
2:29  “Why do you complain to Me? You all
have transgressed against Me,” declares יהוה. 
Jer
2:30  “In vain have I smitten your
children – they received no instruction. Your sword has devoured your prophets
like a destroying lion. 
Jer
2:31  “O generation, see the word of יהוה
! Have I been a wilderness to Yisra’ĕl, Or a land of darkness? Why do My
people say, ‘We have broken loose; we come to You no more’?
Jer
2:32  “Would a maiden forget her
ornaments, or a bride her headband? Yet My people have forgotten Me, days
without number. 
Jer
2:33  “Why do you embellish your way to
seek love? Therefore you have even taught the evil women your ways. 
Jer
2:34  “Even on your skirts is found the
blood of the lives of the poor innocents. You did not find them breaking in,
but in spite of all these,
Jer
2:35  you say, ‘Because I am innocent,
certainly His displeasure shall turn from me.’ See, I shall bring judgment on
you, because you say, ‘I have not sinned.’ 
Jer
2:36  “Why do you go about so much to
change your way? Even of Mitsrayim you are to be ashamed, as you were ashamed
of Ashshur. 
Jer
2:37  “Even from this one you shall go
forth, with your hands on your head. For יהוה has
rejected those you trust, and you shall not prosper by them. 
Jer
3:1  Elohim
said, “If a man puts away his wife, and she goes from him and becomes another
man’s, does he return to her again? Would not that land be made greatly
unclean? But you have committed whoring with many lovers. And would you return
to Me?” declares יהוה. 
Jer
3:2  “Lift up your eyes to the bare
heights and see: where have you not lain with men? Besides the ways you have
sat for them like an Araḇian in the wilderness. And you made the land
unclean with your whorings and your evil. 
Jer
3:3  “Therefore the showers have been
withheld, and there has been no latter rain. You have had a whore’s forehead,
you refuse to be ashamed. 
Jer
3:4  “Shall you not from now on cry to
Me, ‘My father, You are the guide of my youth? 
Jer
3:5  ‘Does one bear a grudge forever?
Does one keep it to the end?’ See, you have spoken and done the evils that you
could.” 
Jer
3:6  And יהוה
said to me in the days of Yoshiyahu the sovereign, “Have you seen what
backsliding Yisra’ĕl has done? She has gone up on every high mountain and
under every green tree, and there committed whoring. 
Jer
3:7  “And after she had done all these, I
said ‘Return to Me.’ But she did not return. And her treacherous sister Yehuḏah
saw it. 
Jer
3:8  “And I saw that for all the causes
for which backsliding Yisra’ĕl had committed adultery, I had put her away
and given her a certificate of divorce; yet her treacherous sister Yehuḏah
did not fear, but went and committed whoring too. 
Jer
3:9  “And it came to be, through her
frivolous whoring, that she defiled the land and committed adultery with stones
and wood. 
Jer
3:10  “And yet for all this her
treacherous sister Yehuḏah has not turned to Me with all her heart, but
falsely,” declares יהוה. 
Jer
3:11  And יהוה
said to me, “Backsliding Yisra’ĕl has shown herself more righteous than
treacherous Yehuḏah. 
Jer
3:12  “Go and proclaim these words toward
the north, and say, ‘Return, O backsliding Yisra’ĕl,’ declares יהוה,
‘I shall not look on you in displeasure, for I am kind,’ declares יהוה,
‘and I do not bear a grudge forever. 
Jer
3:13  ‘Only, acknowledge your
crookedness, because you have transgressed against יהוה
your Elohim, and have scattered your ways to strangers under every green tree,
and you have not obeyed My voice,’ declares יהוה. 
Jer
3:14  “Return, O backsliding children,”
declares יהוה, “for I shall rule over you, and shall
take you, one from a city and two from a clan, and shall bring you to Tsiyon.
Jer
3:15  “And I shall give you shepherds
according to My heart, and they shall feed you with knowledge and
understanding. 
Jer
3:16  “And it shall be, when you have
increased, and shall bear fruit in the land in those days,” declares יהוה,
“that they no longer say, ‘The ark of the covenant of יהוה.’
Neither would it come to heart, nor would they remember it, nor would they
visit it, nor would it be made again. 
Jer
3:17  “At that time Yerushalayim shall be
called the throne of יהוה, and all the nations shall be
gathered to it, to the Name of יהוה, to Yerushalayim,
and no longer walk after the stubbornness of their evil heart. 
Jer
3:18  “In those days the house of Yehuḏah
shall go to the house of Yisra’ĕl, and they shall come together out of the
land of the north to the land that I have given as an inheritance to your
fathers. 
Jer
3:19  “But I said, ‘How would I put you
among the children and give you a pleasant land, a splendid inheritance of the
hosts of nations?’ “And I said, ‘Call Me, “My Father,” and do not turn away
from Me.’ 
Jer
3:20  “But indeed as a wife betrays her
husband, so have you betrayed Me, O house of Yisra’ĕl,” declares יהוה.

Jer
3:21  A voice was heard on the bare heights,
weeping supplications of the children of Yisra’ĕl, because they have
perverted their way, they have forgotten יהוה their
Elohim. 
Jer
3:22  “Return, O backsliding children, I
shall make your backslidings cease.” “See, we have come to You, for You are יהוה
our Elohim. 
Jer
3:23  “Truly, delusion comes from the
high hills, the noisy throng on the
mountains. Truly, in יהוה our Elohim is the deliverance
of Yisra’ĕl. 
Jer
3:24  “For shame has devoured the labour
of our fathers from our youth, their flocks and their herds, their sons and
their daughters. 
Jer
3:25  “We shall lie down in our shame,
while our reproach covers us. For we have sinned against יהוה
our Elohim, we and our fathers, from our youth even to this day, and have not
obeyed the voice of יהוה our Elohim.”
Jer
4:1  “If you do return, O Yisra’ĕl,”
declares יהוה, “return to Me. And if you remove your
abominations from My presence, and cease straying, 
Jer
4:2  and shall swear, ‘As יהוה
lives,’ in truth, in right-ruling, and in righteousness – then nations shall
bless themselves in Him, and they shall boast in Him!” 
Jer
4:3  For this is what יהוה
said to the men of Yehuḏah and Yerushalayim, “Break up your tillable
ground, and do not sow among thorns. 
Jer
4:4  “Circumcise yourselves unto יהוה,
and take away the foreskins of your hearts, you men of Yehuḏah and
inhabitants of Yerushalayim, lest My wrath come forth like fire and burn, with
none to quench it, because of the evil of your deeds.” 
Jer
4:5  Declare in Yehuḏah and let it
be heard in Yerushalayim, and say, “Blow the ram’s horn in the land. Cry aloud
and say, ‘Gather yourselves, and let us go into the walled city.’ 
Jer
4:6  “Lift up the banner toward Tsiyon.
Be strong, do not stand still! For I am bringing evil from the north, and great
destruction.” 
Jer
4:7  “A lion has come up from his bush,
and the destroyer of nations is on his way. He has set out from his place to
make your land a ruin. Your cities are laid waste, without inhabitant. 
Jer
4:8  “For this, gird yourself with
sackcloth, lament and wail. For the burning displeasure of יהוה
has not turned back from us. 
Jer
4:9  “And in that day it shall be,”
declares יהוה, “that the heart of the sovereign shall
perish, and the heart of the heads. And the priests shall be astonished, and the
prophets wonder.” 
Jer
4:10  Then I said, “Ah, Master יהוה
! Truly, You have greatly deceived this people and Yerushalayim, saying, ‘Peace
is for you,’ whereas the sword reaches to the heart.” 
Jer
4:11  At that time it shall be said to
this people and to Yerushalayim, “A scorching wind of the bare heights blows in
the wilderness toward the daughter of My people, not to fan or to cleanse.
Jer
4:12  “A wind too strong for this shall
come for Me. Now it is I who speak judgments against them. 
Jer
4:13  “See, he comes up like clouds, and
his chariots like a whirlwind. His horses shall be swifter than eagles. Woe to
us, for we shall be ravaged!” 
Jer
4:14  O Yerushalayim, wash your heart
from evil, and be saved. Till when would your wicked thoughts remain within
you? 
Jer
4:15  For a voice is declaring from Dan,
and is proclaiming trouble from Mount Ephrayim: 
Jer
4:16  “Announce to the nations, look,
proclaim against Yerushalayim, that besiegers are coming from a distant land
and raise their voice against the cities of Yehuḏah. 
Jer
4:17  “Like keepers of a field they are
against her all around, because she has rebelled against Me,” declares יהוה.

Jer
4:18  “Your ways and your deeds have
brought this upon you. This is your evil, because it is bitter, because it has
reached into your heart.” 
Jer
4:19  O my inward parts, my inward parts!
I am in pain! O the walls of my heart! My heart pounds in me, I am not silent.
For you have heard, O my being, the sound of the ram’s horn, a shout of battle!
Jer
4:20  Destruction upon destruction is
cried, for all the land is ravaged. Suddenly my tents are ravaged – my curtains
in a moment. 
Jer
4:21  How long shall I see a banner, and
hear the sound of the ram’s horn? 
Jer
4:22  “For My people are foolish, they
have not known Me. They are stupid children, and they have no understanding.
They are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.” 
Jer
4:23  I looked at the earth, and saw it
was formless and empty. And the heavens, they had no light.
Jer
4:24  I looked at the mountains, and saw
they shook, and all the hills were swaying. 
Jer
4:25  I looked, and saw there was no man,
and all the birds of the heavens had fled. 
Jer
4:26  I looked, and saw the garden land
was a wilderness, and all its cities were broken down at the presence of יהוה,
by His burning displeasure. 
Jer
4:27  For thus said יהוה,
“All the earth shall be a ruin, but I shall not make a complete end. 
Jer
4:28  “On account of this, let the earth
mourn and the heavens above be dark, because I have spoken, because I have
purposed and shall not relent, nor do I turn back from it.” 
Jer
4:29  All the city is fleeing from the
noise of the horsemen and bowmen. They shall go into bushes and climb up on the
rocks. All the city is forsaken, and no one is dwelling in it. 
Jer
4:30  And when you are ravaged, what
would you do? Though you put on crimson, though you adorn yourself with
ornaments of gold, though you enlarge your eyes with paint, you adorn yourself
in vain. Your lovers despise you, they seek your life. 
Jer
4:31  For I have heard a voice as of a
woman in labour, the distress as of her who brings forth her first child, the
voice of the daughter of Tsiyon! She bewails herself, she spreads out her
hands, saying, “Woe to me, for my being faints because of murderers!”  
Jer
5:1  “Diligently search the streets of
Yerushalayim, and please look, and know and seek in her open places if you find
a man, if there is anyone doing right-ruling, seeking the truth, then I shall
pardon her. 
Jer
5:2  “Even when they say, ‘As יהוה
lives,’ they swear falsely, for certain.” 
Jer
5:3  O יהוה, are
Your eyes not on truth? You have smitten them, but they have not grieved. You
have consumed them, but they have refused to receive instruction. They made
their faces harder than rock, they refused to turn back. 
Jer
5:4  Then I said, “These are only the
poor. They have been foolish, for they have not known the way of יהוה,
the right-ruling of their Elohim. 
Jer
5:5  “Let me go to the great men and
speak to them, for they have known the way of יהוה, the
right-ruling of their Elohim.” But these have altogether broken the yoke and
torn off the bonds. 
Jer
5:6  Therefore a lion from the forest
shall smite them, a wolf of the deserts ravage them. A leopard is watching over
their cities, whoever comes out of them is torn in pieces. For their
transgressions have been many, their backslidings have been numerous. 
Jer
5:7  “Why should I pardon you for this?
Your children have forsaken Me and sworn by those that are not mighty ones.
When I had filled them up, they then committed adultery and they thronged to
the house of a whore. 
Jer
5:8  “They were like well-fed horses,
every one neighed after his neighbour’s wife. 
Jer
5:9  “Would I not punish them for this?”
declares יהוה. “And would I not revenge Myself on such
a nation as this? 
Jer
5:10  “Go up on her walls and destroy,
but do not make a complete end. Take away her branches, for they do not belong
to יהוה. 
Jer
5:11  “For the house of Yisra’ĕl and
the house of Yehuḏah have utterly betrayed Me,” declares יהוה.

Jer
5:12  They have been untrue to יהוה,
and said, “It is not He. No evil comes upon us, nor do we see sword or scarcity
of food.”
Jer
5:13  And the prophets have become wind,
and the Word is not in them. Thus shall be done to them:
Jer
5:14  Therefore thus said יהוה
Elohim of hosts, “Because you speak this word, see, I am making My words in
your mouth fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour them. 
Jer
5:15  “See, I am bringing a nation
against you from afar, O house of Yisra’ĕl,” declares יהוה.
“It is an enduring nation, it is an ancient nation, a nation whose language you
do not know, nor do you understand what they say. 
Jer
5:16  “Their quiver is like an open tomb,
all of them are mighty men. 
Jer
5:17  “And they shall eat up your harvest
and your bread, which your sons and daughters should eat. They shall eat up
your flocks and your herds, they shall eat up your vines and your fig trees.
With the sword they shall demolish your walled cities, in which you are
trusting. 
Jer
5:18  “But even in those days,” declares יהוה,
“I shall not make a complete end of you. 
Jer
5:19  “And it shall be, when they say, ‘Why
does יהוה our Elohim do all this to us?’ then you shall
answer them, ‘As you have forsaken Me and served foreign mighty ones in your
land, so you shall serve foreigners in a land that is not yours.’ 
Jer
5:20  “Declare this in the house of Ya‛aqoḇ
and proclaim it in Yehuḏah, saying, 
Jer
5:21  ‘Hear this now, O foolish people
without heart, who have eyes and see not, and who have ears and hear not: 
Jer
5:22  ‘Do you not fear Me?’ declares יהוה.
‘Do you not tremble at My presence, who have placed the sand as the boundary of
the sea, by an everlasting law, and it does not pass over it? Though its waves
toss to and fro, they are not able; though they roar, they do not pass over it.

Jer
5:23  ‘But this people has a backsliding
and rebellious heart, they have turned aside and gone away. 
Jer
5:24  ‘And they do not say in their
heart, “Let us now fear יהוה our Elohim, who gives
rain, both the former and the latter, in its season. He guards for us the
appointed weeks of the harvest.” 
Jer
5:25  ‘Your crookednesses have turned
these away, and your sins have kept the good from you. 
Jer
5:26  ‘For among My people are found
wrong men who lie in wait as one who sets snares. They have set up a trap, they
catch men. 
Jer
5:27  ‘As a cage is filled with birds, so
their houses are filled with deceit. Therefore they have become great and grown
rich. 
Jer
5:28  ‘They have become fat, they are
sleek. They also overlook the deeds of the wrong. They did not rightly rule the
cause of the fatherless, so that they prosper. And the right of the needy they
did not rightly rule. 
Jer
5:29  ‘Would I not punish them for this?’
declares יהוה. ‘Would I not revenge Myself on such a
nation as this?’ 
Jer
5:30  “An astounding and horrible matter
has come to be in the land: 
Jer
5:31  The prophets have prophesied
falsely, and the priests rule by their own hand, and My people have loved it
so. And what are you going to do at the end of it?
Jer
6:1  “O children of Binyamin, gather
yourselves to flee out of the midst of Yerushalayim! Blow the ram’s horn in
Teqowa, and set up a signal-fire in Bĕyth Hakkerem, for evil has been seen
from the north, and great destruction. 
Jer
6:2  “I shall cut off the lovely and
delicate one, the daughter of Tsiyon. 
Jer
6:3  “The shepherds with their flocks
shall come to her, they shall pitch their tents against her all around. They
shall pasture, each one in his own place.” 
Jer
6:4  “Set apart battle against her.
Arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe to us, for the day goes away, for the
shadows of the evening are lengthening. 
Jer
6:5  “Arise, and let us go by night, and
let us destroy her palaces.” 
Jer
6:6  For thus said יהוה
of hosts, “Cut down her trees, and cast up a siege mound against Yerushalayim.
She is the city to be punished, in whose midst there is only oppression. 
Jer
6:7  “As a well flows with water, so she
flows with her evil. Violence and destruction are heard in her. Before Me
continually are suffering and smiting. 
Jer
6:8  “Be instructed, O Yerushalayim, lest
My being be torn from you, lest I make you a waste, a land not inhabited.” 
Jer
6:9  Thus said יהוה
of hosts, “Let them thoroughly glean as a vine the remnant of Yisra’ĕl;
pass your hand again over the branches like a grape-gatherer.” 
Jer
6:10  To whom shall I speak and give
warning, so that they hear? See, their ear is uncircumcised, and they are
unable to listen. See, the word of יהוה is a reproach
to them, they do not delight in it. 
Jer
6:11  Therefore I am filled with the
wrath of יהוה. I have become weary of containing it. “Pour
it out on the children outside, and on the company of young men together, for
even husband and wife shall be taken, the aged and the very old. 
Jer
6:12  “And their houses shall be turned
over to others, fields and wives together. For I shall stretch out My hand
against the inhabitants of the land,” declares יהוה. 
Jer
6:13  “For from the least of them even to
the greatest of them, they are all greedy for gain. And from the prophet even
to the priest, all act falsely. 
Jer
6:14  “And they heal the breach of My
people slightly, saying, ‘Peace, peace,’ when there is no peace. 
Jer
6:15  Were they ashamed when they had
done abomination? No! They were not at all ashamed, nor did they know how to
blush. Therefore they shall fall among those who fall. They shall stumble at
the time I visit them,” said יהוה. 
Jer
6:16  Thus said יהוה,
“Stand in the ways and see, and ask for the old paths, where the good way is,
and walk in it; and find rest for yourselves. But they said, ‘We do not walk in it.’ 
Jer
6:17  “And I raised up watchmen over you,
and said, ‘Listen to the sound of the
ram’s horn!’ But they said, ‘We do not listen.’ 
Jer
6:18  “Therefore hear, you nations, and
know, O congregation, what is upon them! 
Jer
6:19  “Hear, O earth! See, I am bringing
evil upon this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not
listened to My words, nor My Torah – and they rejected it. 
Jer
6:20  “What need have I of frankincense
from Sheḇa, and sweet cane from a distant land? Your burnt offerings are
not acceptable, and your slaughterings have not been sweet to Me.” 
Jer
6:21  Therefore thus said יהוה,
“See, I am laying stumbling-blocks before this people. And the fathers and the
sons together shall stumble on them, the neighbour and his friend shall perish.”

Jer
6:22  Thus said יהוה,
“See, a people shall come from the land of the north, and a great nation is
stirred up from the farthest parts of the earth,
Jer
6:23  they seize bow and spear, they are
cruel and have no compassion, their voice roars like the sea. And they ride on
horses, set in array as a man for battle against you, O daughter of Tsiyon.” 
Jer
6:24  We have heard the report of it, our
hands grow weak. Distress has taken hold of us, pain as of a woman in labour. 
Jer
6:25  Do not go out into the field, nor
walk by the way. Because of the sword of the enemy, fear is on every side.
Jer
6:26  O daughter of my people, gird on
sackcloth, and roll about in ashes! Make mourning as for an only son, most
bitter lamentation because suddenly the ravager shall come upon us. 
Jer
6:27  “I have made you a trier and a
stronghold among My people, so that you know, and shall try their way. 
Jer
6:28  “All of them are rebels of rebels,
walking as slanderers. They are bronze and iron, all of them are corrupters. 
Jer
6:29  “The bellows have burned, the lead
has been consumed by fire. The refiner has refined in vain, for those who are
evil have not been seperated. 
Jer
6:30  “They shall call them rejected
silver, because יהוה has rejected them.” 
Jer
7:1  The word that came to Yirmeyahu from
יהוה, saying, 
Jer
7:2  “Stand in the gate of the House of יהוה,
and you shall proclaim there this word, and shall say, ‘Hear the word of יהוה,
all you of Yehuḏah who enter in at these gates to bow before יהוה
!’ ” 
Jer
7:3  Thus said יהוה
of hosts, the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, “Make your ways and your deeds good,
then I let you dwell in this place. 
Jer
7:4  “Do not trust in these false words,
saying, ‘This is the Hĕḵal of יהוה, the Hĕḵal
of יהוה, the Hĕḵal of יהוה
!’ 
Jer
7:5  “For if you truly make your ways and
your deeds good, if you truly do right-ruling between a man and his neighbour, 
Jer
7:6  if you do not oppress the stranger,
the fatherless, and the widow, and do not shed innocent blood in this place, or
walk after other mighty ones to your own evil, 
Jer
7:7  then I shall let you dwell in this
place, in the land that I gave to your fathers forever and ever. 
Jer
7:8  “See, you are trusting in false
words, which do not profit – 
Jer
7:9  stealing, murdering, and committing
adultery, and swearing falsely, and burning incense to Ba‛al, and walking
after other mighty ones you have not known. 
Jer
7:10  “And you came and stood before Me
in this house which is called by My Name, and said, ‘We have been delivered’ –
in order to do all these abominations! 
Jer
7:11  “Has this house, which is called by
My Name, become a den of robbers in your eyes? Look, I, even I Myself have seen
it,” declares יהוה. 
Jer
7:12  “But go now to My place at Shiloh,
where I set My Name at the first, and see what I did to it because of the evil
of My people Yisra’ĕl. 
Jer
7:13  “And now, because you have done all
these works,” declares יהוה, “and I spoke to you,
rising up early and speaking, but you did not hear, and I called you, but you
did not answer, 
Jer
7:14  “I shall also do to this house,
which is called by My Name, in which you trust, and to this place which I gave
to you and your fathers, as I did to Shiloh. 
Jer
7:15  “And I shall cast you out of My
presence, as I have cast out all your brothers, all the seed of Ephrayim. 
Jer
7:16  “And you, do not pray for this
people, nor lift up a cry or prayer for them, nor make intercession to Me, for
I do not hear you. 
Jer
7:17  “Do you not see what they are doing
in the cities of Yehuḏah and in the streets of Yerushalayim? 
Jer
7:18  “The children are gathering wood,
the fathers are lighting the fire, and the women are kneading their dough, to
make cakes for the sovereigness of the heavens, and to pour out drink offerings
to other mighty ones, to provoke Me. 
Jer
7:19  “Is it Me they are provoking?”
declares יהוה. “Is it not themselves – unto the shame
of their own faces?” 
Jer
7:20  Therefore, thus said the Master יהוה,
“See, My displeasure and My wrath is poured out on this place, on man and on
beast, and on the trees of the field and on the fruit of the ground. And it
shall burn and not be quenched.” 
Jer
7:21  Thus said יהוה
of hosts, the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, “Add your burnt offerings to your
slaughterings and eat meat. 
Jer
7:22  “For I did not speak to your
fathers, or command them in the day that I brought them out of the land of
Mitsrayim, about matters of burnt offerings or slaughterings. 
Jer
7:23  “But this word I did command them,
saying, ‘Obey My voice, and I shall be your Elohim, and you be My people. And
walk in all the ways that I have commanded you, so that it be well with you.’
Jer
7:24  “But they did not obey or incline
their ear, but walked in the counsels, in the stubbornness of their evil heart,
and went backward and not forward. 
Jer
7:25  “From the day that your fathers
came out of the land of Mitsrayim until this day, I have even sent to you all
My servants the prophets, daily rising up early and sending them. 
Jer
7:26  “But they did not obey Me or
incline their ear, but stiffened their neck. They did evil, more than their
fathers. 
Jer
7:27  “And you shall speak all these
words to them, though they do not listen to you. And you shall also call to
them, though they do not answer you. 
Jer
7:28  “But you shall say to them, ‘This
is a nation that did not obey the voice of יהוה their
Elohim, nor did they accept instruction. Truth has perished and has been cut
off from their mouth. 
Jer
7:29  ‘Cut off your hair and throw it
away, and take up a lamentation on the bare heights, for יהוה
has rejected and forsaken the generation of His wrath.’ 
Jer
7:30  “For the children of Yehuḏah
have done what is evil in My eyes,” declares יהוה. “They
have set their abominations in the house which is called by My Name, to defile
it. 
Jer
7:31  “And they have built the high
places of Topheth, which is in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, to burn their
sons and their daughters in the fire, which I did not command, nor did it come
into My heart. 
Jer
7:32  “Therefore see, the days are
coming,” declares יהוה, “when it shall no longer be
called Topheth, or the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, but the Valley of
Slaughter, for they shall bury in Topheth until no room is left. 
Jer
7:33  “And the corpses of this people
shall be food for the birds of the heavens and for the beasts of the earth,
with none to frighten them away. 
Jer
7:34  “And in the cities of Yehuḏah
and in the streets of Yerushalayim I shall make to cease the voice of rejoicing
and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the
bride. For the land shall become a waste! 
Jer
8:1  “At that time,” declares יהוה,
“they shall bring the bones of the sovereigns of Yehuḏah, and the bones
of its heads, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and
the bones of the inhabitants of Yerushalayim, out of their graves, 
Jer
8:2  and shall spread them before the sun
and the moon and all the host of the heavens, which they have loved and which
they have served and after which they have walked, which they have sought, and
to which they have bowed themselves. They shall not be gathered nor buried,
they shall be for dung on the face of the earth. 
Jer
8:3  “And death shall be preferred to
life by all the rest of those who remain of this evil people, who remain in all
the places where I have driven them,” declares יהוה of
hosts. 
Jer
8:4  “And you shall say to them, ‘Thus
said יהוה, “Would they fall, and not rise? Does one
turn away and not return? 
Jer
8:5  “Why then has this people,
Yerushalayim, turned away in a continual backsliding? They cling to deceit,
they refuse to turn back. 
Jer
8:6  “I have listened and heard – they do
not speak right. No man has repented of his evil, saying, ‘What have I done?’
They all turned to their own course, like a horse rushing into battle. 
Jer
8:7  “Even a stork in the heavens knows
her appointed times. And a turtledove, and a swallow, and a thrush observe the
time of their coming. But My people do not know the right-ruling of יהוה.

Jer
8:8  “How do you say, ‘We are wise, and
the Torah of יהוה is with us’? But look, the false pen
of the scribe has worked falsehood. 
Jer
8:9  “The wise shall be put to shame,
they shall be broken down and caught. See, they have rejected the Word of יהוה,
so what wisdom do they have? 
Jer
8:10  “Therefore I give their wives to
others, and their fields to possessing ones. For from the least even to the
greatest, they are all greedy for gain. From the prophet to the priest, all act
falsely. 
Jer
8:11  “And they heal the breach of the
daughter of My people slightly, saying, ‘Peace, peace!’ when there is no peace.

Jer
8:12  “Were they ashamed when they had
done abomination? No! They were not at all ashamed, nor did they know how to
blush. So they shall fall among those who fall. They shall stumble in the time
of their visitation,” said יהוה. 
Jer
8:13  “I shall snatch them away,”
declares יהוה. “There are no grapes on the vine, nor
figs on the fig tree, and the leaf has faded. And what I gave them shall pass
away from them.” ’ ” 
Jer
8:14  Why are we sitting still? Gather
yourselves, and let us go into the walled cities, and let us be silent there.
For יהוה our Elohim has let us perish and given us
poisoned water to drink, because we have sinned against יהוה.

Jer
8:15  We looked for peace, but there was
no good; and for a time of healing,
but see – fear! 
Jer
8:16  The snorting of his horses was
heard from Dan. All the land shook at the sound of the neighing of his strong
ones. They came and devoured the land and all that fills it, the city and those
who dwell in it.
Jer
8:17  “For look, I am sending among you
serpents, adders, which have no enchanter, and they shall bite you,” declares יהוה.

Jer
8:18  When in grief I would seek comfort;
my heart is sick within me. 
Jer
8:19  Observe! The voice, the cry of the
daughter of my people from a distant land, “Is יהוה not
in Tsiyon? Is her Sovereign not in her?” “Why have they provoked Me with their
carved images, and with foreign worthlessnesses?” 
Jer
8:20  “The harvest is past, the summer is
ended, and we have not been saved!” 
Jer
8:21  For the breach of the daughter of
my people I have been broken. I have grown sad; astonishment has seized me. 
Jer
8:22  Is there no balm in Gil‛aḏ,
is there no healer there? Why has the healing of the daughter of my people not
come? 
Jer
9:1  Oh, that my head were waters, and my
eyes a fountain of tears, and I would weep day and night for the slain of the
daughter of my people! 
Jer
9:2  Oh, that I had in the wilderness a
lodging place for wayfaring men, and I would leave my people, and go from them!
For they are all adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men. 
Jer
9:3  “And they bend their tongue like a
bow. Falsehood, and not truth, prevails on the earth. For they proceed from
evil to evil, and they have not known Me,” declares יהוה.

Jer
9:4  “Let everyone beware of his
neighbour and not trust any brother. For every brother catches by the heel, and
every neighbour walks with slanderers. 
Jer
9:5  “And everyone deceives his
neighbour, and no one speaks the truth. They have taught their tongue to speak
falsehood, and have wearied themselves to crook. 
Jer
9:6  “You live in the midst of deceit;
through deceit they have refused to know Me,” declares יהוה.

Jer
9:7  Therefore thus said יהוה
of hosts, “See, I shall refine them, and shall try them, for what shall I do
because of the daughter of My people? 
Jer
9:8  “Their tongue is an arrow shot out.
It speaks deceit – speaks peaceably to his neighbour with his mouth, but in his
heart he sets his ambush. 
Jer
9:9  “Would I not punish them for this?”
declares יהוה. “Would I not revenge Myself on such a
nation as this?”
Jer
9:10  “I shall take up a weeping and
wailing for the mountains, and for the pastures of the wilderness a
lamentation, because they have been burned up, without any passing over, nor
has the voice of cattle been heard. Both the birds of the heavens and the
beasts have fled, they have gone. 
Jer
9:11  “And I shall make Yerushalayim a
heap of ruins, a habitation for jackals; and the cities of Yehuḏah I
shall make a waste, without an inhabitant.” 
Jer
9:12  Who is the wise man, that he
understands this? And to whom has the mouth of יהוה
spoken, that he declares it? Why has the land perished, has it been burned up
like a wilderness, with none passing through? 
Jer
9:13  And יהוה
says, “Because they have forsaken My Torah which I set before them, and have
not obeyed My voice, nor walked according to it,
Jer
9:14  but they have walked according to
the stubbornness of their own heart and after the Ba‛als, which their
fathers had taught them.” 
Jer
9:15  Therefore thus said יהוה
of hosts, the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, “See, I am making this people eat
wormwood, and I shall make them drink poisoned water. 
Jer
9:16  “And I shall scatter them among the
gentiles, whom neither they nor their fathers have known. And I shall send a
sword after them until I have consumed them.” 
Jer
9:17  Thus said יהוה
of hosts, “Discern! And call for the mourning women, that they come. And send
for the wise women, that they come. 
Jer
9:18  “And let them hasten and take up a
wailing for us, and let our eyes run with tears and our eyelids gush with
water. 
Jer
9:19  “For a voice of wailing is heard
from Tsiyon, ‘How we are ravaged! We are greatly ashamed, because we have
forsaken the land, because we have been thrown out of our dwellings.’ ” 
Jer
9:20  But hear the word of יהוה,
O women, and let your ear receive the word of His mouth. And teach your
daughters wailing, and each one her neighbour a lamentation. 
Jer
9:21  For death has come through our
windows, has entered our palaces, cutting off the children from the streets,
and the young men from the squares. 
Jer
9:22  Speak, “Thus declares יהוה,
‘The corpses of men shall fall as dung on the face of the field, like cuttings
after the reaper, with none to gather them.’ ” 
Jer
9:23  Thus said יהוה,
“Let not the wise boast in his wisdom, let not the mighty boast in his might,
nor let the rich boast in his riches, 
Jer
9:24  but let him who boasts boast of
this, that he understands and knows Me, that I am יהוה,
doing kindness, right-ruling, and righteousness in the earth. For in these I
delight,” declares יהוה. 
Jer
9:25  “See, the days are coming,”
declares יהוה, “when I shall punish all circumcised
with the uncircumcised – 
Jer
9:26  “Mitsrayim, and Yehuḏah, and
Eḏom, and the children of Ammon, and Mo’aḇ, and all those trimmed
on the edges, who dwell in the wilderness. For all the gentiles are
uncircumcised, and all the house of Yisra’ĕl are uncircumcised in heart!” 
Jer
10:1  Hear the word which יהוה
speaks to you, O house of Yisra’ĕl. 
Jer
10:2  Thus said יהוה,
“Do not learn the way of the gentiles, and do not be awed by the signs of the
heavens, for the gentiles are awed by them.
Jer
10:3  “For the prescribed customs of
these peoples are worthless, for one cuts a tree from the forest, work for the
hands of a craftsman with a cutting tool. 
Jer
10:4  “They adorn it with silver and
gold, they fasten it with nails and hammers so that it does not topple. 
Jer
10:5  “They are like a rounded post, and
they do not speak. They have to be carried, because they do not walk. Do not be
afraid of them, for they do no evil, nor is it in them to do any good.” 
Jer
10:6  There is none like You, O יהוה.
You are great, and great is Your Name in might. 
Jer
10:7  Who would not fear You, O Sovereign
of the nations? For this is Your due, for among all the wise men of the
nations, and in all their reigns, there is none like You. 
Jer
10:8  They are both brutish and foolish,
an instruction of worthlessness is the tree. 
Jer
10:9  Silver is beaten into plates; it is
brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the craftsman and of
the hands of the smith; draped in blue and purple; all of them are the work of
skilled ones. 
Jer
10:10  But יהוה
is truly Elohim. He is the living Elohim and the everlasting Sovereign. At His
wrath the earth shakes, and nations are unable to stand His displeasure. 
Jer
10:11  Say to them this, “The elah that
did not make the heavens and the earth shall perish from the earth and from
under these heavens.”
Jer
10:12  He has made the earth by His
power, He has established the world by His wisdom, and has stretched out the
heavens by His understanding. 
Jer
10:13  When He makes His voice heard,
there is a roaring of waters in the heavens. And He makes vapours rise from the
ends of the earth. The lightnings for rain He has made, and brings wind from
His treasuries.
Jer
10:14  Everyone is brutish in knowledge;
every smith is put to shame by his idol. For his moulded image is falsehood,
and there is no spirit in them. 
Jer
10:15  They are worthless, a work of
mockery. In the time of their punishment they perish. 
Jer
10:16  The Portion of Ya‛aqoḇ
is not like these, for He is the Maker of all, and Yisra’ĕl is the tribe
of His inheritance – יהוה of hosts is His Name. 
Jer
10:17  Gather up your bundle from the
ground, you who live under siege! 
Jer
10:18  For thus said יהוה,
“See, at this time I am hurling out the inhabitants of the land, and shall
distress them, so that they feel it.” 
Jer
10:19  Woe to me for my breaking! My
wound is grievous, but I say, “This is my sickness, and I bear it.
Jer
10:20  “My tent has been ravaged, and all
my cords have been broken. My children have gone from me, and they are no more.
There is no one to pitch my tent any more, or to set up my curtains. 
Jer
10:21  For the shepherds have become
brutish, and they have not sought יהוה. Therefore they
did not understand, and all their flock scattered.”
Jer
10:22  See, it has come, the voice of a
report, and a great shaking out of the land of the north, to make the cities of
Yehuḏah a waste, a habitation of jackals. 
Jer
10:23  O יהוה, I
know the way of man is not in himself, it is not for man who walks to direct
his own steps. 
Jer
10:24  O יהוה,
chastise me, but with right-ruling – not in Your displeasure, lest You bring me
to naught. 
Jer
10:25  Pour out Your wrath on the
gentiles who do not know You, and on the tribes who do not call on Your Name.
For they have eaten up Ya‛aqoḇ, devoured him and consumed him, and
laid waste his home.
Jer
11:1  The word that came to Yirmeyahu
from יהוה, saying, 
Jer
11:2  “Hear the words of this covenant,
and speak to the men of Yehuḏah and to the inhabitants of Yerushalayim. 
Jer
11:3  “And you shall say to them, ‘Thus
said יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, “Cursed is the man
who does not obey the words of this covenant, 
Jer
11:4  which I commanded your fathers in
the day when I brought them out of the land of Mitsrayim, from the iron
furnace, saying, ‘Obey My voice, and you shall do according to all that I
command you, and you shall be My people, and I be your Elohim,’
Jer
11:5  in order to establish the oath
which I have sworn to your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and
honey, as it is this day.” ’ ” And I answered and said, “Amĕn, יהוה.”

Jer
11:6  And יהוה
said to me, “Proclaim all these words in the cities of Yehuḏah and in the
streets of Yerushalayim, saying, ‘Hear the words of this covenant and do them. 
Jer
11:7  ‘For I earnestly warned your
fathers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Mitsrayim, until
this day, rising early and warning, saying, “Obey My voice.” 
Jer
11:8  ‘But they did not obey or incline
their ear, but everyone walked in the stubbornness of his evil heart. So I
brought on them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do,
and they did not do.’ ” 
Jer
11:9  And יהוה
said to me, “There is a conspiracy among the men of Yehuḏah and among the
inhabitants of Yerushalayim. 
Jer
11:10  “They have turned back to the
crookednesses of their forefathers who refused to hear My words, and they have
gone after other mighty ones to serve them. The house of Yisra’ĕl and the
house of Yehuḏah have broken My covenant I made with their fathers.” 
Jer
11:11  Therefore thus said יהוה,
“See, I am bringing evil on them which they are unable to escape. Then they
shall cry out to Me, but I shall not listen to them. 
Jer
11:12  “And the cities of Yehuḏah
and the inhabitants of Yerushalayim shall go and cry out to the mighty ones to
whom they burn incense, but they shall bring no deliverance to them at all in
the time of their evil. 
Jer
11:13  “For your mighty ones have become
as many as your cities, O Yehuḏah. And you have set up as many altars to
shame as there are streets in Yerushalayim – altars to burn incense to Ba‛al.

Jer
11:14  “And you, do not pray for this
people, or lift up a cry or prayer for them, for I do not hear them in the time
that they cry out to Me because of their evil. 
Jer
11:15  “Why should My beloved be in My
house – she has done wickedness with many. And does the set-apart flesh remove
your evil from you? Then you rejoice? 
Jer
11:16  “ יהוה has
named you, ‘Green Olive Tree, Fair, of Goodly Fruit.’ With the noise of a great
sound He has set it on fire, and its branches shall be broken. 
Jer
11:17  “And יהוה of
hosts, who planted you, has spoken evil against you for the evil of the house
of Yisra’ĕl and of the house of Yehuḏah, which they have done
against themselves to provoke Me, by burning incense to Ba‛al.” 
Jer
11:18  And יהוה
made it known to me, and I know it. Then You showed me their deeds. 
Jer
11:19  But I was like a gentle lamb
brought to the slaughter. And I did not know that they had plotted against me,
saying, “Let us destroy the tree with its fruit, and let us cut him off from
the land of the living, and let his name be remembered no more.” 
Jer
11:20  But, O יהוה
of hosts, who judges righteously, who tries kidneys and heart, let me see Your
vengeance upon them, for unto You I have revealed my cause. 
Jer
11:21  “Therefore thus said יהוה
concerning the men of Anathoth who are seeking your life, saying, ‘Do not
prophesy in the Name of יהוה, lest you die by our hand’
– 
Jer
11:22  therefore thus said יהוה
of hosts, ‘See, I am punishing them, the young men shall die by the sword,
their sons and their daughters shall die by scarcity of food. 
Jer
11:23  ‘And there shall be no remnant of
them, for I bring evil on the men of Anathoth – the year of their punishment.’ ”

Jer
12:1  Righteous are You, O יהוה,
when I plead with You. Indeed, let me speak with You about right-rulings. Why
has the way of the wrong prospered? All the workers of treachery are at ease?
Jer
12:2  You have planted them and they have
taken root, they grow and they bear fruit. You are near in their mouth but far
from their kidneys. 
Jer
12:3  But You have known me, O יהוה.
You see me, and You have tried my heart toward You. Draw them away like sheep
for slaughter, and separate them for the day of slaughter. 
Jer
12:4  How long shall the land mourn, and
the plants of every field wither? The beasts and birds are consumed, for the
evil of those who dwell there, because they said, “He does not see our latter
ending.” 
Jer
12:5  “If you have run with the footmen,
and they have wearied you, then how do you contend with horses? And if in the
land of peace, you feel safe, then how do you manage in the Yardĕn jungle?

Jer
12:6  “For even your brothers, the house
of your father, even they have betrayed you, even they have cried aloud after
you. Do not believe them, even though they speak smooth words to you. 
Jer
12:7  “I have forsaken My house, I have
left My inheritance, I have given the beloved of My being into the hand of her
enemies. 
Jer
12:8  “My inheritance has become to Me
like a lion in the forest. It cries out against Me, therefore I have hated it. 
Jer
12:9  “My inheritance is to Me like a
speckled bird of prey, the birds of prey all around are against her. Go, gather
all the beasts of the field, bring them to devour! 
Jer
12:10  “Many shepherds have destroyed My
vineyard, they have trodden My portion under foot, they have made My pleasant
portion become a deserted wilderness.
Jer
12:11  “They have laid it waste – a
waste, it mourns to Me. All the land is laid waste, because no one takes it to
heart. 
Jer
12:12  “The ravagers have come on all the
bare heights in the wilderness, for the sword of יהוה
is devouring from one end of the land to the other end of the land. There is no
peace to any flesh. 
Jer
12:13  “They have sown wheat but reaped
thorns, they have exhausted themselves – they do not profit. And they shall be
ashamed of your harvest because of the burning displeasure of יהוה.”

Jer
12:14  Thus said יהוה,
“As for all My evil neighbours who touch the inheritance which I have caused My
people Yisra’ĕl to inherit; see, I am plucking them out of their land, and
I shall pluck out the house of Yehuḏah from their midst. 
Jer
12:15  “And it shall be, after My
plucking them out, I shall return, and have compassion on them and bring them
back, everyone to his inheritance and everyone to his land. 
Jer
12:16  “And it shall be, if they learn
well the ways of My people, to swear by My Name, ‘As יהוה
lives,’ as they taught My people to swear by Ba‛al, then they shall be
established in the midst of My people. 
Jer
12:17  “But if they do not obey, I shall
pluck up, pluck up and destroy that nation,” declares יהוה.

Jer
13:1  Thus יהוה
said to me, “Go and get yourself a linen girdle, and put it on your loins, but
do not put it in water.” 
Jer
13:2  So I bought a girdle according to
the word of יהוה, and put it on my loins. 
Jer
13:3  And the word of יהוה
came to me the second time, saying, 
Jer
13:4  “Take the girdle that you have
bought, which is on your loins, and arise, go to the Euphrates, and hide it
there in a hole in the rock.” 
Jer
13:5  And I went and hid it by the
Euphrates, as יהוה commanded me. 
Jer
13:6  And it came to be after many days
that יהוה said to me, “Arise, go to the Euphrates, and
take from there the girdle which I commanded you to hide there.” 
Jer
13:7  So I went to the Euphrates and dug,
and I took the girdle from the place where I had hidden it. And there was the
girdle, ruined. It was completely useless. 
Jer
13:8  “And the word of יהוה
came to me, saying, 
Jer
13:9  “Thus said יהוה,
‘Thus I ruin the pride of Yehuḏah and the great pride of Yerushalayim. 
Jer
13:10  ‘This evil people, who refuse to
hear My Words, who walk in the stubbornness of their heart, and walk after
other mighty ones to serve them and to bow themselves to them, is like this
girdle which is completely useless. 
Jer
13:11  ‘For as the girdle clings to the
loins of a man, so I have caused all the house of Yisra’ĕl and all the
house of Yehuḏah to cling to Me,’ declares יהוה, ‘to
become Mine – for a people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for an adorning.
But they did not listen.’ 
Jer
13:12  “And you shall speak to them this
word, ‘Thus said יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, “Every
bottle is to be filled with wine.” ’ And when they say to you, ‘Do we not know
that every bottle should be filled with wine?’ 
Jer
13:13  “Then say to them, ‘Thus said יהוה,
“See, I am filling all the inhabitants of this land, and the sovereigns who sit
on the throne of Dawiḏ, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the
inhabitants of Yerushalayim with drunkenness! 
Jer
13:14  “And I shall dash them one against
another, both the fathers and the sons together,” declares יהוה.
“I do not spare nor pardon nor have compassion, that I should not destroy them.”
’ ” 
Jer
13:15  Listen and give ear, do not be
proud, for יהוה has spoken. 
Jer
13:16  Give esteem to יהוה
your Elohim before He brings darkness, and before your feet stumble on the dark
mountains, and while you are looking for light. He turns it into the shadow of
death, makes it gross darkness. 
Jer
13:17  And if you do not listen, my being
shall weep in secret for your pride, and my eyes bitterly weep and run down
with tears, because the flock of יהוה shall be taken
captive. 
Jer
13:18  Say to the sovereign and to the
sovereigness mother, “Humble yourselves. Sit down, for your rule, the crown of
your comeliness, has come down.” 
Jer
13:19  The cities of the South shall be
shut up, with no one to open them. Yehuḏah shall be taken into exile, all
of it. She shall be taken into exile, completely. 
Jer
13:20  Lift up your eyes and see those
who come from the north. Where is the flock that was given to you, your fair
sheep? 
Jer
13:21  What would you say when He visits
you? For you have taught them to be chiefs, to be head over you. Do not pangs
seize you, like a woman in labour? 
Jer
13:22  And when you say in your heart, “Why
has this come upon me?” It is because of your great crookedness that your
skirts have been uncovered, your heels made bare. 
Jer
13:23  Does a Kushite change his skin and
a leopard its spots? You who are taught to do evil are also unable to do good! 
Jer
13:24  “So I shall scatter them like
stubble that passes away by the wind of the wilderness. 
Jer
13:25  “This is your lot, your measured
portion from Me,” declares יהוה, “because you have
forgotten Me, and trust in falsehood. 
Jer
13:26  “I shall even draw your skirts
over your face, and your shame shall be seen, 
Jer
13:27  your adulteries and your
neighings, the wickedness of your whoring! I have seen your abominations on the
hills in the fields. Woe to you, O Yerushalayim! How long before you would be
made clean?” 
Jer
14:1  The word of יהוה
that came to Yirmeyahu concerning the matter of droughts. 
Jer
14:2  “Yehuḏah has mourned, and her
gates have languished. They have mourned on the ground, and the cry of Yerushalayim
has gone up. 
Jer
14:3  “And their nobles have sent their
little ones for water, they went to the cisterns and found no water, they
returned with their vessels empty. They were put to shame, and blushed and
covered their heads. 
Jer
14:4  “Because the ground became cracked,
for there has been no rain in the land. The ploughmen were put to shame, they
covered their heads. 
Jer
14:5  “Even the deer gave birth in the
field, but left because there was no grass. 
Jer
14:6  “And wild donkeys stood in the bare
heights, they sniffed at the wind like jackals. Their eyes have failed because
there was no grass.” 
Jer
14:7  O יהוה,
though our crookednesses witness against us, act, for Your Name’s sake. For our
backslidings have been many, we have sinned against You. 
Jer
14:8  O Expectation of Yisra’ĕl, its
Saviour in time of distress, why should You be like a stranger in the land, or
like a traveller who turns aside to lodge? 
Jer
14:9  Why should You be as one who is
stunned, as a mighty man that is unable to save? Yet You, O יהוה,
are in our midst, and Your Name has been called on us. Do not leave us! 
Jer
14:10  Thus said יהוה
to this people, “So they have loved to wander, they have not restrained their
feet. Therefore יהוה has not accepted them. Now He does
remember their crookedness and punish their sins.” 
Jer
14:11  And יהוה
said to me, “Do not pray for this people for their good. 
Jer
14:12  “When they fast, I do not hear
their cry. And when they offer burnt offering and grain offering, I do not
accept them. Instead, I am consuming them by sword, and by scarcity of food,
and by pestilence.” 
Jer
14:13  But I said, “Ah, Master יהוה
! See, the prophets say to them, ‘You are not to see a sword, nor have scarcity
of food, for I give you true peace in this place.’ ” 
Jer
14:14  Then יהוה
said to me, “The prophets prophesy falsehood in My Name. I have not sent them,
nor commanded them, nor spoken to them. They are prophesying to you a false
vision, worthless divination, and the deceit of their own heart.
Jer
14:15  “Therefore thus said יהוה
concerning the prophets who prophesy in My Name, whom I did not send, and who
say, ‘Sword and scarcity of food shall not be in this land.’ ‘By sword and
scarcity of food those prophets shall be consumed! 
Jer
14:16  ‘And the people to whom they are
prophesying shall be thrown out in the streets of Yerushalayim because of the
scarcity of food and the sword, with no one to bury them – them nor their
wives, their sons nor their daughters. For I shall pour their evil on them.’ 
Jer
14:17  “And you shall say this word to
them, ‘Let my eyes flow with tears night and day, and let them not cease; for
the maiden daughter of my people has been crushed with a mighty blow, with a
very severe wound. 
Jer
14:18  ‘If I go out to the field, then
see those slain with the sword! And if I enter the city, then see those sick
from scarcity of food! For both prophet and priest go about in a land they do
not know.’ ” 
Jer
14:19  Have You completely rejected Yehuḏah?
Has Your being loathed Tsiyon? Why have You smitten us so that there is no
healing for us? We looked for peace, but there was no good; and for the time of
healing, but see – fear! 
Jer
14:20  O יהוה, we
know our wrong and the crookedness of our fathers, for we have sinned against
You. 
Jer
14:21  Do not scorn us, for Your Name’s
sake. Do not despise the throne of Your esteem. Remember, do not break Your
covenant with us. 
Jer
14:22  Are there among the worthless
idols of the nations any causing rain? And do the heavens give showers? Are You
not He, O יהוה our Elohim? And we wait for You, for You
are the One who does all this. 
Jer
15:1  And יהוה
said to me, “Even if Mosheh and Shemu’ĕl were to stand before Me, My being
is not toward this people. Send them away from My presence, let them go. 
Jer
15:2  “And it shall be, when they say to
you, ‘Where do we go?’ then you shall say to them, ‘Thus said יהוה,
“Those for death, to death. And those for the sword, to the sword. And those for
scarcity of food, to scarcity of food. And those for captivity, to captivity.” ’

Jer
15:3  “And I shall appoint over them four
kinds,” declares יהוה, “the sword to slay, the dogs to
drag, the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the earth to devour and
destroy. 
Jer
15:4  “And I shall make them for a horror
to all the reigns of the earth, on account of Menashsheh son of Ḥizqiyahu,
sovereign of Yehuḏah, because of what he did in Yerushalayim. 
Jer
15:5  “For who has compassion on you, O
Yerushalayim? And who mourns for you? And who turns aside to ask how you are
doing? 
Jer
15:6  “You who have forsaken Me,”
declares יהוה, “you have gone backward. Therefore I
shall stretch out My hand against you and destroy you. I have been weary of
relenting! 
Jer
15:7  “And I shall winnow them with a
winnowing fan in the gates of the land. I shall bereave, I shall destroy My
people. They would not turn back from their ways. 
Jer
15:8  “Their widows shall be more
numerous than the sand of the seas. I shall bring against them, against the
mother of the young men, a ravager at noon. I shall cause agitation and sudden
alarm to fall on her, suddenly. 
Jer
15:9  “She who has borne seven shall pine
away. She shall breathe her last. Her sun shall go down while it is yet day. She
shall be put to shame and be humiliated. And their remnant I give up to the
sword before their enemies,” declares יהוה. 
Jer
15:10  Woe to me, my mother, that you
have borne me, a man of strife and a man of contention to all the earth! I have
neither lent for interest, nor have men lent to me for interest. All of them
are reviling me. 
Jer
15:11  יהוה said,
“Did I not direct you for your good?
Did I not intercede for you in a time of evil and in a time of distress against
the enemy? 
Jer
15:12  “Does one break iron, iron or
bronze from the north? 
Jer
15:13  “Your wealth and your treasures I
give as plunder, not for price, because of all your sins, even in all your
borders. 
Jer
15:14  “And I shall cause them to pass
over with your enemies into a land which you did not know, for a fire is
kindled in My displeasure, which burns upon you.” 
Jer
15:15  You Yourself know, O יהוה.
Remember me and visit me, and take vengeance for me on these who persecute me.
In Your patience, do not take me away. Know that for You I have suffered
reproach. 
Jer
15:16  Your words were found, and I ate
them, and Your word was to me the joy and rejoicing of my heart. For Your Name
is called on me, O יהוה Elohim of hosts. 
Jer
15:17  I have not sat in the company of
the mockers, nor do I exult. I have sat alone because of Your hand, for You
have filled me with displeasure. 
Jer
15:18  Why is my pain without end and my
wound incurable, which refuses to be healed? Are You to me like a failing
stream, as waters not steadfast? 
Jer
15:19  Therefore thus said יהוה,
“If you turn back, then I shall bring you back. Before Me you shall stand. And
if you take out the precious from the worthless, you shall become as My mouth.
Let them return to you, but do not return to them. 
Jer
15:20  “And I shall make you to this
people a strong bronze wall. And they shall fight against you, but not overcome
you. For I am with you to save you and deliver you,” declares יהוה.

Jer
15:21  “And I shall deliver you from the
hand of evil-doers, and I shall ransom you from the grip of the ruthless.” 
Jer
16:1  And the word of יהוה
came to me, saying, 
Jer
16:2  “Do not take a wife, nor have sons
or daughters in this place.” 
Jer
16:3  For thus said יהוה
concerning the sons and daughters who are born in this place, and concerning
their mothers who bear them and their fathers who bring them forth in this
land, 
Jer
16:4  “They shall die of deaths from
diseases, they shall not be lamented nor be buried, but be like dung on the
face of the earth, and be consumed by sword and by scarcity of food. And their
corpses shall be meat for the birds of the heavens and for the beasts of the
earth.” 
Jer
16:5  For thus said יהוה,
“Do not enter the house of mourning, neither go to lament or mourn for them,
for I have withdrawn My peace from this people,” declares יהוה,
“even the kindness and the compassions. 
Jer
16:6  “Both great and small shall die in
this land. They shall not be buried, and no one shall lament for them, or cut
themselves, or make themselves bald for them. 
Jer
16:7  “Neither shall they break bread in
mourning for them to comfort them for the dead, nor give them the cup of
comfort to drink for their father or their mother. 
Jer
16:8  “Do not enter the house of feasting
to sit with them, to eat and drink.” 
Jer
16:9  For thus said יהוה
of hosts, the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, “See, before your eyes and in your days,
I am making the voice of rejoicing and the voice of gladness, the voice of the
bridegroom and the voice of the bride to cease in this place. 
Jer
16:10  “And it shall be, when you declare
to this people all these words, and they shall say to you, ‘Why has יהוה
pronounced all this great evil against us? And what is our crookedness, and
what is our sin that we have committed against יהוה our
Elohim?’ 
Jer
16:11  then you shall say to them, ‘Because
your fathers have forsaken Me,’ declares יהוה, ‘and
have walked after other mighty ones and served them and bowed themselves to
them, and have forsaken Me, and did not guard My Torah. 
Jer
16:12  ‘And you have done more evil than
your fathers, for look, each one walks according to the stubbornness of his own
evil heart, without listening to Me. 
Jer
16:13  ‘So I shall throw you out of this
land into a land that you do not know, neither you nor your fathers. And there
you shall serve other mighty ones day and night, where I show you no favour.’ 
Jer
16:14  “Therefore see, the days are
coming,” declares יהוה, “when it is no longer said, ‘ יהוה
lives who brought up the children of Yisra’ĕl from the land of Mitsrayim,’

Jer
16:15  but, ‘ יהוה
lives who brought up the children of Yisra’ĕl from the land of the north
and from all the lands where He had driven them.’ For I shall bring them back
into their land I gave to their fathers. 
Jer
16:16  “See, I am sending for many
fishermen,” declares יהוה, “and they shall fish them.
And after that I shall send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from
every mountain and every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks. 
Jer
16:17  “For My eyes are on all their
ways; they have not been hidden from My face, nor has their crookedness been
hidden from My eyes. 
Jer
16:18  “And first I shall repay double
for their crookedness and their sin, because they have defiled My land with the
dead bodies of their disgusting matters,
and have filled My inheritance with their abominations.” 
Jer
16:19  O יהוה, my
strength and my stronghold and my refuge, in the day of distress the gentiles
shall come to You from the ends of the earth and say, “Our fathers have
inherited only falsehood, futility, and there is no value in them.”
Jer
16:20  Would a man make mighty ones for
himself, which are not mighty ones? 
Jer
16:21  “Therefore see, I am causing them
to know, this time I cause them to know My hand and My might. And they shall
know that My Name is יהוה !” 
Jer
17:1  “The sin of Yehuḏah is
written with a pen of iron, engraved with the point of a diamond on the tablet
of their heart, and on the horns of your altars, 
Jer
17:2  while their children remember their
altars and their Ashĕrim by the spreading trees on the high hills. 
Jer
17:3  “My mountain in the field, I give
as plunder your wealth, all your treasures, your high places of sin, throughout
all your borders. 
Jer
17:4  “And you, even of yourself, shall
let go of your inheritance which I gave you. And I shall make you serve your
enemies in a land which you have not known, for you have kindled a fire in My
displeasure which burns forever.” 
Jer
17:5  Thus said יהוה,
“Cursed is the man who trusts in man and makes flesh his arm, and whose heart
turns away from יהוה. 
Jer
17:6  “For he shall be like a shrub in
the desert, and not see when good comes, and shall inhabit the parched places
in the wilderness, a salt land that is not inhabited. 
Jer
17:7  “Blessed is the man who trusts in יהוה,
and whose trust is יהוה. 
Jer
17:8  “For he shall be like a tree
planted by the waters, which spreads out its roots by the river, and does not
see when heat comes. And his leaf shall be green, and in the year of drought he
is not anxious, nor does he cease from yielding fruit. 
Jer
17:9  “The heart is crooked above all,
and desperately sick – who shall know it?
Jer
17:10  “I, יהוה,
search the heart, I try the kidneys, and give every man according to his ways,
according to the fruit of his deeds. 
Jer
17:11  “As a partridge that broods but
does not hatch, so is he who gets riches, but not by right. It leaves him in
the midst of his days, and at his end he is a fool.” 
Jer
17:12  An esteemed throne, exalted from
the beginning, is the place of our set-apart place. 
Jer
17:13  O יהוה,
the expectation of Yisra’ĕl, all who forsake You are put to shame. “Those
who depart from Me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken יהוה,
the fountain of living waters.”
Jer
17:14  Heal me, O יהוה,
so that I am healed. Save me, so that I am saved, for You are my praise. 
Jer
17:15  See, they say to me, “Where is the
word of יהוה ? Let it come now!” 
Jer
17:16  And I have not run away from being
a shepherd who follows You, nor have I longed for the desperately sick day. You
Yourself have known, that which came out of my lips was before You. 
Jer
17:17  Do not be a ruin to me, You are my
shelter in the day of evil. 
Jer
17:18  Let these who persecute me be put
to shame, but do not let me be put to shame. Let them be broken, but do not let
me be broken. Bring on them the day of evil, and destroy them with double
destruction! 
Jer
17:19  Thus יהוה
said to me, “Go and stand in the gate of the children of the people, by which
the sovereigns of Yehuḏah come in and by which they go out, and in all
the gates of Yerushalayim. 
Jer
17:20  “And you shall say to them, ‘Hear
the word of יהוה, you sovereigns of Yehuḏah, and
all Yehuḏah, and all the inhabitants of Yerushalayim, who enter by these
gates. 
Jer
17:21  ‘Thus said יהוה,
“Guard yourselves, and bear no burden on the Sabbath day, nor bring it in by
the gates of Yerushalayim, 
Jer
17:22  nor take a burden out of your
houses on the Sabbath day, nor do any work. And you shall set apart the Sabbath
day, as I commanded your fathers. 
Jer
17:23  “But they did not obey, or incline
their ear, and they made their neck stiff not to hear and not to receive
instruction.
Jer
17:24  “And it shall be, if you
diligently obey Me,” declares יהוה, “to bring in no
burden through the gates of this city on the Sabbath day, and set apart the
Sabbath day, to do no work in it, 
Jer
17:25  then sovereigns and heads sitting
on the throne of Dawiḏ shall enter in through the gates of this city,
riding in chariots and on horses, they and their heads – the men of Yehuḏah
and the inhabitants of Yerushalayim. And this city shall be inhabited forever. 
Jer
17:26  “And they shall come from the
cities of Yehuḏah and from the places around Yerushalayim, and from the
land of Binyamin and from the low country, from the mountains and from the
South, bringing burnt offerings and slaughterings, grain offerings and incense,
bringing offerings of praise to the House of יהוה. 
Jer
17:27  “But if you do not obey Me to set
apart the Sabbath day, and not to bear a burden when entering the gates of
Yerushalayim on the Sabbath day, then I shall kindle a fire in its gates, and
it shall consume the palaces of Yerushalayim, and not be quenched.” ’ ” 
Jer
18:1  The word which came to Yirmeyahu
from יהוה, saying, 
Jer
18:2  “Arise, and go down to the potter’s
house, and there I let you hear My words.” 
Jer
18:3  So I went down to the potter’s
house, and saw him doing a piece of work on the wheel. 
Jer
18:4  And the vessel that he made of clay
was ruined in the hand of the potter, so he remade it into another vessel, as
it seemed good to the potter to do. 
Jer
18:5  Then the word of יהוה
came to me, saying, 
Jer
18:6  “O house of Yisra’ĕl, am I not
able to do with you as this potter?” declares יהוה. “Look,
as the clay is in the hand of the potter, so are you in My hand, O house of
Yisra’ĕl! 
Jer
18:7  “The moment I speak concerning a
nation and concerning a reign, to pluck up, to pull down, and to destroy it, 
Jer
18:8  and that nation shall turn from its
evil because I have spoken against it, then I shall repent of the evil that I
thought to do to it. 
Jer
18:9  “And the moment I speak concerning
a nation and concerning a reign, to build and to plant it, 
Jer
18:10  and it shall do evil in My eyes in
not obeying My voice, then I shall repent concerning the good with which I
spoke of doing to it. 
Jer
18:11  “And now, speak to the men of Yehuḏah
and to the inhabitants of Yerushalayim, saying, ‘Thus said יהוה,
“See, I am forming evil and devising a plan against you. Return now every one
from his evil way, and make your ways and your deeds good.” ’ ” 
Jer
18:12  But they shall say, “It is no use!
For we walk according to our own plans, and we do each one the stubbornness of
his evil heart.”
Jer
18:13  Therefore thus said יהוה,
“Ask now among the nations, who has heard the like of this? The maiden of Yisra’ĕl
has done what is most horrible. 
Jer
18:14  “Does the snow of Leḇanon
cease from the rock of the field? Or the cool flowing waters from afar dry up? 
Jer
18:15  “But My people have forgotten Me,
they have burned incense to what is false, and they have stumbled from their
ways, from the ancient paths, to walk in bypaths and not on a highway, 
Jer
18:16  to make their land become a ruin,
a hissing forever – everyone who passes by it is appalled and shakes his head. 
Jer
18:17  “I shall scatter them as with an
east wind before the enemy; I shall show them the back and not the face in the
day of their calamity.” 
Jer
18:18  Then they said, “Come and let us
devise plans against Yirmeyahu, for the Torah shall not perish from the priest,
nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come and let us smite
him with the tongue, and let us not listen to any of his words.” 
Jer
18:19  Attend to me, O יהוה,
and listen to the voice of my adversaries! 
Jer
18:20  Should good be repaid with evil?
For they have dug a pit for my life. Remember that I stood before You to speak
good for them, and to turn away Your wrath from them. 
Jer
18:21  So give their children over to
scarcity of food, and hand them over to the power of the sword. Let their wives
become widows and bereaved of their children. Let their men be put to death,
their young men be smitten by the sword in battle.
Jer
18:22  Let a cry be heard from their
houses, when You bring a raiding party suddenly upon them. For they have dug a
pit to take me, and laid snares for my feet. 
Jer
18:23  But You, O יהוה,
You know all their counsel against me, to slay me. Do not pardon their
crookedness, nor blot out their sin from Your presence, and let them be
overthrown before You. Deal with them in the time of Your displeasure. 
Jer
19:1  Thus said יהוה,
“Go and get a potter’s earthen jug, and take some of the elders of the people
and some of the elders of the priests. 
Jer
19:2  “Then you shall go out to the
Valley of the Son of Hinnom, which is by the entry of the Potsherd Gate, and
shall proclaim there the words that I speak to you, 
Jer
19:3  and shall say, ‘Hear the word of יהוה,
O sovereigns of Yehuḏah and inhabitants of Yerushalayim. Thus said יהוה
of hosts, the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, “See, I am bringing evil on this place,
that makes the ears tingle of all who hear it. 
Jer
19:4  “Because they have forsaken Me and
have profaned this place, and have burned incense in it to other mighty ones
whom neither they, their fathers, nor the sovereigns of Yehuḏah have
known, and they have filled this place with the blood of the innocents, 
Jer
19:5  and have built the high places of
Ba‛al, to burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings to Ba‛al,
which I did not command or speak, nor did it come into My heart. 
Jer
19:6  “Therefore see, the days are
coming,” declares יהוה, “that this place shall no more
be called Topheth or the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, but rather the Valley of Slaughter. 
Jer
19:7  “And I shall pour out the counsel
of Yehuḏah and Yerushalayim in this place, and I shall make them fall by
the sword before their enemies and by the hands of those who seek their lives.
And I shall give their corpses as meat for the birds of the heavens and for the
beasts of the earth. 
Jer
19:8  “And I shall make this city a ruin,
and a hissing – everyone who passes by it is appalled and hisses because of all
its plagues. 
Jer
19:9  “And I shall make them to eat the
flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters, and eat one another’s
flesh in the siege and in the distress with which their enemies and those who
seek their lives distress them.” ’ 
Jer
19:10  “And you shall break the jug
before the eyes of the men who go with you, 
Jer
19:11  and shall say to them, ‘Thus said יהוה
of hosts, “Even so I break this people and this city, as one breaks a potter’s
vessel, which one is unable to repair again. And let them bury them in Topheth
till there is no place to bury. 
Jer
19:12  “This is what I shall do to this
place,” declares יהוה, “and to its inhabitants, so as
to make this city like Topheth. 
Jer
19:13  “And the houses of Yerushalayim
and the houses of the sovereigns of Yehuḏah shall be as unclean as the
place of Topheth, because of all the houses on whose roofs they have burned
incense to all the host of the heavens, and poured out drink offerings to other
mighty ones.” ’ ” 
Jer
19:14  And when Yirmeyahu returned from
Topheth, where יהוה had sent him to prophesy, he stood
in the courtyard of the House of יהוה and said to all
the people, 
Jer
19:15  “Thus said יהוה
of hosts, the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, ‘See, I am bringing on this city and on
all her towns all the evil that I have pronounced against it, because they have
stiffened their necks so as not to hear My words.’ ” 
Jer
20:1  And Pashhur son of Immĕr, the
priest who was also chief governor in the House of יהוה,
heard that Yirmeyahu prophesied these words, 
Jer
20:2  And Pashhur smote Yirmeyahu the
prophet, and put him in the stocks that were in the high gate of Binyamin,
which was by the House of יהוה. 
Jer
20:3  And it came to be on the next day
that Pashhur brought Yirmeyahu out of the stocks, and Yirmeyahu said to him, “ יהוה
has not called your name Pashhur, but Maḡor-Missaḇiḇ. 
Jer
20:4  “For thus said יהוה,
‘See, I am making you a fear to yourself and to all your friends. And they
shall fall by the sword of their enemies, while your eyes see it. And I shall
give all Yehuḏah into the hand of the sovereign of Baḇel, and he
shall exile them to Baḇel and slay them with the sword. 
Jer
20:5  ‘And I shall give all the wealth of
this city and all its labour, and all its valuables, and all the treasures of
the sovereigns of Yehuḏah, I give into the hand of their enemies, who
shall plunder them, seize them, and shall bring them to Baḇel. 
Jer
20:6  ‘And you, Pashhur, and all who
dwell in your house, shall go into captivity, and enter into Baḇel. And
there you shall die, and be buried there, you and all your friends, to whom you
have prophesied falsehood.’ ” 
Jer
20:7  O יהוה, You
enticed me, and I was enticed. You are stronger than I, and have prevailed. I
have been ridiculed all day long, everyone mocks me. 
Jer
20:8  For when I speak, I cry out,
proclaiming violence and ruin. Because the word of יהוה
was made to me a reproach and a derision daily. 
Jer
20:9  Whenever I said, “Let me not
mention Him, nor speak in His Name again,” it was in my heart like a burning
fire shut up in my bones. And I became weary of holding it back, and was
helpless. 
Jer
20:10  For I heard many mocking, “Fear on
every side!” “Expose,” they say, “yea, let us expose him!” All my friends
watched for my stumbling, saying, “He
might be lured away, so that we prevail against him, and take our revenge on
him.” 
Jer
20:11  But יהוה is
with me like a mighty, awesome one. Therefore my persecutors shall stumble, and
not prevail. They shall be greatly ashamed, for they have not acted wisely – an
everlasting reproach never to be forgotten. 
Jer
20:12  But, O יהוה
of hosts, trying the righteous, and seeing the kidneys and heart, let me see
Your vengeance on them, for I have revealed my cause to You. 
Jer
20:13  Sing to יהוה
! Praise יהוה ! For He has delivered the being of the
poor from the hand of evil ones. 
Jer
20:14  Cursed be the day in which I was
born! Let the day not be blessed in which my mother bore me! 
Jer
20:15  Let the man be cursed who brought
news to my father, saying, “A male child has been born to you,” making him very
glad. 
Jer
20:16  And let that man be like the
cities which יהוה overthrew, and repented not. Let him
hear the cry in the morning and the shouting at noon, 
Jer
20:17  because I was not slain from the
womb, so that my mother should have been my grave and her womb forever great. 
Jer
20:18  Why did I come forth from the womb
to see toil and sorrow, and spend my days in shame? 
Jer
21:1  The word that came to Yirmeyahu
from יהוה when Sovereign Tsiḏqiyahu sent to him
Pashhur son of Malkiyah, and Tsephanyah the son of Ma‛asĕyah, the
priest, saying, 
Jer
21:2  “Please inquire of יהוה
on our behalf, for Neḇuḵaḏretstsar sovereign of Baḇel
has started fighting against us. It
might be that יהוה deals with us according to all His
wondrous works, so that he withdraws from us.” 
Jer
21:3  But Yirmeyahu said to them, “Say this
to Tsiḏqiyahu, 
Jer
21:4  ‘Thus said יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, “See, I am turning back the weapons of battle that are
in your hands, with which you fight against the sovereign of Baḇel and
the Chaldeans who besiege you outside the wall. And I shall gather them inside
this city.  
Jer
21:5  “And I Myself shall fight against
you with an outstretched hand, and with a strong arm, even in displeasure and
rage and great wrath. 
Jer
21:6  “And I shall smite the inhabitants
of this city, both man and beast – let them die of a great pestilence. 
Jer
21:7  “And afterward,” declares יהוה,
“I give Tsiḏqiyahu sovereign of Yehuḏah, his servants and the
people, and such as are left in this city from the pestilence and the sword and
the scarcity of food, into the hand of Neḇuḵaḏretstsar
sovereign of Baḇel, into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of
those who seek their life. And he shall smite them with the edge of the sword.
He shall not pardon them, nor spare nor have compassion.” ’ 
Jer
21:8  “You shall also say to this people,
‘Thus said יהוה, “See, I set before you the way of life
and the way of death. 
Jer
21:9  “Whoever stays in this city dies by
the sword, by scarcity of food, and by pestilence. But whoever goes out and
shall go over to the Chaldeans who besiege you, is going to live, and his life
shall be as a prize to him. 
Jer
21:10  “For I have set My face against
this city for evil and not for good,” declares יהוה. “It
is given into the hand of the sovereign of Baḇel, and he shall burn it
with fire.” ’ 
Jer
21:11  “And to the house of the sovereign
of Yehuḏah, say, ‘Hear the word
of יהוה, 
Jer
21:12  ‘O house of Dawiḏ! Thus said
יהוה, “Render right-ruling in the morning, and deliver
him who has been robbed out of the hand of the oppressor, lest My wrath go out
like fire and burn, with no one to quench it, because of the evil of your
deeds. 
Jer
21:13  “See, I am against you, O
inhabitant of the valley, rock of the plain,” declares יהוה,
“who are saying, ‘Who would come down against us? And who would come into our
dwellings?’ 
Jer
21:14  “And I shall punish you according
to the fruit of your deeds,” declares יהוה. “And I
shall kindle a fire in its forest, and it shall consume all that is around her.”
’ ” 
Jer
22:1  Thus said יהוה,
“Go down to the house of the sovereign of Yehuḏah. And there you shall
speak this word, 
Jer
22:2  and shall say, ‘Hear the word of יהוה,
O sovereign of Yehuḏah, you who sit on the throne of Dawiḏ, you and
your servants and your people who enter these gates! 
Jer
22:3  ‘Thus said יהוה,
“Do right-ruling and righteousness, and deliver him who is robbed out of the
hand of the oppressor. Do not maltreat nor do violence to the stranger, the
fatherless, or the widow, nor shed innocent blood in this place. 
Jer
22:4  “For if you certainly do this word,
then there shall enter in by the gates of this house sovereigns sitting on the
throne of Dawiḏ, riding on horses and in chariots, he and his servants
and his people. 
Jer
22:5  “But if you do not obey these
words, I swear by Myself,” declares יהוה, “that this
house shall become a ruin.” ’ ” 
Jer
22:6  For thus said יהוה
to the house of the sovereign of Yehuḏah, “You are like Gil‛aḏ to Me, the head of Leḇanon. But I
shall make you a wilderness, and cities which are not inhabited. 
Jer
22:7  “And I shall prepare destroyers
against you, each with his weapons. And they shall cut down your choice cedars
and throw them into the fire. 
Jer
22:8  “And many gentiles shall pass by
this city, and they shall say to one another, ‘Why has יהוה
done so to this great city?’ 
Jer
22:9  “Then they shall say, ‘Because they
have forsaken the covenant of יהוה their Elohim, and
bowed themselves to other mighty ones and served them.’ ” 
Jer
22:10  Do not weep for the dead, nor
mourn for him. Weep bitterly for him who goes away, for he shall never come
back nor see the land of his birth. 
Jer
22:11  For thus said יהוה
concerning Shallum son of Yoshiyahu, sovereign of Yehuḏah, who reigned
instead of Yoshiyahu his father, who went from this place, “He shall never come
back, 
Jer
22:12  but he shall die in the place
where they have exiled him, and not see this land again. 
Jer
22:13  “Woe to him who builds his house
without righteousness and his rooms without right-ruling, who uses his
neighbour’s service without wages and does not give him his wages, 
Jer
22:14  who says, ‘I am going to build
myself a wide house with spacious rooms, and cut out windows for it, panelling
it with cedar and painting it in red.’ 
Jer
22:15  “Do you reign because you enclose
yourself in cedar? Did not your father eat and drink, and do right-ruling and
righteousness? Then it was well with him. 
Jer
22:16  “He defended the cause of the poor
and needy – then it was well. Was this not to know Me?” declares יהוה.

Jer
22:17  “But your eyes and your heart are
only upon your own greedy gain, and on shedding innocent blood, and on
oppression and on doing violence.” 
Jer
22:18  Therefore thus said יהוה
concerning Yehoyaqim son of Yoshiyahu, sovereign of Yehuḏah, “Let them
not lament for him: ‘Alas, my brother!’ or ‘Alas, my sister!’ Let them not
lament for him: ‘Alas, master!’ or ‘Alas, his excellency!’ 
Jer
22:19  “He shall be buried with the
burial of a donkey, dragged and thrown outside the gates of Yerushalayim. 
Jer
22:20  “Go up to Leḇanon, and cry
out, and lift up your voice in Bashan. And cry from Aḇarim, for all your
lovers are destroyed. 
Jer
22:21  “I have spoken to you in your
ease, but you said, ‘I do not listen.’ This has been your way from your youth,
for you did not obey My voice. 
Jer
22:22  “Let all your shepherds be
devoured by the wind, and your lovers go into captivity. Then you shall be
ashamed and humiliated for all your evil. 
Jer
22:23  “You who dwell in Leḇanon,
being nested in the cedars, how you shall groan when pangs come upon you, like
the pains of a woman giving birth! 
Jer
22:24  “As I live,” declares יהוה,
“though Konyahu son of Yehoyaqim, sovereign of Yehuḏah, were the signet
on My right hand, I would still pull you off from there; 
Jer
22:25  and I shall give you into the hand
of those who seek your life, and into the hand of those whose face you fear,
into the hand of Neḇuḵaḏretstsar sovereign of Baḇel and
the hand of the Chaldeans. 
Jer
22:26  “And I shall hurl you out, and
your mother who bore you, into another land where you were not born, and there
you shall die. 
Jer
22:27  “But they shall not return to the
land to which their being yearns to return. 
Jer
22:28  “Is this man Konyahu a despised
broken pot, or an undesirable vessel? Why are they hurled out, he and his
descendants, and cast into a land which they do not know? 
Jer
22:29  “O land, land, land! Hear the word
of יהוה ! 
Jer
22:30  “Thus said יהוה,
‘Write this man down as childless, a strong man who is not to prosper in his
days, for none of his descendants shall prosper, sitting on the throne of Dawiḏ,
or rule any more in Yehuḏah.’ ” 
Jer
23:1  “Woe to the shepherds destroying
and scattering the sheep of My pasture!” declares יהוה.
Jer
23:2  Therefore thus said יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl against the shepherds who feed My people, “You have
scattered My flock, driven them away, and have not tended them. See, I am
punishing you for the evil of your deeds,” declares יהוה.

Jer
23:3  “Therefore I shall gather the
remnant of My flock out of all the lands where I have driven them, and shall
bring them back to their fold. And they shall bear and increase. 
Jer
23:4  “And I shall raise up shepherds
over them, and they shall feed them. And they shall fear no more, nor be
discouraged, nor shall they be lacking,” declares יהוה.
Jer
23:5  “See, the days are coming,”
declares יהוה, “when I shall raise for Dawiḏ a
Branch of righteousness, and a Sovereign shall reign and act wisely, and shall
do right-ruling and righteousness in the earth.
Jer
23:6  “In His days Yehuḏah shall be
saved, and Yisra’ĕl dwell safely. And this is His Name whereby He shall be
called: ‘ יהוה our Righteousness.’ 
Jer
23:7  “Therefore, see, the days are
coming,” declares יהוה, “when they shall say no more, ‘As
יהוה lives who brought up the children of Yisra’ĕl
out of the land of Mitsrayim,’ 
Jer
23:8  but, ‘As יהוה
lives who brought up and led the seed of the house of Yisra’ĕl out of the
land of the north and from all the lands where I had driven them.’ And they
shall dwell on their own soil.” 
Jer
23:9  My heart within me is broken
because of the prophets; all my bones shake. I am like a drunken man, and like
a man overcome by wine, because of יהוה, and because of
His set-apart words. 
Jer
23:10  For the land is filled with
adulterers; for the land mourns because of a curse. The pastures of the
wilderness are dried up. And their course is evil, and their might is not
right.
Jer
23:11  “For both prophet and priest have
become defiled. Even in My house I have found their evil,” declares יהוה.

Jer
23:12  “Therefore their way is to them
like slippery ways in the dark. They are driven on and they shall fall in them.
For I bring evil on them, the year of their punishment,” declares יהוה.

Jer
23:13  “And I have seen folly in the
prophets of Shomeron: they prophesied by Ba‛al and led My people Yisra’ĕl
astray. 
Jer
23:14  “And among the prophets of
Yerushalayim I have seen a horrible matter: committing adultery and walking in
falsehood. And they strengthen the hands of evil ones, so that no one turns
back from his evil. All of them are like Seḏom to Me, and her inhabitants
like Amorah. 
Jer
23:15  “Therefore thus said יהוה
of hosts concerning the prophets, ‘See, I am making them eat wormwood, and
shall make them drink poisoned water. For defilement has gone out into all the
land from the prophets of Yerushalayim.’ ” 
Jer
23:16  Thus said יהוה
of hosts, “Do not listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you, they
lead you astray. They speak a vision of their own heart, not from the mouth of יהוה.

Jer
23:17  “They keep on saying to those who
despise Me, ‘ יהוה has said you shall have peace.’ And
to all who walk according to the stubbornness of their own heart they say, ‘No evil comes upon you.’ ” 
Jer
23:18  For who has stood in the counsel
of יהוה, and has seen and heard His word? Who has
listened to His word and obeyed it? 
Jer
23:19  See, a storm of יהוה
shall go forth in a rage, a whirling storm! It whirls on the head of the wrong.

Jer
23:20  The displeasure of יהוה
shall not turn back until He has done and established the purposes of His
heart. In the latter days you shall understand it perfectly.
Jer
23:21  “I did not send these prophets,
yet they ran. I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied.
Jer
23:22  “But if they had stood in My
counsel, then they would have let My people hear My Words, and they would have
turned them from their evil way and from the evil of their deeds. 
Jer
23:23  “Am I an Elohim close by,”
declares יהוה, “and not an Elohim afar off? 
Jer
23:24  “If anyone is hidden in secret
places, would I not see him?” declares יהוה. “Do I not
fill the heavens and earth?” declares יהוה. 
Jer
23:25  “I have heard what the prophets
have said who prophesy falsehood in My Name, saying, ‘I have dreamed, I have
dreamed!’ 
Jer
23:26  “Till when shall it be in the
heart of the prophets? – the prophets of falsehood and prophets of the deceit
of their own heart, 
Jer
23:27  who try to make My people forget
My Name by their dreams which everyone relates to his neighbour, as their
fathers forgot My Name for Ba‛al. 
Jer
23:28  “The prophet who has a dream, let
him relate the dream, and he who has My Word, let him speak My Word in truth.
What is the chaff to the wheat?” declares יהוה. 
Jer
23:29  “Is not My Word like a fire?”
declares יהוה, “and like a hammer that shatters a rock?

Jer
23:30  “Therefore see, I am against the
prophets,” declares יהוה, “who steal My Words every one
from his neighbour. 
Jer
23:31  “See, I am against the prophets,”
declares יהוה, “who use their tongues and say, ‘He
declares.’ 
Jer
23:32  “See, I am against those who
prophesy false dreams,” declares יהוה, “and relate
them, and lead My people astray by their falsehoods and by their reckless
boasting. But I Myself did not send them nor have I commanded them. And they do
not profit this people at all,” declares יהוה. 
Jer
23:33  “And when these people or the
prophet or the priest ask you, saying, ‘What is the message of יהוה
?’ then you shall say to them, ‘What message?’ I shall forsake you,” declares יהוה.

Jer
23:34  “As for the prophet and the priest
and the people who say, ‘The message of יהוה,’ I shall
punish that man and his house. 
Jer
23:35  “This is what each one says to his
neighbour, and each one to his brother, ‘What has יהוה
answered?’ and, ‘What has יהוה spoken?’ 
Jer
23:36  “But the message of יהוה
you no longer remember! For every man’s message is his own word, for you have
changed the Words of the living Elohim, יהוה of hosts,
our Elohim!
Jer
23:37  “This is what you say to the prophet,
‘What has יהוה answered you?’ and, ‘What has יהוה
spoken?’ 
Jer
23:38  “But since you say, ‘The message
of יהוה !’ therefore thus said יהוה,
‘Because you say this word, “The message of יהוה !” and
I have sent to you, saying, “Do not say, ‘The message of יהוה
!’ ” 
Jer
23:39  therefore see, I, I shall utterly
forget you and cast you away from My presence, along with the city that I gave
you and your fathers. 
Jer
23:40  ‘And I shall put an everlasting
reproach on you, and an everlasting shame that is not forgotten.’ ” 
Jer
24:1  יהוה showed
me, and look, there were two baskets of figs set before the Hĕḵal of
יהוה, after Neḇuḵaḏrets-tsar
sovereign of Baḇel had exiled Yeḵonyahu son of Yehoyaqim, sovereign
of Yehuḏah, and the heads of Yehuḏah with the craftsmen and smiths,
from Yerushalayim, and had brought them to Baḇel. 
Jer
24:2  One basket had very good figs, like
the figs that are first ripe. And the other basket had very spoilt figs which
could not be eaten, they were so spoilt.” 
Jer
24:3  And יהוה said
to me, “What do you see, Yirmeyahu?” And I said, “Figs, the good figs, very
good. And the spoilt, very spoilt, which could not be eaten, they are so
spoilt.” 
Jer
24:4  Again the word of יהוה
came to me, saying, 
Jer
24:5  “Thus said יהוה,
the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, ‘Like these good figs, so do I acknowledge the
exiles of Yehuḏah, whom I have sent out of this place for their own good,
into the land of the Chaldeans. 
Jer
24:6  ‘And I shall set My eyes on them
for good, and shall bring them back to this land. And I shall build them and
not pull them down, and shall plant them and not pluck them up. 
Jer
24:7  ‘And I shall give them a heart to
know Me, that I am יהוה. And they shall be My people
and I shall be their Elohim, for they shall turn back to Me with all their
heart. 
Jer
24:8  ‘And as the spoilt figs that could
not be eaten because they are so spoilt,’ for thus said יהוה,
‘so do I give up Tsiḏqiyahu, the sovereign of Yehuḏah, his heads,
the rest of Yerushalayim who remain in this land, and those who dwell in the
land of Mitsrayim. 
Jer
24:9  ‘And I shall make them a horror to
all the reigns of the earth, for evil, to be a reproach and a byword, a mockery
and a curse, in all the places to which I drive them. 
Jer
24:10  ‘And I shall send the sword, the
scarcity of food, and the pestilence among them, till they are consumed from
the land that I gave to them and their fathers.’ ” 
Jer
25:1  The word that came to Yirmeyahu
concerning all the people of Yehuḏah, in the fourth year of Yehoyaqim son
of Yoshiyahu, the sovereign of Yehuḏah, which was the first year of Neḇuḵaḏretstsar
sovereign of Baḇel, 
Jer
25:2  which Yirmeyahu the prophet spoke
to all the people of Yehuḏah and to all the inhabitants of Yerushalayim,
saying, 
Jer
25:3  “From the thirteenth year of
Yoshiyahu son of Amon, sovereign of Yehuḏah, even to this day, this is
the twenty-third year in which the word of יהוה has
come to me. And I have spoken to you, rising early and speaking, but you have
not listened. 
Jer
25:4  “Moreover, יהוה
has sent to you all His servants the prophets, rising early and sending them,
but you have not listened nor inclined your ear to hear, 
Jer
25:5  saying, ‘Turn back now everyone
from his evil way and from the evil of your deeds, and dwell on the soil which יהוה
has given to you and your fathers forever and ever. 
Jer
25:6  ‘And do not go after other mighty
ones to serve them and to bow down to them. And do not provoke Me with the
works of your hands, so that I do you no evil.’ 
Jer
25:7  “But you did not listen to Me,”
declares יהוה, “so as to provoke Me with the works of
your hands, for your own evil. 
Jer
25:8  “Therefore thus said יהוה
of hosts, ‘Because you did not obey My words, 
Jer
25:9  see, I am sending and taking all
the tribes of the north,’ declares יהוה, ‘and Neḇuḵaḏretstsar
the sovereign of Baḇel, My servant, and shall bring them against this
land and against its inhabitants, and against these nations all around, and
shall put them under the ban, and make them an astonishment, and a hissing, and
everlasting ruins. 
Jer
25:10  ‘And I shall banish from them the
voice of rejoicing and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and
the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones and the light of the lamp. 
Jer
25:11  ‘And all this land shall be a ruin
and a waste, and these nations shall serve the sovereign of Baḇel seventy
years. 
Jer
25:12  ‘And it shall be, when seventy
years are completed, that I shall punish the sovereign of Baḇel and that
nation, the land of the Chaldeans, for their crookedness,’ declares יהוה,
‘and shall make it everlasting ruins. 
Jer
25:13  ‘And I shall bring on that land
all My words which I have pronounced against it, all that is written in this
book, which Yirmeyahu has prophesied concerning all the nations. 
Jer
25:14  ‘For they too shall be enslaved by
many nations and great sovereigns. And I shall repay them according to their
deeds and according to the works of their hands.’ ” 
Jer
25:15  For thus said יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl to me, “Take this wine cup of wrath from My hand, and
make all the nations, to whom I send you, drink it. 
Jer
25:16  “And they shall drink, and shake,
and go mad because of the sword that I am sending among them.” 
Jer
25:17  I then took the cup from the hand
of יהוה, and made all the nations drink, to whom יהוה
had sent me, 
Jer
25:18  namely Yerushalayim and the cities of Yehuḏah, and its
sovereigns, its heads, to make them a ruin, an object of astonishment, a
hissing, and a curse, as it is this day; 
Jer
25:19  Pharaoh sovereign of Mitsrayim, and
his servants, and his heads, and all his people; 
Jer
25:20  and all the mixed multitude, and
all the sovereigns of the land of Uts, and all the sovereigns of the land of
the Philistines – even Ashqelon, and Azzah, and Eqron, and the remnant of Ashdoḏ;

Jer
25:21  Eḏom, and Mo’aḇ, and
the children of Ammon; 
Jer
25:22  and all the sovereigns of Tsor,
and all the sovereigns of Tsiḏon, and the sovereigns of the coastlands
which are beyond the sea; 
Jer
25:23  Deḏan, and Tĕma, and
Buz, and all who are in the farthest corners; 
Jer
25:24  and all the sovereigns of Araḇia
and all the sovereigns of the mixed multitude who dwell in the wilderness; 
Jer
25:25  and all the sovereigns of Zimri,
and all the sovereigns of Ĕylam, and all the sovereigns of the Medes; 
Jer
25:26  and all the sovereigns of the
north, far and near, one with another, and all the reigns of the earth which
are on the face of the ground. Also the sovereign of Shĕshaḵ shall
drink after them. 
Jer
25:27  “And you shall say to them, ‘Thus
said יהוה of hosts, the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, “Drink,
be drunk, and vomit! Fall and rise no more, because of the sword which I am
sending among you.” ’
Jer
25:28  “And it shall be, when they refuse
to take the cup from your hand to drink, then you shall say to them, ‘Thus said
יהוה of hosts, “You shall drink! 
Jer
25:29  “For look, I am beginning to bring
evil upon the city which is called by My Name, and should you be entirely
unpunished? You are not going unpunished, for I am calling for a sword on all
the inhabitants of the earth,” declares יהוה of hosts.’

Jer
25:30  “And you shall prophesy against
them all these words, and say to them, ‘ יהוה roars
from on high, and utters His voice from His set-apart dwelling place. He roars
mightily over His fold, a shout as those who tread the grapes, against all the
inhabitants of the earth. 
Jer
25:31  “Tumult shall come to the ends of
the earth, for יהוה has a controversy with the nations.
He shall enter into judgment with all flesh. The wrong He shall give to the
sword,’ declares יהוה.” 
Jer
25:32  Thus said יהוה
of hosts, “See, evil is going forth from nation to nation, and a great
whirlwind is raised up from the farthest parts of the earth. 
Jer
25:33  “And in that day the slain of יהוה
shall be from one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth. They
shall not be lamented, or gathered, or buried, for they are dung on the face of
the ground.
Jer
25:34  “Howl, you shepherds, and cry! And
roll yourselves in the ashes, you
leaders of the flock! For the days of your slaughter and your scatterings are
completed, and you shall fall like a choice vessel. 
Jer
25:35  “And a place of refuge shall
perish from the shepherds, and escape from the leaders of the flock. 
Jer
25:36  “Hear the cry of the shepherds,
and a wailing of the leaders of the flock, for יהוה is
ravaging their pasture! 
Jer
25:37  “And the pastures of peace shall
be cut down because of the burning displeasure of יהוה.

Jer
25:38  “Like a lion He shall leave His
hiding place, for their land shall become a waste because of the sword of
oppressors, and because of His burning displeasure.” 
Jer
26:1  In the beginning of the reign of
Yehoyaqim the son of Yoshiyahu, the sovereign of Yehuḏah, this word came
from יהוה, saying, 
Jer
26:2  “Thus said יהוה,
‘Stand in the courtyard of the House of יהוה, and speak
to all the cities of Yehuḏah, which come to bow themselves in the House
of יהוה, all the words that I command you to speak to
them. Do not diminish a word. 
Jer
26:3  ‘If so be that they listen and each
turn from his evil way, then I shall repent of the evil that I plan to do to
them, because of the evil of their deeds.’ 
Jer
26:4  “And you shall say to them, ‘Thus
said יהוה, “If you do not listen to Me, to walk in My
Torah which I set before you, 
Jer
26:5  to listen to the words of My
servants the prophets I am sending you, even rising up early and sending them –
though you have not listened – 
Jer
26:6  then I shall make this house like
Shiloh, and make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.” ’ ” 
Jer
26:7  And the priests and the prophets
and all the people heard Yirmeyahu speaking these words in the House of יהוה.

Jer
26:8  And it came to be, when Yirmeyahu
had ended speaking all that יהוה had commanded him to
speak to all the people, that the priests and the prophets and all the people
seized him, saying, “You shall certainly die! 
Jer
26:9  “Why have you prophesied in the
Name of יהוה, saying, ‘This house shall be like Shiloh,
and this city be dried up, without an inhabitant’?” And all the people were
gathered against Yirmeyahu in the House of יהוה. 
Jer
26:10  And the heads of Yehuḏah
heard this, and they came up from the sovereign’s house to the House of יהוה
and sat down in the entrance of the new gate of the House of יהוה.

Jer
26:11  And the priests and the prophets
spoke to the heads and all the people, saying, “A death sentence for this man!
For he has prophesied against this city, as you have heard with your ears.” 
Jer
26:12  And Yirmeyahu spoke to all the
heads and all the people, saying, “ יהוה sent me to
prophesy against this house and against this city with all the words you heard.

Jer
26:13  “And now, make good your ways and
your deeds, and obey the voice of יהוה your Elohim,
then יהוה shall relent concerning the evil He has
pronounced against you. 
Jer
26:14  “And I, look I am in your hand. Do
with me as seems good and right to you. 
Jer
26:15  “But know for certain that if you
put me to death, you are bringing innocent blood on yourselves, and on this
city, and on its inhabitants. For truly יהוה has sent
me to you to speak all these words in your hearing.” 
Jer
26:16  Then the heads and all the people
said to the priests and the prophets, “No death sentence for this man. For he
has spoken to us in the Name of יהוה our Elohim.” 
Jer
26:17  And some of the elders of the land
rose up and spoke to all the assembly of the people, saying, 
Jer
26:18  “Miḵayah of Moresheth
prophesied in the days of Ḥizqiyahu the sovereign of Yehuḏah, and
he spoke to all the people of Yehuḏah, saying, ‘Thus said יהוה
of hosts, “Tsiyon shall become a ploughed field, and Yerushalayim be heaps, and
the mountain of the House like the bare hills of the forest.” ’ 
Jer
26:19  “Did Ḥizqiyahu sovereign of
Yehuḏah and all Yehuḏah indeed put him to death? Did he not fear יהוה
and seek the favour of יהוה ? And the Master relented
concerning the evil which He had pronounced against them. But we are doing
great evil against ourselves.” 
Jer
26:20  There was however a man who
prophesied in the Name of יהוה, Uriyahu the son of Shemayahu
of Qiryath Ye‛arim, who prophesied against this city and against this
land according to all the words of Yirmeyahu. 
Jer
26:21  And when Yehoyaqim the sovereign,
with all his mighty men and all the heads, heard his words, the sovereign
sought to put him to death. But Uriyahu heard of it, and was afraid and fled,
and went to Mitsrayim. 
Jer
26:22  Then Yehoyaqim the sovereign sent
men to Mitsrayim: Elnathan the son of Aḵbor, and some men who went with
him to Mitsrayim. 
Jer
26:23  And they brought Uriyahu from
Mitsrayim and brought him to Yehoyaqim the sovereign, who smote him with the
sword and threw his dead body into the graves of the common people. 
Jer
26:24  However, the hand of Aḥiqam
son of Shaphan was with Yirmeyahu, so as not to give him into the hand of the
people to put him to death. 
Jer
27:1  In the beginning of the reign of
Yehoyaqim son of Yoshiyahu, the sovereign of Yehuḏah, this word came to
Yirmeyah from יהוה, saying, 
Jer
27:2  “This is what יהוה
said to me, ‘Make for yourselves bands and yokes. Then you shall put them on
your neck, 
Jer
27:3  and shall send them to the
sovereign of Eḏom, and the sovereign of Mo’aḇ, and the sovereign of
the Ammonites, and the sovereign of Tsor, and the sovereign of Tsiḏon, by
the hand of the messengers who come to Yerushalayim to Tsiḏqiyahu, the
sovereign of Yehuḏah. 
Jer
27:4  ‘And you shall command them to say
to their masters, “Thus said יהוה of hosts, the Elohim
of Yisra’ĕl, ‘Say this to your masters,’ 
Jer
27:5  ‘I have made the earth, the man and
the beast that are on the face of the earth, by My great power and by My
outstretched arm. And I shall give it to whom it seemed right in My eyes. 
Jer
27:6  ‘And now, I have given all these
lands into the hand of Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar the sovereign of Baḇel,
My servant. And the beasts of the field I have also given him to serve him. 
Jer
27:7  ‘And all nations shall serve him
and his son and his son’s son, until the time of his land comes. And then many
nations and great sovereigns shall make him serve them. 
Jer
27:8  ‘And it shall be, the nation and
reign that do not serve Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar the sovereign of Baḇel,
and the one that does not put its neck under the yoke of the sovereign of Baḇel,
that nation I shall punish,’ declares יהוה, ‘with the
sword, and the scarcity of food, and the pestilence, until I have consumed them
by his hand. 
Jer
27:9  ‘So do not listen to your prophets,
or to your diviners, or to your dreamers, or to your observers of clouds, or
your sorcerers, who speak to you, saying, “Do not serve the sovereign of Baḇel.”

Jer
27:10  ‘For they are prophesying
falsehood to you, to remove you far from your land. And I shall drive you out,
and you shall perish. 
Jer
27:11  ‘But the nations that bring their
necks under the yoke of the sovereign of Baḇel and serve him, I shall
leave in their own land,’ declares יהוה, ‘and they
shall till it and dwell in it.’ ” 
Jer
27:12  And I spoke to Tsiḏqiyah the
sovereign of Yehuḏah according to all these words, saying, “Bring your
necks under the yoke of the sovereign of Baḇel, and serve him and his
people, and live! 
Jer
27:13  “Why should you die, you and your
people, by the sword, by the scarcity of food, and by the pestilence, as יהוה
has spoken against the nation that does not serve the sovereign of Baḇel?

Jer
27:14  “Do not listen to the words of the
prophets who speak to you, saying, ‘Do not serve the sovereign of Baḇel,’
for they prophesy falsehood to you, 
Jer
27:15  for I have not sent them,”
declares יהוה, “yet they prophesy falsehood in My Name,
in order that I drive you out. Then you shall perish, you and the prophets who
prophesy to you.” 
Jer
27:16  Then I spoke to the priests and to
all this people, saying, “Thus said יהוה, ‘Do not
listen to the words of your prophets who are prophesying to you, saying, “See,
the vessels of the House of יהוה are brought back from
Baḇel soon now,” for they prophesy falsehood to you.
Jer
27:17  ‘Do not listen to them. Serve the
sovereign of Baḇel, and live! Why should this city become a ruin? 
Jer
27:18  ‘But if they are prophets, and if
the word of יהוה is with them, let them now make
intercession to יהוה of hosts, that the vessels which
are left in the House of יהוה, and in the house of the
sovereign of Yehuḏah, and at Yerushalayim, shall not go to Baḇel.’ 
Jer
27:19  “For thus said יהוה
of hosts concerning the columns, and concerning the Sea, and concerning the
stands, and concerning the remainder of the vessels which are left in this
city, 
Jer
27:20  which Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar
the sovereign of Baḇel did not take, when he exiled Yeḵonyah the
son of Yehoyaqim, the sovereign of Yehuḏah, from Yerushalayim to Baḇel,
and all the nobles of Yehuḏah and Yerushalayim – 
Jer
27:21  thus said יהוה
of hosts, the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, concerning the vessels that remain in
the House of יהוה, and in the house of the sovereign of
Yehuḏah and of Yerushalayim: 
Jer
27:22  ‘They shall be brought to Baḇel,
and be there until the day that I visit them,’ declares יהוה.
‘Then I shall bring them back and restore them to this place.’ ” 
Jer
28:1  And it came to be in that year, at
the beginning of the reign of Tsiḏqiyah sovereign of Yehuḏah, in
the fourth year and in the fifth month, that Ḥananyah son of Azzur the
prophet, who was from Giḇ‛on, spoke to me in the House of יהוה
in the presence of the priests and of all the people, saying, 
Jer
28:2  “Thus spoke יהוה
of hosts, the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, saying, ‘I have broken the yoke of the
sovereign of Baḇel. 
Jer
28:3  ‘Within two years I am going to
bring back to this place all the vessels of the House of יהוה,
that Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar sovereign of Baḇel removed from
this place and took to Baḇel. 
Jer
28:4  ‘And I am going to bring back to
this place Yeḵonyah son of Yehoyaqim, sovereign of Yehuḏah, with
all the exiles of Yehuḏah who went to Baḇel,’ declares יהוה,
‘for I am going to break the yoke of the sovereign of Baḇel.’ ” 
Jer
28:5  Then the prophet Yirmeyah spoke to
the prophet Ḥananyah in the presence of the priests and in the presence
of all the people who stood in the House of יהוה, 
Jer
28:6  and the prophet Yirmeyah said, “Amĕn!
יהוה do so! יהוה establish your
words which you have prophesied, to bring back the vessels of the House of יהוה
and all the exiles from Baḇel to this place! 
Jer
28:7  “Only, hear now this word that I
speak in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people: 
Jer
28:8  “The prophets who have been before
me and before you of old prophesied against many lands and great reigns, of
battle and of evil and of pestilence. 
Jer
28:9  “The prophet who prophesies of
peace – when the word of the prophet comes to pass, that prophet is known as
one whom יהוה has truly sent.” 
Jer
28:10  And Ḥananyah the prophet
took the yoke off the prophet Yirmeyah’s neck and broke it.
