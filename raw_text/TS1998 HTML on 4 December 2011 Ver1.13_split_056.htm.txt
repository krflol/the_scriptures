Romiyim/Romans
Rom
1:1  Sha’ul, a servant of יהושע
Messiah, a called emissary, separated to the Good News of Elohim, 
Rom
1:2  which He promised before through His
prophets in the Set-apart Scriptures, 
Rom
1:3  concerning His Son, who came of the
seed of Dawiḏ according to the flesh, 
Rom
1:4  who was designated Son of Elohim
with power, according to the Set-apart Spirit, by the resurrection from the
dead: יהושע Messiah, the Master of us, 
Rom
1:5  through whom we have received favour
and office of the emissary for belief-obedience among all the nations on behalf
of His Name, 
Rom
1:6  among whom you also are the called
ones of יהושע Messiah. 
Rom
1:7  To all who are in Rome, beloved of
Elohim, called, set-apart ones: Favour to you and peace from Elohim our Father
and the Master יהושע Messiah. 
Rom
1:8  First, I truly thank my Elohim
through יהושע Messiah for you all, that your
belief is spoken of in all the world. 
Rom
1:9  For Elohim is my witness, whom I
serve with my spirit in the Good News of His Son, how unceasingly I make
mention of you, 
Rom
1:10  always asking in my prayers, if at
all possible, I shall be blessed by the desire of Elohim, to come to you. 
Rom
1:11  For I long to see you, so as to
impart some spiritual gift to you, for you to be established, 
Rom
1:12  and that is, to be encouraged
together among you, each by the other’s belief – both yours and mine. 
Rom
1:13  And I do not wish you to be
unaware, brothers, that I often purposed to come to you, but was hindered until
now, in order to have some fruit among you, as also among the other gentiles. 
Rom
1:14  I am a debtor both to Greeks and to
foreigners, both to wise and to foolish. 
Rom
1:15  That is why I am so eager to bring
the Good News also to you who are in Rome. 
Rom
1:16  For I am not ashamed of the Good
News of Messiah, for it is the power of Elohim for deliverance to everyone who
believes, to the Yehuḏite first and also to the Greek. 
Rom
1:17  For in it the righteousness of
Elohim is revealed from belief to belief, as it has been written, “But the
righteous shall live by belief.”
Rom
1:18  For the wrath of Elohim is revealed
from heaven against all wickedness and unrighteousness of men, who suppress the
truth in unrighteousness, 
Rom
1:19  because that which is known of
Elohim is manifest among them, for Elohim has manifested it to them. 
Rom
1:20  For since the creation of the world
His invisible qualities have been
clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, both His everlasting
power and Mightiness, for them to be without excuse, 
Rom
1:21  because, although they knew Elohim,
they did not esteem Him as Elohim, nor gave thanks, but became vain in their
reasonings, and their undiscerning heart was darkened. 
Rom
1:22  Claiming to be wise, they became
fools, 
Rom
1:23  and changed the esteem of the
incorruptible Elohim into the likeness of an image of corruptible man, and of
birds and of four-footed beasts and of reptiles. 
Rom
1:24  Therefore Elohim gave them up to
uncleanness in the lust of their hearts, to disrespect their bodies among
themselves, 
Rom
1:25  who changed the truth of Elohim
into the falsehood, and worshipped and served what was created rather than the
Creator, who is blessed forever. Amĕn. 
Rom
1:26  Because of this Elohim gave them
over to degrading passions. For even their women exchanged natural relations
for what is against nature, 
Rom
1:27  and likewise, the men also, having
left natural relations with woman, burned in their lust for one another, men
with men committing indecency, and receiving back the reward which was due for
their straying. 
Rom
1:28  And even as they did not think it
worth- while to possess the knowledge of Elohim, Elohim gave them over to a
worthless mind, to do what is improper, 
Rom
1:29  having been filled with all
unrighteousness, whoring, wickedness, greed, evil; filled with envy, murder,
fighting, deceit, evil habits; whisperers, 
Rom
1:30  slanderers, haters of Elohim,
insolent, proud, boasters, devisers of evils, disobedient to parents, 
Rom
1:31  without discernment, covenant
breakers, unloving, unforgiving, ruthless; 
Rom
1:32  who, though they know the
righteousness of Elohim, that those who practise such deserve death, not only
do the same but also approve of those who practise them. 
Rom
2:1  Therefore, O man, you are without
excuse, everyone who judges, for in which you judge another you condemn
yourself, since you who judge practise the same wrongs. 
Rom
2:2  And we know that the judgment of
Elohim is according to truth against those who practise such wrongs. 
Rom
2:3  And do you think, O man, you who
judge those practising such wrongs,
and doing the same, that you shall escape the judgment of Elohim? 
Rom
2:4  Or do you despise the riches of His
kindness, and tolerance, and patience, not knowing that the kindness of Elohim
leads you to repentance?
Rom
2:5  But according to your hardness and
your unrepentant heart you are treasuring up for yourself wrath in the day of
wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of Elohim, 
Rom
2:6  who “shall render to each one
according to his works”:
Rom
2:7  everlasting life to those who by
persistence in good work seek for esteem, and respect, and incorruptibility; 
Rom
2:8  but wrath and displeasure to those who
are self-seeking and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness; 
Rom
2:9  affliction and distress on every
human being working what is evil, of the Yehuḏite first, and also of the
Greek; 
Rom
2:10  but esteem, respect, and peace to
everyone working what is good, to the Yehuḏite first and also to the
Greek. 
Rom
2:11  For there is no partiality with
Elohim. 
Rom
2:12  For as many as sinned without Torah
shall also perish without Torah, and as many as sinned in the Torah shall be
judged by the Torah. 
Rom
2:13  For not the hearers of the Torah
are righteous in the sight of Elohim, but the doers of the law shall be
declared right.
Rom
2:14  For when gentiles, who do not have
the Torah, by nature do what is in the Torah, although not having the Torah, they
are a Torah to themselves, 
Rom
2:15  who show the work of the Torah
written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and between
themselves their thoughts accusing or even excusing, 
Rom
2:16  in the day when Elohim shall judge
the secrets of men through יהושע Messiah,
according to my Good News. 
Rom
2:17  See, you are called a Yehuḏite,
and rest on the Torah, and make your boast in Elohim, 
Rom
2:18  and know the desire of Elohim, and approve what is superior,
being instructed out of the Torah, 
Rom
2:19  and are trusting that you yourself
are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness, 
Rom
2:20  an instructor of foolish ones, a
teacher of babes, having the form of knowledge and of the truth in the Torah.
Rom
2:21  You, then, who teach another, do
you not teach yourself? You who proclaim that a man should not steal, do you
steal? 
Rom
2:22  You who say, “Do not commit
adultery,” do you commit adultery? You who abominate idols, do you rob temples?

Rom
2:23  You who make your boast in the
Torah, through the transgression of the Torah do you disrespect Elohim? 
Rom
2:24  For “The Name of Elohim is
blasphemed among the gentiles because of you,” as it has been written. 
Rom
2:25  For circumcision indeed profits if
you practise the Torah, but if you are a transgressor of the Torah, your
circumcision has become uncircumcision. 
Rom
2:26  So, if an uncircumcised one watches
over the righteousnesses of the Torah, shall not his uncircumcision be reckoned
as circumcision? 
Rom
2:27  And the uncircumcised by nature,
who perfects the Torah, shall judge you who notwithstanding letter and
circumcision are a transgressor of the Torah! 
Rom
2:28  For he is not a Yehuḏite who
is so outwardly, neither is
circumcision that which is outward in the flesh. 
Rom
2:29  But a Yehuḏite is he who is so inwardly, and circumcision is that of
the heart, in Spirit, not literally, whose praise is not from men but from
Elohim.
Rom
3:1  What then is the advantage of the
Yehuḏite, or what is the value of the circumcision? 
Rom
3:2  Much in every way! Because firstly
indeed, that they were entrusted with the Words of Elohim.
Rom
3:3  For what if some did not believe?
Shall their unbelief nullify the trustworthiness of Elohim? 
Rom
3:4  Let it not be! But let Elohim be
true, and every man a liar, as it has been written, “That You should be
declared right in Your words, and prevail in Your judging.” 
Rom
3:5  But if our unrighteousness
establishes the righteousness of Elohim, what shall we say? Is Elohim
unrighteous who is inflicting wrath? I speak as a man. 
Rom
3:6  Let it not be! Otherwise how shall
Elohim judge the world? 
Rom
3:7  For if the truth of Elohim has
increased through my lie, to His esteem, why am I also still judged as a
sinner? 
Rom
3:8  And why not say, “Let us do
evil so that the good might come”? – as we are wrongly accused and as some
claim that we say. Their judgment is in the right. 
Rom
3:9  What then? Are we better than they? Not at all, for we have
previously accused both Yehuḏim and Greeks that they are all under sin. 
Rom
3:10  As it has been written, “There is
none righteous, no, not one! 
Rom
3:11  “There is no one who is
understanding, there is none who is seeking Elohim. 
Rom
3:12  “They all have turned aside, they
have together become worthless. There is none who does good, no, not one.” 
Rom
3:13  “Their throat is an open tomb, with
their tongues they have deceived,” “The poison of adders is under their lips,” 
Rom
3:14  “Whose mouth is filled with cursing
and bitterness.” 
Rom
3:15  “Their feet are swift to shed
blood, 
Rom
3:16  ruin and wretchedness are in their
ways, 
Rom
3:17  and the way of peace they have not
known.” 
Rom
3:18  “There is no fear of Elohim before
their eyes.” 
Rom
3:19  And we know that whatever the Torah
says, it says to those who are in the Torah, so that every mouth might be
stopped, and all the world come under judgment before Elohim. 
Rom
3:20  Therefore by works of Torah no
flesh shall be declared right before Him, for by the Torah is the knowledge of
sin.
Rom
3:21  But now, apart from the Torah, a
righteousness of Elohim has been revealed, being witnessed by the Torah and the
Prophets, 
Rom
3:22  and the righteousness of Elohim is
through belief in יהושע Messiah to all and on all
who believe. For there is no difference, 
Rom
3:23  for all have sinned and fall short
of the esteem of Elohim, 
Rom
3:24  being declared right, without
paying, by His favour through the redemption which is in Messiah יהושע,

Rom
3:25  whom Elohim set forth as an
atonement, through belief in His blood, to demonstrate His righteousness,
because in His tolerance Elohim had passed over the sins that had taken place
before, 
Rom
3:26  to demonstrate at the present time
His righteousness, that He is righteous and declares righteous the one who has
belief in יהושע. 
Rom
3:27  Where, then, is the boasting? It is
shut out. By what Torah? Of works? No, but by the Torah of belief. 
Rom
3:28  For we reckon that a man is
declared right by belief without works of Torah. 
Rom
3:29  Or is He the Elohim of the Yehuḏim only, and not also of the
gentiles? Yea, of the gentiles also, 
Rom
3:30  since it is one Elohim who shall
declare right the circumcised by belief and the uncircumcised through belief. 
Rom
3:31  Do we then nullify the Torah
through the belief? Let it not be! On the contrary, we establish the Torah.
Rom
4:1  What, then, shall we say Aḇraham
our father, to have found, according to the flesh? 
Rom
4:2  For if Aḇraham was declared
right by works, he has ground for
boasting, but not before Elohim. 
Rom
4:3  For what does the Scripture say? “Aḇraham
believed Elohim, and it was reckoned to him for righteousness.”
Rom
4:4  And to him who is working, the
reward is not reckoned as a favour but as a debt. 
Rom
4:5  And to him who is not working but
believes on Him who is declaring right the wicked, his belief is reckoned for
righteousness, 
Rom
4:6  even as Dawiḏ also says of the
blessedness of the man to whom Elohim reckons righteousness without works: 
Rom
4:7  “Blessed are those whose
lawlessnesses are forgiven, and whose sins are covered, 
Rom
4:8  blessed is the man to whom יהוה
shall by no means reckon sin.” 
Rom
4:9  Is this blessing then upon the
circumcised only, or also upon the
uncircumcised? For we affirm: Belief was reckoned unto Aḇraham for
righteousness. 
Rom
4:10  How then was it reckoned? Being in
circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.

Rom
4:11  And he received the sign of
circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the belief while in uncircumcision, for him to be a father of all those
believing through uncircumcision, for righteousness to be reckoned to them
also, 
Rom
4:12  and the father of circumcision to
those who not only are of the circumcision, but who also walk in the steps of
the belief which our father Aḇraham had in uncircumcision. 
Rom
4:13  For the promise that he should be
the heir of the world, was not to Aḇraham or to his seed through the
Torah, but through a righteousness of belief. 
Rom
4:14  For if those who are of the Torah
are heirs, belief has been made useless, and the promise has been nullified, 
Rom
4:15  for the Torah works out wrath, for
where there is no Torah there is no transgression. 
Rom
4:16  On account of this it is of belief,
that it be according to favour, for the promise to be made certain to all the
seed, not only to those who are of the Torah, but also to those who are of the
belief of Aḇraham, who is father of us all – 
Rom
4:17  as it has been written, “I have
made you a father of many nations” – in the presence of Him whom he believed,
even Elohim, who gives life to the dead and calls that which does not exist as
existing, 
Rom
4:18  who against all expectation did believe, in expectation, so that he should
become father of many nations, according to what was said, “So shall your seed
be.” 
Rom
4:19  And not having grown weak in
belief, he did not consider his own body, already dead, being about a hundred
years old, and the deadness of Sarah’s womb, 
Rom
4:20  he did not hesitate about the
promise of Elohim through unbelief, but was strengthened in belief, giving
esteem to Elohim, 
Rom
4:21  and being completely persuaded that
what He had promised He was also able to do. 
Rom
4:22  Therefore also “it was reckoned to
him for righteousness.” 
Rom
4:23  And not because of him alone was it
written that it was reckoned to him, 
Rom
4:24  but also because of us, to whom it
shall be reckoned, to us who believe in Him who raised up יהושע
our Master from the dead, 
Rom
4:25  who was delivered up because of our
trespasses, and was raised for us to be declared right. 
Rom
5:1  Therefore, having been declared
right by belief, we have peace with Elohim through our Master יהושע
Messiah, 
Rom
5:2  through whom also we have access by
belief into this favour in which we stand, and we exult in the expectation of
the esteem of Elohim. 
Rom
5:3  And not only this, but we also exult
in pressures, knowing that pressure works endurance; 
Rom
5:4  and endurance, approvedness; and
approvedness, expectation. 
Rom
5:5  And expectation does not disappoint,
because the love of Elohim has been poured out in our hearts by the Set-apart
Spirit which was given to us. 
Rom
5:6  For when we were still weak, Messiah
in due time died for the wicked. 
Rom
5:7  For one shall hardly die for a
righteous one, though possibly for a good one someone would even have the
courage to die. 
Rom
5:8  But Elohim proves His own love for
us, in that while we were still sinners, Messiah died for us. 
Rom
5:9  Much more then, having now been
declared right by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him. 
Rom
5:10  For if, being enemies, we were
restored to favour with Elohim through the death of His Son, much more, having
been restored to favour, we shall be saved by His life. 
Rom
5:11  And not only this, but we also
exult in Elohim through our Master יהושע Messiah,
through whom we have now received the restoration to favour. 
Rom
5:12  For this reason, even as through
one man sin did enter into the world, and death through sin, and thus death
spread to all men, because all sinned – 
Rom
5:13  for until the Torah, sin was in the
world, but sin is not reckoned when there is no Torah. 
Rom
5:14  But death reigned from Aḏam
until Mosheh, even over those who had not sinned according to the likeness of
the transgression of Aḏam, who is a type of Him who was to come. 
Rom
5:15  But the favourable gift is not like
the trespass. For if by the one man’s trespass many died, much more the favour
of Elohim, and the gift in favour of the one Man, יהושע
Messiah, overflowed to many. 
Rom
5:16  And the favourable gift is not as
by one having sinned. For indeed the judgment was of one to condemnation, but
the favourable gift is of many trespasses unto righteousness. 
Rom
5:17  For if by the trespass of the one,
death did reign through the one, much more those who receive the overflowing
favour and the gift of righteousness shall reign in life through the One, יהושע
Messiah. 
Rom
5:18  So then, as through one trespass
there resulted condemnation to all men, so also through one righteous act there
resulted righteous-declaring of life to all men. 
Rom
5:19  For as through the disobedience of
one man many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the One many
shall be made righteous. 
Rom
5:20  And the Torah came in beside, so
that the trespass would increase. But where sin increased, favour increased
still more, 
Rom
5:21  so that as sin did reign in death,
even so favour might reign through righteousness to everlasting life through יהושע
Messiah our Master. 
Rom
6:1  What, then, shall we say? Shall we
continue in sin, to let favour increase? 
Rom
6:2  Let it not be! How shall we who died
to sin still live in it?
Rom
6:3  Or do you not know that as many of
us as were immersed into Messiah יהושע were
immersed into His death? 
Rom
6:4  We were therefore buried with Him
through immersion into death, that as Messiah was raised from the dead by the
esteem of the Father, so also we should walk in newness of life. 
Rom
6:5  For if we have come to be grown
together in the likeness of His death, we shall be also of the resurrection, 
Rom
6:6  knowing this, that our old man was
impaled with Him, so that the body of sin might be rendered powerless, to serve
sin no longer. 
Rom
6:7  For he who has died has been made
right from sin. 
Rom
6:8  And if we died with Messiah, we
believe that we shall also live with Him, 
Rom
6:9  knowing that Messiah, having been
raised from the dead, dies no more – death no longer rules over Him. 
Rom
6:10  For in that He died, He died to sin
once for all; but in that He lives, He lives to Elohim. 
Rom
6:11  So you also, reckon yourselves to
be dead indeed to sin, but alive to Elohim in Messiah יהושע
our Master. 
Rom
6:12  Therefore do not let sin reign in
your mortal body, to obey it in its desires, 
Rom
6:13  neither present your members as
instruments of unrighteousness to sin, but present yourselves to Elohim as
being alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to
Elohim. 
Rom
6:14  For sin shall not rule over you,
for you are not under the law but under favour. 
Rom
6:15  What then? Shall we sin because we
are not under Torah but under favour? Let it not be! 
Rom
6:16  Do you not know that to whom you
present yourselves servants for obedience, you are servants of the one whom you
obey, whether of sin to death, or of obedience to righteousness? 
Rom
6:17  But thanks to Elohim that you were
servants of sin, yet you obeyed from the heart that form of teaching to which
you were entrusted. 
Rom
6:18  And having been set free from sin,
you became servants of righteousness. 
Rom
6:19  I speak as a man, because of the
weakness of your flesh. For even as you did present your members as servants of
uncleanness, and of lawlessness resulting in lawlessness, so now present your
members as servants of righteousness resulting in set-apartness. 
Rom
6:20  For when you were servants of sin,
you were free from righteousness. 
Rom
6:21  What fruit, therefore, were you
having then, over which you are now ashamed? For the end thereof is death. 
Rom
6:22  But now, having been set free from
sin, and having become servants of Elohim, you have your fruit resulting in
set-apartness, and the end, everlasting life. 
Rom
6:23  For the wages of sin is death, but
the favourable gift of Elohim is everlasting life in Messiah יהושע
our Master. 
Rom
7:1  Or do you not know, brothers – for I
speak to those knowing the Torah – that the Torah rules over a man as long as
he lives? 
Rom
7:2  For the married woman has been bound
by Torah to the living husband, but if the husband dies, she is released from
the Torah concerning her husband. 
Rom
7:3  So then, while her husband lives,
she shall be called an adulteress if she becomes another man’s. But if her
husband dies, she is free from that part
of the Torah, so that she is not an adulteress, having become another man’s.

Rom
7:4  So my brothers, you also were put to
death to the Torah through the body of Messiah, for you to become another’s,
the One who was raised from the dead, that we should bear fruit to Elohim. 
Rom
7:5  For when we were in the flesh, the
passions of sins, through the Torah, were working in our members to bear fruit
to death. 
Rom
7:6  But now we have been released from
the Torah, having died to what we were held by, so that we should serve in
newness of Spirit and not in oldness of letter. 
Rom
7:7  What, then, shall we say? Is the
Torah sin? Let it not be! However, I did not know sin except through the Torah.
For also the covetousness I knew not if the Torah had not said, “You shall not
covet.” 
Rom
7:8  But sin, having taken the occasion
through the command, did work in me all sorts
of covetousness. For apart from Torah sin is dead. 
Rom
7:9  And I was alive apart from the Torah
once, but when the command came, the sin revived, and I died. 
Rom
7:10  And the command which was to result
in life, this I found to result in death. 
Rom
7:11  For sin, having taken the occasion
through the command, deceived me, and through it killed me. 
Rom
7:12  So that the Torah truly is
set-apart, and the command set-apart, and righteous, and good. 
Rom
7:13  Therefore, has that which is good
become death to me? Let it not be! But the sin, that sin might be manifest, was
working death in me through what is good, so that sin through the command might
become an exceedingly great Sinner. 
Rom
7:14  For we know that the Torah is
Spiritual, but I am fleshly, sold under sin. 
Rom
7:15  For what I work, I know not. For
what I wish, that I do not practise, but what I hate, that I do. 
Rom
7:16  But if I do what I do not wish, I
agree with the Torah that it is good. 
Rom
7:17  And now, it is no longer I that
work it, but the sin dwelling in me. 
Rom
7:18  For I know that in me, that is in
my flesh, dwells no good. For to wish is present with me, but to work the good
I do not find. 
Rom
7:19  For the good that I wish to do, I
do not do; but the evil I do not wish to do, this I practise. 
Rom
7:20  And if I do that which I do not
wish, it is no longer I who work it, but the sin dwelling in me. 
Rom
7:21  I find therefore this law, that
when I wish to do the good, that the evil is present with me. 
Rom
7:22  For I delight in the Torah of
Elohim according to the inward man,
Rom
7:23  but I see another law in my
members, battling against the Torah of my mind, and bringing me into captivity
to the law of sin which is in my members. 
Rom
7:24  Wretched man that I am! Who shall
deliver me from this body of death? 
Rom
7:25  Thanks to Elohim, through יהושע
Messiah our Master! So then, with the mind I myself truly serve the Torah of
Elohim, but with the flesh the law of sin. 
Rom
8:1  There is, then, now no condemnation
to those who are in Messiah יהושע, who do not
walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit. 
Rom
8:2  For the Torah of the Spirit of the
life in Messiah יהושע has set me free from the
law of sin and of death. 
Rom
8:3  For the Torah being powerless, in
that it was weak through the flesh, Elohim, having His own Son in the likeness
of flesh of sin, and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh, 
Rom
8:4  so that the righteousness of the
Torah should be completed in us who do not walk according to the flesh but
according to the Spirit. 
Rom
8:5  For those who live according to the
flesh set their minds on the matters
of the flesh, but those who live
according to the Spirit, the matters
of the Spirit. 
Rom
8:6  For the mind of the flesh is death,
but the mind of the Spirit is life and peace. 
Rom
8:7  Because the mind of the flesh is
enmity towards Elohim, for it does not subject itself to the Torah of Elohim,
neither indeed is it able,
Rom
8:8  and those who are in the flesh are
unable to please Elohim. 
Rom
8:9  But you are not in the flesh but in
the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of Elohim dwells in you. And if anyone does
not have the Spirit of Messiah, this one is not His. 
Rom
8:10  And if Messiah is in you, the body
is truly dead on account of sin, but the Spirit is life on account of
righteousness. 
Rom
8:11  And if the Spirit of Him who raised
יהושע from the dead dwells in you, He who raised
Messiah from the dead shall also give life to your mortal bodies through His
Spirit dwelling in you. 
Rom
8:12  So then, brothers, we are not
debtors to the flesh, to live according to the flesh. 
Rom
8:13  For if you live according to the
flesh, you are going to die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of
the body, you shall live. 
Rom
8:14  For as many as are led by the
Spirit of Elohim, these are sons of Elohim. 
Rom
8:15  For you did not receive the spirit
of bondage again to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption by whom we
cry out, “Abba, Father.” 
Rom
8:16  The Spirit Himself bears witness
with our spirit that we are children of Elohim, 
Rom
8:17  and if children, also heirs – truly
heirs of Elohim, and co-heirs with Messiah, if indeed we suffer with Him, in
order that we also be exalted together. 
Rom
8:18  For I reckon that the sufferings of
this present time are not worth comparing with the esteem that is to be
revealed in us. 
Rom
8:19  For the intense longing of the
creation eagerly waits for the revealing of the sons of Elohim.
Rom
8:20  For the creation was subjected to
futility, not from choice, but because of Him who subjected it, in
anticipation, 
Rom
8:21  that the creation itself also shall
be delivered from the bondage to corruption into the esteemed freedom of the
children of Elohim. 
Rom
8:22  For we know that all the creation
groans together, and suffers the pains of childbirth together until now. 
Rom
8:23  And not only so, but even we
ourselves who have the first-fruits of the Spirit, we ourselves also groan
within ourselves, eagerly waiting for the adoption, the redemption of our body.

Rom
8:24  For in this expectation we were
saved, but expectation that is seen is not expectation, for when anyone sees,
does he expect it? 
Rom
8:25  And if we expect what we do not
see, we eagerly wait for it with endurance. 
Rom
8:26  And in the same way the Spirit does
help in our weaknesses. For we do not know what we should pray, but the Spirit
Himself pleads our case for us with groanings unutterable. 
Rom
8:27  And He who searches the hearts
knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He makes intercession for the
set-apart ones according to Elohim. 
Rom
8:28  And we know that all matters work together for good to those
who love Elohim, to those who are called according to His purpose. 
Rom
8:29  Because those whom He knew
beforehand, He also ordained beforehand to be conformed to the likeness of His
Son, for Him to be the first-born
among many brothers. 
Rom
8:30  And whom He ordained beforehand,
these He also called, and whom He called, these He also declared right. And
whom He declared right, these He also esteemed. 
Rom
8:31  What then shall we say to this? If
Elohim is for us, who is against us? 
Rom
8:32  Truly, He who did not spare His own
Son, but delivered Him up on behalf of us all – how shall He not, along with
Him, freely give us all else? 
Rom
8:33  Who shall bring any charge against
Elohim’s chosen ones? It is Elohim who is declaring right. 
Rom
8:34  Who is he who is condemning? It is
Messiah who died, and furthermore is also raised up, who is also at the right
hand of Elohim, who also makes intercession for us. 
Rom
8:35  Who shall separate us from the love
of the Messiah? Shall pressure, or distress, or persecution, or scarcity of
food, or nakedness, or danger, or sword? 
Rom
8:36  As it has been written, “For Your
sake we are killed all day long, we are reckoned as sheep of slaughter.” 
Rom
8:37  But in all this we are more than
overcomers through Him who loved us. 
Rom
8:38  For I am persuaded that neither
death nor life, nor messengers nor principalities nor powers, neither the
present nor the future, 
Rom
8:39  nor height nor depth, nor any other
creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of Elohim which is in
Messiah יהושע our Master. 
Rom
9:1  I speak the truth in Messiah, I do
not lie, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Set-apart Spirit, 
Rom
9:2  that I have great sadness and
continual grief in my heart. 
Rom
9:3  For I myself could have wished to be
banished from Messiah for the sake of my brothers, my relatives according to
the flesh, 
Rom
9:4  who are Yisra’ĕlites, whose is
the adoption, and the esteem, and the covenants, and the giving of the Torah,
and the worship, and the promises, 
Rom
9:5  whose are the fathers, and from whom
is the Messiah according to the flesh, who is over all, Elohim-blessed forever.
Amĕn. 
Rom
9:6  However, it is not as though the
word of Elohim has failed. For they are not all Yisra’ĕl who are of Yisra’ĕl,

Rom
9:7  neither are they all children
because they are the seed of Aḇraham, but, “In Yitsḥaq your seed
shall be called.” 
Rom
9:8  That is, those who are the children
of the flesh, these are not the children of Elohim, but the children of the
promise are reckoned as the seed. 
Rom
9:9  For this is the word of promise, “At
this time I shall come and Sarah shall have a son.” 
Rom
9:10  And not only so, but Riḇqah
having conceived by one, our father Yitsḥaq. 
Rom
9:11  Yet, before they were born or had
done any good or evil – in order that the purpose of Elohim, according to
choice, might stand, not of works but of Him who calls – 
Rom
9:12  it was said to her, “The greater
shall serve the lesser,” 
Rom
9:13  as it has been written, “Ya‛aqoḇ
I have loved, but Ĕsaw I have hated.” 
Rom
9:14  What, then, shall we say? Is there
unrighteousness with Elohim? Let it not be! 
Rom
9:15  For He says to Mosheh, “I shall
favour whomever I favour, and I shall have compassion on whomever I have
compassion.” 
Rom
9:16  So, then, it is not of him who is
wishing, nor of him who is running, but of Elohim who shows favour. 
Rom
9:17  For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, “For
this same purpose I have raised you up, to show My power in you, and that My
Name be declared in all the earth.” 
Rom
9:18  So, then, He favours whom He
wishes, and He hardens whom He wishes. 
Rom
9:19  Then you shall say to me, “Why does
He still find fault? For who has resisted His counsel?” 
Rom
9:20  But who are you, O man, to talk
back to Elohim? Shall that which is formed say to him who formed it, “Why have
you made me like this?” 
Rom
9:21  Does not the potter have authority
over the clay, from the same lump to make one vessel for value and another not
for value? 
Rom
9:22  And if Elohim, desiring to show
wrath, and to make His power known, with much patience tolerated the vessels of
wrath prepared for destruction, 
Rom
9:23  and that He might make known the
riches of His esteem on vessels of compassion, which He had prepared beforehand
for esteem, 
Rom
9:24  even whom He called, not only us of
the Yehuḏim, but also of the gentiles? 
Rom
9:25  As He says in Hoshĕa too, “I
shall call them My people, who were not My people, and her beloved, who was not
beloved.” 
Rom
9:26  “And it shall be in the place where
it was said to them, ‘You are not My people,’ there they shall be called sons
of the living Elohim.” 
Rom
9:27  And Yeshayahu cries out on behalf
of Yisra’ĕl, “Though the number of the children of Yisra’ĕl be as the
sand of the sea, the remnant shall be saved. 
Rom
9:28  For He is bringing a matter to an
end, and is cutting it short in righteousness, because יהוה
shall cut short a matter on the earth.” 
Rom
9:29  And as Yeshayahu said before, “If יהוה
of hosts had not left us a seed, we would have become like Seḏom, and we
would have been made like Amorah.” 
Rom
9:30  What shall we say then? That
gentiles not following after righteousness, have obtained righteousness, even
the righteousness of belief, 
Rom
9:31  but Yisra’ĕl following after
the Torah of righteousness, has not arrived at the Torah of righteousness. 
Rom
9:32  Why? Because it was not of belief, but as by works of Torah. For they stumbled
at the Stone of stumbling. 
Rom
9:33  As it has been written, “See, I lay
in Tsiyon a Stone of stumbling and a Rock that makes for falling, and everyone
who is believing on Him shall not be put to shame.” 
Rom
10:1  Truly brothers, my heart’s desire
and prayer to Elohim for Yisra’ĕl is for deliverance. 
Rom
10:2  For I bear them witness that they
have an ardour for Elohim, but not according to knowledge. 
Rom
10:3  For not knowing the righteousness
of Elohim, and seeking to establish their own righteousness, they did not
subject themselves to the righteousness of Elohim.
Rom
10:4  For Messiah is the goal of the ‘Torah
unto righteousness’to everyone who believes.
Rom
10:5  For Mosheh writes about the
righteousness which is of the Torah, “The man who does these shall live by
them.” 
Rom
10:6  But the righteousness of belief
speaks in this way, “Do not say in your heart, ‘Who shall ascend into the
heavens?’ ” – that is, to bring Messiah down; or, 
Rom
10:7  “ ‘Who shall descend into the
abyss?’ ” – that is, to bring Messiah up from the dead. 
Rom
10:8  But what does it say? “The word is
near you, in your mouth and in your heart” – that is, the word of belief which
we are proclaiming: 
Rom
10:9  That if you confess with your mouth
the Master יהושע and believe in your heart that
Elohim has raised Him from the dead, you shall be saved. 
Rom
10:10  For with the heart one believes
unto righteousness, and one confesses with the mouth, and so is saved. 
Rom
10:11  Because the Scripture says, “Whoever
puts his trust in Him shall not be put to shame.” 
Rom
10:12  Because there is no distinction
between Yehuḏite and Greek, for the same Master of all is rich to all
those calling upon Him. 
Rom
10:13  For “everyone who calls on the
Name of יהוה shall be saved.” 
Rom
10:14  How then shall they call on Him in
whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in Him of whom they
have not heard? And how shall they hear without one proclaiming? 
Rom
10:15  And how shall they proclaim if
they are not sent? As it has been written, “How pleasant are the feet of those
who bring the Good News of peace, who bring the Good News of the good!” 
Rom
10:16  However, not all obeyed the Good
News. For Yeshayahu says, “ יהוה, who has believed our
report?” 
Rom
10:17  So then belief comes by hearing,
and hearing by the word of Elohim. 
Rom
10:18  But I ask, Did they not hear? Yea
indeed, “Their voice went out to all the earth, and their words to the ends of
the world.” 
Rom
10:19  But I ask, Did Yisra’ĕl not
know? First Mosheh says, “I shall provoke you to jealousy by those who are not
a nation, I shall enrage you by an unwise nation.” 
Rom
10:20  And Yeshayahu boldly says, “I was
found by those not seeking Me, I was made manifest to those not asking for Me.”

Rom
10:21  And to Yisra’ĕl He says, “All
day long I have stretched out My hands to a disobedient and back-talking
people.” 
Rom
11:1  I say then, has Elohim rejected His
people? Let it not be! For I also am a Yisra’ĕlite, of the seed of Aḇraham,
of the tribe of Binyamin. 
Rom
11:2  Elohim has not rejected His people
whom He knew beforehand. Or do you not know what the Scripture says of Ĕliyahu,
how he pleads with Elohim against Yisra’ĕl, saying,
Rom
11:3  “ יהוה,
they have killed Your prophets and overthrown Your altars, and I alone am left,
and they seek my life”? 
Rom
11:4  But what does the answer of Elohim say to him? “I have left for
Myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Ba‛al.” 
Rom
11:5  So therefore also, at this present
time a remnant according to the choice of favour has come to be. 
Rom
11:6  And if by favour, it is no longer
of works, otherwise favour is no longer favour. And if it is of works, it is no
longer favour, otherwise work is no longer work. 
Rom
11:7  What then? Yisra’ĕl has not
obtained what it seeks, but the chosen did obtain it, and the rest were
hardened. 
Rom
11:8  As it has been written, “ יהוה
has given them a spirit of deep sleep, eyes not to see and ears not to hear,
unto this day.” 
Rom
11:9  Dawiḏ also says, “Let their
table become for a snare, and for a trap, and for a stumbling-block and a
recompense to them, 
Rom
11:10  let their eyes be darkened, not to
see, and bow down their back always.” 
Rom
11:11  I say then, have they stumbled
that they should fall? Let it not be! But by their fall deliverance has come to
the gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy. 
Rom
11:12  And if their fall is riches for
the world, and their failure riches for the gentiles, how much more their
completeness! 
Rom
11:13  For I speak to you, the gentiles,
inasmuch as I am an emissary to the gentiles, I esteem my service, 
Rom
11:14  if somehow I might provoke to
jealousy those who are my flesh and
save some of them. 
Rom
11:15  For if their casting away is the
restoration to favour of the world, what is their acceptance but life from the
dead? 
Rom
11:16  Now if the first-fruit is
set-apart, the lump is also. And if the root is set-apart, so are the branches.

Rom
11:17  And if some of the branches were
broken off, and you, being a wild olive tree, have been grafted in among them,
and came to share the root and fatness of the olive tree, 
Rom
11:18  do not boast against the branches.
And if you boast, remember: you do
not bear the root, but the root bears
you! 
Rom
11:19  You shall say then, “The branches
were broken off that I might be grafted in.” 
Rom
11:20  Good! By unbelief they were broken
off, and you stand by belief. Do not be arrogant, but fear. 
Rom
11:21  For if Elohim did not spare the
natural branches, He might not spare you either. 
Rom
11:22  See then the kindness and
sharpness of Elohim: on those who fell sharpness, but toward you kindness, if
you continue in His kindness,
otherwise you also shall be cut off. 
Rom
11:23  And they also, if they do not
continue in unbelief, shall be grafted in, for Elohim is able to graft them in
again. 
Rom
11:24  For if you were cut out of the
olive tree which is wild by nature, and were grafted contrary to nature into a
good olive tree, how much more shall these who are the natural branches, be grafted into their own
olive tree? 
Rom
11:25  For I do not wish you to be
ignorant of this secret, brothers, lest you should be wise in your own
estimation, that hardening in part has come over Yisra’ĕl, until the
completeness of the gentiles has come in.
Rom
11:26  And so all Yisra’ĕl shall be
saved, as it has been written, “The Deliverer shall come out of Tsiyon, and He
shall turn away wickedness from Ya‛aqoḇ, 
Rom
11:27  and this is My covenant with them,
when I take away their sins.”
Rom
11:28  Truly, as regards the Good News they are enemies for your sake, but
concerning the choice they are
beloved for the sake of the fathers. 
Rom
11:29  For the gifts and the calling of
Elohim are not to be repented of. 
Rom
11:30  For as you also at one time
disobeyed Elohim, but now have obtained compassion through their disobedience, 
Rom
11:31  so also these have now disobeyed,
that through the compassion shown you they also might obtain compassion. 
Rom
11:32  For Elohim has shut them all up to
disobedience, in order to have compassion on all. 
Rom
11:33  Oh, the depth of riches, and
wisdom and knowledge of Elohim! How unsearchable His judgments and untraceable
His ways! 
Rom
11:34  “For who has known the mind of יהוה
? Or who has become His counsellor?” 
Rom
11:35  “Or who first gave to Him, and it
shall be given back to him?” 
Rom
11:36  Because of Him, and through Him,
and to Him, are all, to whom be esteem forever. Amĕn. 
Rom
12:1  I call upon you, therefore,
brothers, through the compassion of Elohim, to present your bodies a living
offering – set-apart, well-pleasing to Elohim – your reasonable worship. 
Rom
12:2  And do not be conformed to this
world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you prove what
is that good and well-pleasing and perfect desire of Elohim. 
Rom
12:3  For I say, through the favour which
has been given to me, to everyone who is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he should
think, but to think soberly, as Elohim has given to each a measure of belief. 
Rom
12:4  For as we have many members in one
body, but all members do not have the same function, 
Rom
12:5  so we, the many, are one body in
Messiah, and members each one of one another. 
Rom
12:6  Now having different gifts,
according to the favour which was given to us, let us use them accordingly: if prophecy, according to the
proportion of belief; 
Rom
12:7  if serving, in the serving; or he
who is teaching, in the teaching; 
Rom
12:8  or he who encourages, in the
encouragement; or he who is sharing, in sincerity; he who is leading, in
diligence; he who shows compassion, joyously. 
Rom
12:9  Let love be without hypocrisy.
Shrink from what is wicked, cling to what is good. 
Rom
12:10  In brotherly love, tenderly loving
towards one another, in appreciation, giving preference to each other; 
Rom
12:11  not idle in duty, ardent in
spirit, serving the Master; 
Rom
12:12  rejoicing in the expectancy,
enduring under pressure, continuing steadfastly in prayer; 
Rom
12:13  imparting to the needs of the
set-apart ones, pursuing kindness towards strangers. 
Rom
12:14  Bless those who persecute you –
bless and do not curse. 
Rom
12:15  Rejoice with those who rejoice, and
weep with those who weep. 
Rom
12:16  Be of the same mind toward one
another. Do not be proud in mind, but go along with the lowly. Do not be wise
in your own estimation. 
Rom
12:17  Repay no one evil for evil.
Respect what is right in the sight of all men. 
Rom
12:18  If possible, on your part, be at
peace with all men. 
Rom
12:19  Beloved, do not revenge
yourselves, but give place to the wrath, for it has been written, “Vengeance is
Mine, I shall repay,” says יהוה. 
Rom
12:20  “Instead, if your enemy hungers,
feed him; if he thirsts, give him a drink, for in so doing you shall heap coals
of fire on his head.” 
Rom
12:21  Do not be overcome by evil, but
overcome evil with good. 
Rom
13:1  Let every being be in subjection to
the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from Elohim, and
the authorities that exist are appointed by Elohim. 
Rom
13:2  So he who opposes the authority
withstands the institution of Elohim, and those who withstand shall bring
judgment on themselves. 
Rom
13:3  For those ruling are an object of
fear, not to good works, but to evil. Do you wish to be not afraid of the
authority? Do the good, and you shall have praise from it, 
Rom
13:4  for it is a servant of Elohim to
you for good. But if you do evil, be afraid, for it does not bear the sword in
vain. For it is a servant of Elohim, a revenger to execute wrath on him who
practises evil. 
Rom
13:5  Therefore, it is necessary to be
subject, not only because of wrath but also because of the conscience. 
Rom
13:6  For because of this you also pay
taxes, for they are servants of Elohim attending continually to these duties. 
Rom
13:7  Render therefore to all what is due to them: tax to whom tax is due,
toll to whom toll, fear to whom fear, respect to whom respect. 
Rom
13:8  Owe no one any matter except to love one another, for he who loves another has
filled the Torah. 
Rom
13:9  For this, “You shall not commit
adultery,” “You shall not murder,” “You shall not steal,” “You shall not bear
false witness,” “You shall not covet,” and if there is any other command, is
summed up in this word, “You shall love your neighbour as yourself.” 
Rom
13:10  Love does no evil to a neighbour.
Therefore, love is completion of the Torah. 
Rom
13:11  And do this, knowing the time, that it is already the hour for us to
wake up from sleep, for now our deliverance is nearer than when we did believe.

Rom
13:12  The night is far advanced, the day
has come near. So let us put off the works of darkness, and let us put on the
armour of light. 
Rom
13:13  Let us walk becomingly, as in the
day, not in wild parties and drunkenness, not in living together and
indecencies, not in fighting and envy, 
Rom
13:14  but put on the Master יהושע
Messiah, and make no provision for the lusts of the flesh. 
Rom
14:1  And receive him who is weak in the
belief, not criticising his thoughts.

Rom
14:2  One indeed believes to eat all food, but he who is weak eats only
vegetables. 
Rom
14:3  He that eats, let him not despise
him who does not eat, and he that does not eat, let him not judge him who eats,
for Elohim received him. 
Rom
14:4  Who are you that judges another’s
servant? To his own master he stands or falls. But he shall be made to stand,
for Elohim is able to make him stand. 
Rom
14:5  One indeed judges one day above
another, another judges every day alike.
Let each one be completely persuaded in his own mind. 
Rom
14:6  He who minds the day, minds it to יהוה.
And he who does not mind the day, to יהוה he does not
mind it. He who eats, eats to יהוה, for he gives Elohim
thanks. And he who does not eat, to יהוה he does not
eat, and gives Elohim thanks. 
Rom
14:7  For not one of us lives to himself,
and not one dies to himself. 
Rom
14:8  For both, if we live, we live unto
the Master, and if we die, we die unto the Master. Therefore, whether we live
or die, we are the Master’s. 
Rom
14:9  For unto this Messiah died and rose
and lived again, to rule over both the dead and the living. 
Rom
14:10  But why do you judge your brother?
Or why do you despise your brother? For we shall all stand before the judgment
seat of Messiah. 
Rom
14:11  For it has been written, “As I
live, says יהוה, every knee shall bow to Me, and every
tongue shall confess to Elohim.” 
Rom
14:12  Each one of us, therefore, shall
give account of himself to Elohim. 
Rom
14:13  Therefore let us not judge one
another any longer, but rather judge this, not to put an obstacle or a
stumbling-block in our brother’s way. 
Rom
14:14  I know and am persuaded in the
Master יהושע that none at all is common of
itself. But to him who regards whatever to be common, to him it is common. 
Rom
14:15  And if your brother is grieved
because of your food, you are no longer walking in love. Do not by your food
ruin the one for whom Messiah died. 
Rom
14:16  Do not then allow your good to be
spoken of as evil. 
Rom
14:17  For the reign of Elohim is not
eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Set-apart
Spirit. 
Rom
14:18  For he who is serving Messiah in
these matters is well-pleasing to
Elohim and approved by men. 
Rom
14:19  So, then, let us pursue the matters of peace and the matters for building up one another. 
Rom
14:20  Do not destroy the work of Elohim
for the sake of food. All indeed are clean, but evil to that man who eats so as
to cause stumbling. 
Rom
14:21  It is good not to eat meat or
drink wine, nor to do whatever by
which your brother stumbles. 
Rom
14:22  Do you have belief? Have it to
yourself before Elohim. Blessed is he who does not condemn himself in what he
approves. 
Rom
14:23  But he who doubts, if he eats, is
condemned, because it is not of belief, and all that is not of belief is sin. 
Rom
15:1  But we who are strong ought to bear
with the failings of the weak, and not to please ourselves. 
Rom
15:2  Let each one of us please his
neighbour for his good, to build him up. 
Rom
15:3  For even the Messiah did not please
Himself, but, as it has been written, “The reproaches of those who reproached
You fell upon Me.” 
Rom
15:4  For whatever was written before was
written for our instruction, that through endurance and encouragement of the
Scriptures we might have the expectation.
Rom
15:5  And the Elohim of endurance and
encouragement give you to be of the same mind toward one another, according to
Messiah יהושע, 
Rom
15:6  that with one mind and one mouth,
you might praise the Elohim and Father of our Master יהושע
Messiah. 
Rom
15:7  So accept one another, as Messiah
also did accept us, to the esteem of Elohim. 
Rom
15:8  And I say that יהושע
Messiah has become a servant of the circumcised for the truth of Elohim, to
confirm the promises made to the fathers, 
Rom
15:9  and for the gentiles to praise
Elohim for His compassion, as it has been written, “Because of this I shall
confess to You among the gentiles, and I shall sing to Your Name.” 
Rom
15:10  And again it says, “Rejoice, O
gentiles, with His people!” 
Rom
15:11  And again, “Praise יהוה,
all you gentiles! Praise Him, all you peoples!” 
Rom
15:12  And again, Yeshayahu says, “There
shall be a root of Yishai, and He who shall rise to reign over the gentiles, on
Him the gentiles shall set their expectation.” 
Rom
15:13  And the Elohim of expectation fill
you with all joy and peace in believing, that you overflow with expectation by
the power of the Set-apart Spirit. 
Rom
15:14  Now I myself am persuaded
concerning you, my brothers, that you too are filled with goodness, complete in
all knowledge, able also to admonish one another. 
Rom
15:15  But I have written more boldly to
you, in part, as reminding you, because of the favour given to me by Elohim, 
Rom
15:16  to be a servant of יהושע
Messiah to the gentiles, with the priestly duty of bringing the Good News of
Elohim, so that the offering of the gentiles becomes acceptable, set apart by
the Set-apart Spirit. 
Rom
15:17  Therefore I have cause for
boasting in Messiah יהושע in the matters pertaining to Elohim. 
Rom
15:18  For I shall not presume to speak
of any matter except what Messiah has
worked out through me, in word and deed, to make the gentiles obedient, 
Rom
15:19  in power of signs and wonders, in
power of the Spirit of Elohim, so that from Yerushalayim and round about to
Illurikon I have completed the preaching of the Good News of Messiah. 
Rom
15:20  And so I was ambitious to bring
the Good News where Messiah had not been named, lest I should build on another
man’s foundation, 
Rom
15:21  but as it has been written, “To
whom it was not announced concerning Him, they shall see, and those that have
not heard shall understand.” 
Rom
15:22  This is why I was often hindered
from coming to you. 
Rom
15:23  But now, no longer having a place
in these parts, and having a longing to come to you for many years, 
Rom
15:24  I shall come to you when I go to
Spain. For I expect to see you on my journey, and to be helped on my way there
by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your company. 
Rom
15:25  But now I am going to Yerushalayim
to serve the set-apart ones. 
Rom
15:26  For it pleased those from
Makedonia and Achaia to make some contribution for the poor among the set-apart
ones who are in Yerushalayim. 
Rom
15:27  For they were pleased, and they
are their debtors. For if the gentiles have shared in their spiritual matters,
their duty is also to serve them in material matters. 
Rom
15:28  Having completed this, then, and
having put my seal on this fruit of theirs, I shall return through you to
Spain. 
Rom
15:29  And I know that when I come to
you, I shall come in the completeness of the blessing of the Good News of
Messiah. 
Rom
15:30  But I urge you, brothers, through
our Master יהושע Messiah, and through the love of
the Spirit, to strive together with me in prayers for me, unto Elohim, 
Rom
15:31  that I might be delivered from those
in Yehuḏah who do not believe, and that my service for Yerushalayim be
well received by the set-apart ones, 
Rom
15:32  that I might come to you with joy,
through the desire of Elohim, and be refreshed together with you. 
Rom
15:33  And the Elohim of peace be with
you all. Amĕn. 
Rom
16:1  And I commend to you Phoebe our
sister, who is a servant of the assembly in Kenḥrea, 
Rom
16:2  that you receive her in יהוה,
worthy of the set-apart ones, and assist her in whatever matter she has need of
you. For she has been a great help to many, including me. 
Rom
16:3  Greet Priscilla and Aqulas, my
fellow workers in Messiah יהושע, 
Rom
16:4  who risked their own necks for my
life, to whom not only I give thanks, but also all the assemblies of the
gentiles, 
Rom
16:5  and the assembly that is in their
house. Greet my beloved Epainetos, who is the first-fruits of Achaia to
Messiah. 
Rom
16:6  Greet Miryam, who worked very hard
for us. 
Rom
16:7  Greet Andronikos and Junias, my
relatives and my fellow prisoners, who are eminent among the emissaries, who
also were in Messiah before me. 
Rom
16:8  Greet Amplias, my beloved in יהוה.

Rom
16:9  Greet Urbanus, our fellow worker in
Messiah, and Stachus, my beloved. 
Rom
16:10  Greet Apelles, the approved in
Messiah. Greet those who are of Aristobulos. 
Rom
16:11  Greet Herodion, my relative. Greet
those who are of Narcissus who are in יהוה. 
Rom
16:12  Greet Truphaina and Truphosa, who
work in יהוה. Greet the beloved Persis, who worked very
hard in יהוה. 
Rom
16:13  Greet Rufus, chosen in יהוה
and his mother and mine. 
Rom
16:14  Greet Asugritos, Phlegon, Hermas,
Patrobas, Hermes, and the brothers who are with them. 
Rom
16:15  Greet Philologos and Julia, Nereus
and his sister, and Olumpas, and all the set-apart ones who are with them. 
Rom
16:16  Greet one another with a set-apart
kiss. The assemblies of Messiah greet you. 
Rom
16:17  Now I call upon you, brothers,
watch out for those who cause divisions and stumbling, contrary to the teaching
which you learned, and turn away from them. 
Rom
16:18  For such ones do not serve our
Master יהושע Messiah, but their own stomach, and
by smooth words and flattering speech they deceive the hearts of the innocent. 
Rom
16:19  Your obedience, indeed, is
reported to all. Therefore I rejoice concerning you, but I wish you to be wise
indeed as to the good, and simple toward the evil. 
Rom
16:20  And the Elohim of peace shall
crush Satan under your feet shortly. The favour of our Master יהושע
Messiah be with you. Amĕn. 
Rom
16:21  Timothy, my fellow worker, and
Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater, my relatives, greet you. 
Rom
16:22  I, Tertius, who wrote this letter,
greet you in יהוה. 
Rom
16:23  Gaios, the host of all the
assembly and me, greets you. Ĕrastos, the treasurer of the city, greets
you, and Quartus, a brother. 
Rom
16:24  The favour of our Master יהושע
Messiah be with you all. Amĕn. 
Rom
16:25  And to Him who is able to
establish you according to my Good News and the preaching of יהושע
Messiah, according to the revelation of the secret which was kept silent since
times of old, 
Rom
16:26  but now has been made manifest,
and by the prophetic Scriptures has been made known to all nations, according
to the command of the everlasting Elohim, for belief-obedience. 
Rom
16:27  To Elohim, wise alone, be the
esteem, through יהושע Messiah forever. Amĕn.
