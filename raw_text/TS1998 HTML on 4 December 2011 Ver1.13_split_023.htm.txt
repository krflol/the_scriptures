Estĕr/Esther
Esther
1:1  And it came to be in the days of
Aḥashwĕrosh – he is the Aḥashwĕrosh who reigned from
India to Kush, a hundred and twenty-seven provinces – 
Esther
1:2  in those days, when Sovereign
Aḥashwĕrosh sat on the throne of his reign, which was in the citadel
of Shushan, 
Esther
1:3  that in the third year of his reign
he made a feast for all his officials and servants. The power of Persia and
Media, the nobles and the princes of the provinces were before him, 
Esther
1:4  when he showed the riches of his
esteemed reign and the splendour of his excellent greatness for many days, a
hundred and eighty days. 
Esther
1:5  And when these days were completed,
the sovereign made a feast lasting seven days for all the people who were
present in the citadel of Shushan, from great to small, in the courtyard of the
garden of the sovereign’s palace. 
Esther
1:6  White and blue tapestries were
fastened with cords of fine linen and purple on silver rods and marble columns –
the couches were of gold and silver on a mosaic pavement of porphyry, marble,
mother-of-pearl, and black marble. 
Esther
1:7  And they served drinks in golden
vessels, the vessels being different from one another, with much royal wine,
according to the hand of the sovereign. 
Esther
1:8  And drinking was according to the
law, no one was compelled, for so the sovereign had ordered all the officers of
his house, that they should do according to each one’s pleasure. 
Esther
1:9  Sovereigness Vashti also made a
feast for the women in the royal palace which Sovereign Aḥashwĕrosh
owned. 
Esther
1:10  On the seventh day, when the heart
of the sovereign was glad with wine, he ordered Mehuman, Biztha, Ḥarḇona,
Biḡtha, and Aḇaḡtha, Zĕthar, and Karkas, the seven
eunuchs who were in attendance in the presence of Sovereign Aḥashwĕrosh,
Esther
1:11  to bring Sovereigness Vashti before
the sovereign, with her royal crown, in order to show her loveliness to the
people and the officials, for she was lovely to look upon. 
Esther
1:12  But Sovereigness Vashti refused to
come at the sovereign’s command brought by his eunuchs. And the sovereign was
very wroth, and his rage burned within him.
Esther
1:13  So the sovereign said to the wise
men who understood the times (for in this way the sovereign’s matter came before all who knew law and
right-ruling, 
Esther
1:14  and who were close to him:
Karshena, Shĕthar, Aḏmatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, Memuḵan,
the seven princes of Persia and Media, who saw the sovereign’s face, who sat
first in the reign): 
Esther
1:15  “According to law, what is to be
done to Sovereigness Vashti, because she did not perform the command of
Sovereign Aḥashwĕrosh, through the eunuchs?” 
Esther
1:16  And Memuḵan answered before
the sovereign and the princes, “Sovereigness Vashti has misbehaved not only
toward the sovereign, but also toward all the princes, and all the people who
are in all the provinces of Sovereign Aḥashwĕrosh. 
Esther
1:17  “For the matter of the sovereigness
shall go forth to all women, to make their husbands despised in their eyes,
when they say, ‘Sovereign Aḥashwĕrosh commanded Sovereigness Vashti
to be brought in before him, but she did not come.’ 
Esther
1:18  “And this day the princesses of
Persia and Media shall say to all the sovereign’s officials that they have
heard of the matter of the sovereigness – with plenty of scorn and wrath. 
Esther
1:19  “If it pleases the sovereign, let a
royal decree go out from him, and let it be recorded in the laws of the
Persians and the Medes, so that it does not pass away, that Vashti shall come
no more before Sovereign Aḥashwĕrosh. And let the sovereign give her
royal position to another who is better than she. 
Esther
1:20  “And the sovereign’s decree which
he makes shall be proclaimed throughout all his rule, great as it is, and all
the wives give esteem to their husbands, both great and small.” 
Esther
1:21  And the word was good in the eyes
of the sovereign and the princes, and the sovereign did according to the word
of Memuḵan. 
Esther
1:22  So he sent letters to all the
sovereign’s provinces, to each province in its own writing, and to every people
in their own language, that each man should be master in his own house and
speak in the language of his people. 
Esther
2:1  After these events, when the wrath
of Sovereign Aḥashwĕrosh had ceased, he remembered Vashti, what she
had done, and what had been decreed against her. 
Esther
2:2  Then the sovereign’s servants who
attended him said, “Let lovely young maidens be sought for the sovereign, 
Esther
2:3  and let the sovereign appoint
officers in all the provinces of his reign, and let them gather all the lovely
young maidens to the citadel of Shushan, into the women’s quarters, under the
hand of Hĕḡai the sovereign’s eunuch, guardian of the women, to give
their preparations. 
Esther
2:4  “And let the young woman who pleases
the sovereign be sovereigness instead of Vashti.” And the word pleased the
sovereign, and he did so. 
Esther
2:5  In the citadel of Shushan there was
a certain man, a Yehuḏite whose name was Mordeḵai son of Ya’ir, son
of Shim‛i, son of Qish, a Binyamite, 
Esther
2:6  who had been exiled from
Yerushalayim with the captives who had been exiled with Yeḵonyah
sovereign of Yehuḏah, whom Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar the
sovereign of Baḇel had exiled. 
Esther
2:7  And it came to be that he was
raising Haḏassah, that is Estĕr, his uncle’s daughter, for she had
neither father nor mother. The young woman was lovely and of good appearance.
And when her father and mother died, Mordeḵai took her as his own
daughter. 
Esther
2:8  And it came to be, when the
sovereign’s command and decree were heard, and when many young women were
gathered at the citadel of Shushan, into the hand of Hĕḡai, that Estĕr,
too, was taken to the sovereign’s palace, into the hand of Hĕḡai,
guardian of the women. 
Esther
2:9  And the young woman pleased him, and
she received kindness from him. So he hastened to give her preparations and her
portions, and gave her seven choice female servants from the sovereign’s
palace. And he moved her and her female servants to the best place in the house of the women. 
Esther
2:10  Estĕr had not made known her
people or her relatives, for Mordeḵai had commanded her not to make it
known. 
Esther
2:11  And every day Mordeḵai walked
about in front of the courtyard of the women’s quarters, to learn of Estĕr’s
welfare and what is done to her. 
Esther
2:12  Now when the turn of each young
woman came to go in to Sovereign Aḥashwĕrosh after she had completed
twelve months according to the regulations for the women – for the days of
their preparation were completed as follows: six months with oil of myrrh, and
six months with perfumes and with the preparations of women – 
Esther
2:13  thus prepared, the young woman went
to the sovereign, and whatever she asked for was given to take with her from
the house of the women to the sovereign’s palace. 
Esther
2:14  In the evening she went, and in the
morning she returned to the second house of the women, into the hand of Sha‛ashgaz,
the sovereign’s eunuch, guardian of the concubines. She would not come in to
the sovereign again unless the sovereign delighted in her and called for her by
name.
Esther
2:15  And when the turn came for Estĕr,
the daughter of Aḇihayil the uncle of Mordeḵai, who had taken her
as his daughter, to come in to the sovereign, she sought no matter but what Hĕḡai
the sovereign’s eunuch, guardian of the women, advised. And Estĕr found
favour in the eyes of all who saw her. 
Esther
2:16  And Estĕr was taken to
Sovereign Aḥashwĕrosh, into his royal palace, in the tenth month,
which is the month of Tĕḇĕth, in the seventh year of his reign.

Esther
2:17  And the sovereign loved Estĕr
more than all the women, and she found favour and kindness in his eyes more
than all the maidens. And he set the royal crown upon her head and made her
sovereigness instead of Vashti. 
Esther
2:18  And the sovereign made a great
feast, the Feast of Estĕr, for all his officials and servants. And he
proclaimed a release in the provinces and gave gifts according to the means of
a sovereign. 
Esther
2:19  And when maidens were assembled a
second time, Mordeḵai sat within the sovereign’s gate. 
Esther
2:20  Estĕr had not made known her
relatives and her people yet, as
Mordeḵai commanded her, for Estĕr obeyed the command of Mordeḵai
as when she was being raised by him. 
Esther
2:21  In those days, while Mordeḵai
sat within the sovereign’s gate, two of the sovereign’s eunuchs, Biḡthan
and Teresh, doorkeepers, were wroth and sought to lay hands on Sovereign
Aḥashwĕrosh. 
Esther
2:22  And the matter became known to
Mordeḵai, who informed Sovereigness Estĕr, and Estĕr spoke to
the sovereign in Mordeḵai’s name. 
Esther
2:23  And when the matter was searched
into, it was confirmed, and both were impaled on a stake. And it was written in
the book of the annals in the presence of the sovereign. 
Esther
3:1  After these events Sovereign
Aḥashwĕrosh promoted Haman, son of Hammeḏatha the Aḡaḡite,
and exalted him and seated him higher than all the princes with him. 
Esther
3:2  And all the sovereign’s servants who
were in the sovereign’s gate bowed and did obeisance to Haman, for so the
sovereign had commanded concerning him. But Mordeḵai would not bow or do
obeisance. 
Esther
3:3  And the sovereign’s servants who
were in the sovereign’s gate said to Mordeḵai, “Why do you disobey the
sovereign’s command?” 
Esther
3:4  And it came to be, when they spoke
to him daily and he would not listen to them, that they told Haman, to see
whether the words of Mordeḵai would stand – for he had told them that he
was a Yehuḏite. 
Esther
3:5  And when Haman saw that Mordeḵai
did not bow or do obeisance, Haman was filled with wrath. 
Esther
3:6  But it was despicable in his eyes to
lay hands on Mordeḵai alone, for they had informed him of the people of
Mordeḵai. Therefore Haman sought to destroy all the Yehuḏim who
were throughout all the reign of Aḥashwĕrosh, the people of Mordeḵai.

Esther
3:7  In the first month, which is the
month of Nisan, in the twelfth year of Sovereign Aḥashwĕrosh,
someone cast Pur – that is, the lot – before Haman from day to day, and from
month to month, until it fell on the twelfth month, which is the month of Aḏar.

Esther
3:8  Haman then told Sovereign
Aḥashwĕrosh, “There is a certain people scattered and dispersed
among the people in all the provinces of your reign, whose laws are different
from all people, and they do not do the sovereign’s laws. Therefore it is not
in the sovereign’s interest to let them remain. 
Esther
3:9  “If it pleases the sovereign, let a
decree be written to destroy them, and let me pay ten thousand talents of
silver into the hands of those who do the work, to bring it into the sovereign’s
treasuries.” 
Esther
3:10  And the sovereign took his signet
ring from his hand and gave it to Haman, son of Hammeḏatha the Aḡaḡite,
the enemy of the Yehuḏim. 
Esther
3:11  And the sovereign said to Haman, “The
silver and the people are given to you, to do with them as seems good to you.” 
Esther
3:12  And the sovereign’s scribes were
called on the thirteenth day of the first month, and a decree was written
according to all that Haman commanded – to the viceroys of the sovereign, and
to the governors who were over each province, and to the officials of all
people, to every province according to its writing, and to every people in
their language. It was written in the name of Sovereign Aḥashwĕrosh,
and sealed with the sovereign’s signet ring. 
Esther
3:13  And the letters were sent by the
runners into all the sovereign’s provinces, to cut off, to slay, and to destroy
all the Yehuḏim, both young and old, little children and women, in one
day, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Aḏar,
and to plunder their possessions. 
Esther
3:14  A copy of the writing, to be made
law in every province, was published for all people, to be ready for that day. 
Esther
3:15  The runners went out, hastened by
the sovereign’s command, and the decree was given out in the citadel of
Shushan. The sovereign and Haman then sat down to drink, but the city of
Shushan was in confusion. 
Esther
4:1  And Mordeḵai learned of all
that had been done, and Mordeḵai tore his garments and put on sackcloth
and ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried out with a loud
and bitter cry. 
Esther
4:2  And he went up to the front of the
sovereign’s gate, for no one might enter the sovereign’s gate wearing
sackcloth. 
Esther
4:3  And in every province where the
sovereign’s command and decree came, there was great mourning among the Yehuḏim,
and fasting, and weeping, and wailing. And many lay in sackcloth and ashes. 
Esther
4:4  And Estĕr’s young women and
eunuchs came and told her, and the sovereigness was deeply pained, and sent
garments to Mordeḵai to wear, and to take away his sackcloth from him,
but he refused. 
Esther
4:5  And Estĕr called Hathaḵ,
one of the sovereign’s eunuchs whom he had appointed to attend her, and she
gave him a command concerning Mordeḵai, to learn what and why this was. 
Esther
4:6  And Hathaḵ went out to Mordeḵai,
to an open space of the city, in front of the sovereign’s gate. 
Esther
4:7  And Mordeḵai told him all that
befell him, and all about the silver that Haman promised to pay into the
sovereign’s treasuries to destroy the Yehuḏim. 
Esther
4:8  And he gave him a copy of the
written decree to destroy them, which was given at Shushan, to show it to Estĕr
and explain it to her, and to command her to go in to the sovereign to make
supplication to him, and plead before him for her people. 
Esther
4:9  And Hathaḵ came and told Estĕr
the words of Mordeḵai. 
Esther
4:10  And Estĕr spoke to Hathaḵ,
and gave him a command for Mordeḵai, 
Esther
4:11  “All the sovereign’s servants and
the people of the sovereign’s provinces know that any man or woman who goes
into the inner court to the sovereign, who has not been called, he has but one
law: to be put to death, except the one to whom the sovereign holds out the
golden sceptre, who then shall live. But I have not been called to come in to
the sovereign these thirty days.” 
Esther
4:12  And they declared to Mordeḵai
the words of Estĕr. 
Esther
4:13  And Mordeḵai commanded them
to answer Estĕr, “Do not think within yourself to escape in the sovereign’s
palace any more than all the other Yehuḏim. 
Esther
4:14  “For if you keep entirely silent at
this time, relief and deliverance shall arise for the Yehuḏim from another
place, while you and your father’s house perish. And who knows whether you have
come to the reign for such a time as this?” 
Esther
4:15  And Estĕr commanded to reply
to Mordeḵai, 
Esther
4:16  “Go, gather all the Yehuḏim
who are present in Shushan, and fast for me, and do not eat or drink for three
days, night or day. I too, and my young women shall fast in the same way, then
I shall go to the sovereign, which is against the law. And if I shall perish, I
shall perish!” 
Esther
4:17  Mordeḵai then went away and
did according to all that Estĕr commanded him. 
Esther
5:1  And it came to be on the third day
that Estĕr put on royal apparel and stood in the inner court of the
sovereign’s palace, in front of the sovereign’s house, while the sovereign sat
on his royal throne in the royal house, opposite the entrance of the house. 
Esther
5:2  And it came to be, when the
sovereign saw Sovereigness Estĕr standing in the court, that she found
favour in his eyes, and the sovereign held out to Estĕr the golden sceptre
which was in his hand. And Estĕr went near and touched the top of the
sceptre. 
Esther
5:3  And the sovereign said to her, “What
is it, Sovereigness Estĕr, and what is your request? Up to half my reign,
and it is given to you!” 
Esther
5:4  And Estĕr answered, “If it
pleases the sovereign, let the sovereign and Haman come today to the feast
which I have prepared for him.” 
Esther
5:5  And the sovereign said, “Get Haman
at once, to do as Estĕr has said.” Then the sovereign and Haman went to
the feast which Estĕr had prepared. 
Esther
5:6  And the sovereign said to Estĕr
at the feast of wine, “What is your petition? And it is given you. And what is
your request? Up to half my reign, and it is done!” 
Esther
5:7  And Estĕr answered and said, “My
petition and request is this: 
Esther
5:8  “If I have found favour in the eyes
of the sovereign, and if it pleases the sovereign to give my petition and
perform my request, then let the sovereign and Haman come to the feast which I
make for them, and tomorrow I shall do according to the word of the sovereign.”

Esther
5:9  And Haman went out that day
rejoicing and with a glad heart. But when Haman saw Mordeḵai in the
sovereign’s gate, and that he did not stand or tremble before him, he was
filled with wrath against Mordeḵai. 
Esther
5:10  But Haman held himself in, and came
to his house, and he sent and called for his friends and Zeresh his wife. 
Esther
5:11  And Haman recounted to them the
esteem of his wealth, and his many sons, and all in which the sovereign had
promoted him, and how he had exalted him above the officials and servants of
the sovereign. 
Esther
5:12  And Haman said, “Besides, Estĕr
the sovereigness let no one but me come in with the sovereign to the feast
which she prepared. And tomorrow too I am invited by her, along with the
sovereign. 
Esther
5:13  “But all this does not suit me, as
long as I see Mordeḵai the Yehuḏite sitting at the sovereign’s
gate.” 
Esther
5:14  So his wife Zeresh and all his
friends said to him, “Let a stake be made, fifty cubits high, and in the
morning speak to the sovereign that Mordeḵai be impaled on it. And go
with the sovereign to the feast, rejoicing.” And the word pleased Haman, and he
had the stake made. 
Esther
6:1  On that night the sleep of the
sovereign fled, and he commanded to bring the book of the records of the
annals. And they were read before the sovereign. 
Esther
6:2  And it was found written that Mordeḵai
had told of Biḡthana and Teresh, two of the sovereign’s eunuchs, the
doorkeepers who had sought to lay hands on Sovereign Aḥashwĕrosh. 
Esther
6:3  Then the sovereign said, “What has
been done in value or in greatness to Mordeḵai for this?” And the
sovereign’s servants who attended him said, “Naught has been done for him.” 
Esther
6:4  And the sovereign said, “Who is in
the court?” Now Haman had come into the outer court of the sovereign’s palace
to speak to the sovereign to impale Mordeḵai on the stake that he had
prepared for him. 
Esther
6:5  And the sovereign’s servants said to
him, “Look, Haman is standing in the court.” And the sovereign said, “Let him
come in.” 
Esther
6:6  And when Haman came in, the
sovereign asked him, “What is to be done for the man whom the sovereign
delights to value?” Now Haman thought in his heart, “Whom would the sovereign delight
to value more than me?” 
Esther
6:7  And Haman answered the sovereign, “For
the man whom the sovereign delights to value, 
Esther
6:8  let a royal robe be brought which
the sovereign has worn, and a horse on which the sovereign has ridden, one with
a royal crest placed on its head. 
Esther
6:9  “And let this robe and horse be
given into the hand of one of the sovereign’s most noble princes. Let them
dress the man whom the sovereign delights to value. And make him ride on
horseback through the city square, and proclaim before him, ‘Thus it is done to
the man whom the sovereign delights to value!’ ” 
Esther
6:10  And the sovereign said to Haman, “Hurry,
take the robe and the horse, as you have spoken, and do so for Mordeḵai
the Yehuḏite who sits in the sovereign’s gate. Let no word fail of all
that you have spoken.” 
Esther
6:11  And Haman took the robe and the
horse, and robed Mordeḵai and led him on horseback through the city
square, and proclaimed before him, “Thus it is done to the man the sovereign
delights to value.” 
Esther
6:12  Then Mordeḵai went back to
the sovereign’s gate. But Haman hurried to his house, mourning and with covered
head. 
Esther
6:13  And when Haman related to his wife
Zeresh and all his friends all that had befallen him, his wise men and his wife
Zeresh said to him, “If Mordeḵai, before whom you have begun to fall, is
from the seed of the Yehuḏim, you are not going to prevail against him
but certainly fall before him.” 
Esther
6:14  While they were still speaking with
him, the sovereign’s eunuchs came, and hurried to bring Haman to the feast
which Estĕr had prepared. 
Esther
7:1  And the sovereign and Haman came in,
to drink with Sovereigness Estĕr. 
Esther
7:2  And again on the second day, at the
feast of wine, the sovereign said to Estĕr, “What is your petition,
Sovereigness Estĕr? And it is given to you. And what is your request? Up
to half my reign, and it is done!”
Esther
7:3  And Sovereigness Estĕr answered
and said, “If I have found favour in your eyes, O sovereign, and if it pleases
the sovereign, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my
request. 
Esther
7:4  “For we have been sold, my people
and I, to be cut off, to be slain, and to be destroyed. And if we had been sold
as male and female slaves, I would have kept silent, although the adversary
could not make up for the sovereign’s loss.” 
Esther
7:5  Then Sovereign Aḥashwĕrosh
asked Sovereigness Estĕr, “Who is he, and where is he, whose heart is set
to do so?” 
Esther
7:6  And Estĕr said, “The adversary
and enemy is this evil Haman!” Then Haman was afraid before the sovereign and
sovereigness. 
Esther
7:7  And the sovereign, arising in his
wrath from the feast of wine, went into
the palace garden. And Haman remained before Sovereigness Estĕr, pleading
for his life, for he saw that evil had been decided against him by the
sovereign. 
Esther
7:8  And when the sovereign returned from
the palace garden to the place of the feast of wine, Haman was falling on the
couch where Estĕr was. Then the sovereign said, “Also to ravish the
sovereigness while I am in the house?” As the word left the sovereign’s mouth,
they covered Haman’s face. 
Esther
7:9  And Ḥarḇonah, one of the
eunuchs, said to the sovereign, “Also, see the stake, fifty cubits high, which
Haman made for Mordeḵai, who spoke good on behalf of the sovereign, is
standing at the house of Haman.” And the sovereign said, “Impale him on it!”  
Esther
7:10  And they impaled Haman on the stake
that he had prepared for Mordeḵai, and the sovereign’s wrath abated. 
Esther
8:1  On that day Sovereign Aḥashwĕrosh
gave to Sovereigness Estĕr the house of Haman, the adversary of the Yehuḏim.
And Mordeḵai came before the sovereign, for Estĕr had explained what
he was to her. 
Esther
8:2  And the sovereign took off his
signet ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it to Mordeḵai. And
Estĕr appointed Mordeḵai over the house of Haman. 
Esther
8:3  And Estĕr spoke to the
sovereign again, and fell down at his feet and begged him with tears to put an
end to the evil of Haman the Aḡaḡite, and his plot which he had
plotted against the Yehuḏim. 
Esther
8:4  And the sovereign held out the
golden sceptre toward Estĕr. And Estĕr arose and stood before the sovereign,

Esther
8:5  and said, “If it pleases the
sovereign, and if I have found favour in his sight and the matter is right
before the sovereign and I am pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to bring
back the letters, the plot by Haman, son of Hammeḏatha the Aḡaḡite,
which he wrote to destroy the Yehuḏim who are in all the sovereign’s
provinces. 
Esther
8:6  “For how could I bear to see the
evil coming to my people? Or how could I bear to see the destruction of my
relatives?” 
Esther
8:7  And Sovereign Aḥashwĕrosh
said to Sovereigness Estĕr and Mordeḵai the Yehuḏite, “Look, I
have given Estĕr the house of Haman, and they have impaled him on the
stake because he laid his hand on the Yehuḏim. 
Esther
8:8  “Now you write on behalf of the Yehuḏim,
as it pleases you, in the sovereign’s name, and seal it with the sovereign’s
signet ring. For a letter which is written in the sovereign’s name and sealed
with the sovereign’s signet ring no one turns back.” 
Esther
8:9  So the sovereign’s scribes were
called at that time, in the third month, which is the month of Siwan, on the
twenty-third day. And it was written, according to all that Mordeḵai
commanded to the Yehuḏim, and to the viceroys, and the governors, and the
princes of the provinces from India to Kush, a hundred and twenty-seven
provinces, to every province in its own writing, to every people in their own
language, and to the Yehuḏim in their own writing, and in their own
language. 
Esther
8:10  And he wrote in the name of
Sovereign Aḥashwĕrosh, and sealed it with the sovereign’s signet
ring, and sent letters by runners on horseback, riding on royal horses bred
from speedy mares: 
Esther
8:11  That the sovereign has granted to
the Yehuḏim who were in every city to be assembled and stand for their
lives – to cut off, to slay, and to destroy all the power of the people or
province that would distress them, little children and women, and to plunder
their possessions, 
Esther
8:12  on one day in all the provinces of
Sovereign Aḥashwĕrosh, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month,
which is the month of Aḏar. 
Esther
8:13  The copy of the writing to be made
law in every province was announced to all the peoples, so that the Yehuḏim
would be ready on that day to be avenged on their enemies.
Esther
8:14  The runners, riding on royal
horses, went out, hastened and pressed on by the sovereign’s command. And the
decree was given out in the citadel of Shushan. 
Esther
8:15  And Mordeḵai went out from
the presence of the sovereign wearing royal garments of blue and white, with a
great crown of gold and a garment of fine linen and purple. And the city of
Shushan rejoiced and was glad. 
Esther
8:16  For the Yehuḏim there was
light and gladness and joy and value. 
Esther
8:17  And in every province and in every
city where the sovereign’s command and decree came, the Yehuḏim had joy
and gladness, a feast and a good day. And many of the people of the land were
becoming Yehuḏim, for the fear of the Yehuḏim had fallen upon them.

Esther
9:1  And in the twelfth month, that is,
the month of Aḏar, on the thirteenth day, when the sovereign’s command
and his decree came to be done, on the day that the enemies of the Yehuḏim
had waited to overpower them, it turned around, so that the Yehuḏim
overpowered those who hated them.
Esther
9:2  The Yehuḏim assembled in their
cities, throughout all the provinces of Sovereign Aḥashwĕrosh to lay
hands on those who sought their evil. And no one stood against them, because
fear of them fell upon all people. 
Esther
9:3  And all the officials of the
provinces, and the viceroys, and the governors, and all those doing the
sovereign’s work, helped the Yehuḏim, because the fear of Mordeḵai
fell upon them. 
Esther
9:4  For Mordeḵai was great in the
palace of the sovereign, and his report spread into all the provinces, for this
man Mordeḵai became greater and greater. 
Esther
9:5  And the Yehuḏim smote all
their enemies with the stroke of the sword, with slaughter and destruction, and
did what they pleased to those who hated them. 
Esther
9:6  And in the citadel of Shushan the
Yehuḏim slew and destroyed five hundred men. 
Esther
9:7  And they slew Parshandatha, and
Dalphon, and Aspatha, 
Esther
9:8  and Poratha, and Aḏalya, and
Ariḏatha, 
Esther
9:9  and Parmashta, and Arisai, and Ariḏai,
and Wayezatha, 
Esther
9:10  the ten sons of Haman son of Hammeḏatha,
the enemy of the Yehuḏim. But they did not lay a hand on the plunder. 
Esther
9:11  On that day the number of those who
were slain in the citadel of Shushan came before the sovereign. 
Esther
9:12  And the sovereign said to
Sovereigness Estĕr, “The Yehuḏim have slain and destroyed five
hundred men in the citadel of Shushan, and the ten sons of Haman. What have
they done in the rest of the sovereign’s provinces? And what is your petition?
And it is given to you. And what is your further request? And it is done.” 
Esther
9:13  And Estĕr said, “If it pleases
the sovereign, let it be given to the Yehuḏim who are in Shushan to do
again tomorrow according to today’s decree, and let Haman’s ten sons be impaled
on the stake.” 
Esther
9:14  And the sovereign commanded this to
be done. And the decree was given in Shushan, and they impaled Haman’s ten
sons. 
Esther
9:15  And the Yehuḏim who were in
Shushan also assembled on the fourteenth day of the month of Aḏar and
they slew three hundred men at Shushan. But they did not lay a hand on the
plunder. 
Esther
9:16  And the rest of the Yehuḏim
in the sovereign’s provinces assembled and stood for their lives, and to get
rest from their enemies, and to slay seventy-five thousand of their enemies.
But they did not lay a hand on the plunder. 
Esther
9:17  That
was on the thirteenth day of the month of Aḏar, and on the fourteenth
day of the month they rested and made it a day of feasting and gladness. 
Esther
9:18  But the Yehuḏim who were at
Shushan assembled on the thirteenth day, as well as on the fourteenth day. And
on the fifteenth day of the month they rested, and made it a day of feasting
and gladness. 
Esther
9:19  Therefore the Yehuḏim of the
villages who dwelt in the unwalled towns were making the fourteenth day of the
month of Aḏar a good day of gladness and feasting, and for sending
portions to one another. 
Esther
9:20  And Mordeḵai wrote these
matters and sent letters to all the Yehuḏim who were in all the provinces
of Sovereign Aḥashwĕrosh, both near and far, 
Esther
9:21  to establish among them, to observe
the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month of Aḏar, yearly, 
Esther
9:22  as the days on which the Yehuḏim
had rest from their enemies, as the month which was turned from sorrow to joy
for them, and from mourning to a good day, that they should make them days of
feasting and joy, of sending portions to one another and gifts to the poor. 
Esther
9:23  And the Yehuḏim undertook to
do as they had begun, and as Mordeḵai had written to them, 
Esther
9:24  because Haman, son of Hammeḏatha
the Aḡaḡite, the adversary of all the Yehuḏim, had plotted
against the Yehuḏim to destroy them, and had cast Pur – that is, the lot –
to crush them and to destroy them. 
Esther
9:25  But when she came before the
sovereign, he commanded by letter that his evil plot which Haman had plotted
against the Yehuḏim should return on his own head, and that he and his
sons should be impaled on the stake. 
Esther
9:26  Therefore they called these days
Purim, after the name Pur. Therefore, because of all the words of this letter,
what they had seen concerning this matter, and what had come upon them, 
Esther
9:27  the Yehuḏim established and
imposed it upon themselves and upon their seed and all who should join them,
that without fail they should observe these two days every year, according to
their writing and at their appointed time, 
Esther
9:28  and that these days should be
remembered and observed throughout every generation, every clan, every
province, and every city, and that these days of Purim should not fail from
among the Yehuḏim, and that the remembrance of them should not cease from
their seed. 
Esther
9:29  And Sovereigness Estĕr, the
daughter of Aḇiḥayil, with Mordeḵai the Yehuḏite, wrote
with all authority to confirm this second letter about Purim. 
Esther
9:30  And Mordeḵai sent letters to
all the Yehuḏim, to the hundred and twenty-seven provinces of the reign
of Aḥashwĕrosh, words of peace and truth, 
Esther
9:31  to establish these days of Purim at
their appointed times, as Mordeḵai the Yehuḏite and Sovereigness
Estĕr had established for them, and as they had established for themselves
and their seed concerning matters of their fastings and lamenting. 
Esther
9:32  And the decree of Estĕr
established these matters of Purim, and it was written in the book. 
Esther
10:1  And Sovereign Aḥashwĕrosh
laid compulsory labour on the land and the islands of the sea. 
Esther
10:2  And all the acts of his power and
his might, and the exact account of the greatness of Mordeḵai, with which
the sovereign made him great, are they not written in the book of the annals of
the sovereigns of Media and Persia? 
Esther
10:3  For Mordeḵai the Yehuḏite
was second to Sovereign Aḥashwĕrosh, and great among the Yehuḏim
and pleasing to his many brothers, seeking the good of his people and speaking
peace to all his seed.
