Titos/Titus
Titus
1:1  Sha’ul, a servant of Elohim and an
emissary of יהושע Messiah, according to the
belief of Elohim’s chosen ones and knowledge of the truth according to
reverence, 
Titus
1:2  in expectation of everlasting life
which Elohim, who does not lie, promised before times of old, 
Titus
1:3  but in its own times has manifested
His word through preaching, with which I was entrusted according to the command
of Elohim our Saviour, 
Titus
1:4  to Titus, a genuine child according
to our common belief: Favour, compassion, peace from Elohim the Father and the
Master יהושע Messiah our Saviour. 
Titus
1:5  The reason I left you in Crete was
that you should straighten out what was left undone, and appoint elders in
every city as I commanded you: 
Titus
1:6  if anyone is unreprovable, the
husband of one wife, having believing children not accused of loose behaviour,
or unruly. 
Titus
1:7  For an overseer has to be
unreprovable, as a managing one of Elohim, not self-pleasing, not wroth, not
given to wine, no brawler, not greedy for filthy gain, 
Titus
1:8  but kind to strangers, a lover of
what is good, sensible, righteous, set-apart, self-controlled, 
Titus
1:9  clinging to the trustworthy word,
according to the teaching, in order to be able both to encourage by sound
teaching, and to reprove those who oppose it.
Titus
1:10  For there are many unruly men,
senseless talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision, 
Titus
1:11  whose mouths have to be stopped,
who upset entire households, teaching what they should not teach, for the sake of filthy gain. 
Titus
1:12  One of them, a prophet of their
own, said, “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.” 
Titus
1:13  This witness is true. Therefore
rebuke them sharply, in order for them to be sound in the belief, 
Titus
1:14  not paying attention to Yehuḏite
fables, and commands of men who turn from the truth. 
Titus
1:15  Indeed, all matters are clean to the clean, but to those who are defiled and
unbelieving no matter is clean, but
both their mind and conscience are defiled. 
Titus
1:16  They profess to know Elohim, but in
works they deny Him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unfit for any good
work.
Titus
2:1  But you, speak what is fitting for
sound teaching: 
Titus
2:2  the older men are to be sober,
serious, sensible, sound in belief, in love, in endurance, 
Titus
2:3  the older women likewise are to be
set-apart in behaviour, not slanderers, not given to much wine, teachers of
what is good, 
Titus
2:4  in order for them to train the young
women to love their husbands, to love their children, 
Titus
2:5  to be sensible, blameless, workers
at home, good, subject to their own husbands, in order that the word of Elohim
is not evil spoken of. 
Titus
2:6  Likewise urge the young men to be
sensible. 
Titus
2:7  Show yourself to them an example of good works in all matters. In teaching show
uncorruptness, seriousness,
Titus
2:8  soundness of speech beyond reproach,
in order that the opponent is put to shame, having no evil word to say about you. 
Titus
2:9  Servants should be subject to their
own masters, to be well-pleasing in every way, not back-talking, 
Titus
2:10  not stealing, but showing all good
trustworthiness, so that they adorn the teaching of Elohim our Saviour in every
way. 
Titus
2:11  For the saving Gift of Elohim has
appeared to all men, 
Titus
2:12  instructing us to renounce
wickedness and worldly lusts, and to live sensibly, righteously, and reverently
in the present age, 
Titus
2:13  looking for the blessed expectation
and esteemed appearance of the great Elohim and our Saviour יהושע
Messiah, 
Titus
2:14  who gave Himself for us, to redeem
us from all lawlessness and to cleanse for Himself a people, His own possession, ardent for good
works.
Titus
2:15  Speak these matters, urge, and reprove with all authority. Let no one despise
you.
Titus
3:1  Remind them to be subject to rulers
and authorities, to obey, to be ready for every good work, 
Titus
3:2  not to slander anyone, not to be
quarrelsome, to be gentle, showing all meekness to all men. 
Titus
3:3  For we ourselves were also once
foolish, disobedient, led astray, serving various lusts and pleasures, living
in evil and envy, being hated and hating one another. 
Titus
3:4  But when the kindness and the love
of Elohim our Saviour toward man appeared, 
Titus
3:5  He saved us, not by works of
righteousness which we have done but according to His compassion, through the
washing of rebirth, and renewal by the Set-apart Spirit, 
Titus
3:6  which He poured out on us richly
through יהושע Messiah our Saviour, 
Titus
3:7  that having been declared right by
His favour we should become heirs according to the expectation of everlasting
life. 
Titus
3:8  Trustworthy is the word, and in this
regard I wish you to strongly affirm, that those who have believed in Elohim
should keep their minds on maintaining good works. This is good and profitable
to men. 
Titus
3:9  But keep away from foolish
questions, and genealogies, and strife and quarrels about the Torah, for they
are unprofitable and useless. 
Titus
3:10  Reject a divisive man after the
first and second warning, 
Titus
3:11  knowing that such a one has been
perverted, and sins, being self-condemned. 
Titus
3:12  When I shall send Artemas to you,
or Tuchikos, do your best to come to me at Nikopolis, for I have decided to
spend the winter there. 
Titus
3:13  Do your best to send Zenas the
lawyer and Apollos on their journey, so that they lack none at all. 
Titus
3:14  And our brothers should also learn to maintain good works, to meet urgent
needs, so that they shall not be without fruit. 
Titus
3:15  All those with me greet you. Greet
those who love us in the belief. Favour be with you all. Amĕn.
