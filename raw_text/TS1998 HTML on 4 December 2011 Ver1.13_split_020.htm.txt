Chronicles
2Chron
1:1  And Shelomoh son of Dawiḏ
strengthened himself over his reign, and יהוה his
Elohim was with him and made him exceedingly great. 
2Chron
1:2  And Shelomoh spoke to all Yisra’ĕl,
to the commanders of the thousands and of the hundreds, to the judges, and to
every leader in all Yisra’ĕl, the heads of the fathers’ houses. 
2Chron
1:3  And Shelomoh, and all the assembly
with him, went to the high place that was at Giḇ‛on, for Elohim’s
Tent of Meeting was there, which Mosheh the servant of יהוה
had made in the wilderness. 
2Chron
1:4  However, Dawiḏ had brought up
the ark of Elohim from Qiryath Ye‛arim to the place Dawiḏ had
prepared for it, for he had pitched a tent for it in Yerushalayim. 
2Chron
1:5  And the bronze altar that Betsal’ĕl
son of Uri son of Ḥur had made, he put before the Dwelling Place of יהוה.
And Shelomoh and the assembly sought it.
2Chron
1:6  And Shelomoh went up there to the
bronze altar before יהוה, which was at the Tent of
Meeting, and offered a thousand burnt offerings on it. 
2Chron
1:7  That night Elohim appeared to
Shelomoh, and said to him, “Ask what should I give you!” 
2Chron
1:8  And Shelomoh said to Elohim, “You
have shown great kindness to Dawiḏ my father, and have made me sovereign
in his place. 
2Chron
1:9  “Now, יהוה
Elohim, let Your promise to Dawiḏ my father stand fast, for You have set
me up to reign over a people as numerous as the dust of the earth. 
2Chron
1:10  “Now give me wisdom and knowledge,
so that I go out and come in before this people. For who is able to rightly rule this great people of Yours?” 
2Chron
1:11  And Elohim said to Shelomoh, “Because
this was in your heart, and you have not asked riches or wealth or esteem or
the life of your enemies, nor have you asked long life, but have asked wisdom
and knowledge for yourself, so as to rightly rule My people over whom I have
set you up to reign, 
2Chron
1:12  wisdom and knowledge are given to
you. And riches and wealth and esteem I also
give you, such as none of the sovereigns have had who have been before you, nor
any after you have.” 
2Chron
1:13  And Shelomoh went to Yerushalayim
from the high place that was at Giḇ‛on, from before the Tent of
Meeting, and reigned over Yisra’ĕl. 
2Chron
1:14  And Shelomoh gathered chariots and
horsemen, and he had one thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand
horsemen, whom he stationed in the chariot cities and with the sovereign in
Yerushalayim. 
2Chron
1:15  And the sovereign made silver and
gold to be as stones in Yerushalayim, and he made cedars to be as plenty as the
sycamores which are in the low country. 
2Chron
1:16  And Shelomoh had horses imported
from Mitsrayim and from Quĕ – the sovereign’s merchants bought them in Quĕ
at a price. 
2Chron
1:17  And they came up and brought from
Mitsrayim a chariot for six hundred pieces of silver, and a horse for one
hundred and fifty. And so, for all the sovereigns of the Ḥittites and the
sovereigns of Aram, they brought them out by their hand. 
2Chron
2:1  And Shelomoh gave word to build a
House for the Name of יהוה, and a house for his reign. 
2Chron
2:2  Then Shelomoh enrolled seventy
thousand men to bear burdens, eighty thousand hewing stone in the mountains, and three thousand six hundred to oversee
them. 
2Chron
2:3  And Shelomoh sent to Ḥuram
sovereign of Tsor, saying, “As you did for my father Dawiḏ, and sent him
cedars to build himself a house to dwell in – 
2Chron
2:4  see, I am building a House for the
Name of יהוה my Elohim, to set it apart to Him, to burn
before Him sweet incense, and for the continual showbread, and for the burnt
offerings morning and evening, on the Sabbaths, and on the New Moons, and on
the appointed times of יהוה our Elohim. This is for
Yisra’ĕl forever. 
2Chron
2:5  “And the House which I build is
great, for our Elohim is greater than all mighty ones. 
2Chron
2:6  “But who is able to build Him a
House, since the heavens and the heavens of the heavens are unable to contain
Him? Who am I then, that I should build Him a House, except to offer before
Him? 
2Chron
2:7  “And now, send me at once a man who
knows to work in gold, and in silver, and in bronze, and in iron, and in purple
and crimson and blue, and knowing to engrave with the skilled men who are with
me in Yehuḏah and Yerushalayim, whom Dawiḏ my father has prepared. 
2Chron
2:8  “And send me cedar, cypress and
algum logs from Leḇanon, for I know that your servants know to cut timber
in Leḇanon. And see, my servants are with your servants, 
2Chron
2:9  even to prepare plenty of timber for
me, for the House that I am building is great and marvellous. 
2Chron
2:10  “And see, I have given servants to
you, the hewers who cut timber, twenty thousand kors of ground wheat, and
twenty thousand kors of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty
thousand baths of oil.” 
2Chron
2:11  Then Ḥuram the sovereign of
Tsor answered in writing, which he sent to Shelomoh, “Because יהוה
loves His people, He has made you sovereign over them.” 
2Chron
2:12  And Ḥuram said, “Blessed be יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, who made the heavens and earth, for He has given
Sovereign Dawiḏ a wise son, knowing wisdom and understanding, to build a
House for יהוה and a house for his reign! 
2Chron
2:13  “And now I have sent a skilled man
having understanding, Ḥuram-aḇi, 
2Chron
2:14  the son of a woman of the daughters
of Dan, and his father was a man of Tsor, who knows to work in gold, and in
silver, in bronze, in iron, in stone, and in wood, purple and blue, and in fine
linen, and in crimson, and to make any engraving and to accomplish any plan
that is given to him, with your skilled men and with the skilled men of my
master Dawiḏ your father. 
2Chron
2:15  “And now, the wheat and the barley,
the oil and the wine which my master has spoken of, let him send to his
servants. 
2Chron
2:16  “And let us cut wood from Leḇanon,
as much as you need, and bring it to you in rafts by sea to Yapho, and you take
it up to Yerushalayim.” 
2Chron
2:17  And Shelomoh numbered all the men,
the strangers who were in the land of Yisra’ĕl, according to the census in
which Dawiḏ his father had numbered them, and they were found to be one
hundred and fifty-three thousand six hundred. 
2Chron
2:18  And he made seventy thousand of
them to bear burdens, and eighty thousand hewers of stone in the mountain, and three thousand six hundred overseers
to make the people work. 
2Chron
3:1  And Shelomoh began to build the
House of יהוה at Yerushalayim on Mount Moriyah, where
He appeared to his father Dawiḏ, at the place that Dawiḏ had
prepared on the threshing-floor of Ornan the Yeḇusite. 
2Chron
3:2  And he began to build on the second
day of the second month in the fourth year of his reign. 
2Chron
3:3  And these are the foundations which
Shelomoh laid for building the House of Elohim: The length by cubits according
to the former measure were sixty cubits, and the width twenty cubits. 
2Chron
3:4  And the porch that was in front was
twenty cubits long according to the breadth of the house, and the height was
one hundred and twenty. And he overlaid the inside with clean gold. 
2Chron
3:5  And the great house he panelled with
cypress which he overlaid with fine gold, and he carved palm trees and
chainwork on it. 
2Chron
3:6  And he covered the house with
precious stones for comeliness, and the gold was gold from Parwayim. 
2Chron
3:7  And he overlaid the house, the
beams, the doorposts, and its walls, and its doors with gold, and carved keruḇim
on the walls. 
2Chron
3:8  And he made the House of the Most
Set-apart. Its length was according to the width of the house, twenty cubits,
and its width twenty cubits. And he overlaid it with fine gold, six hundred
talents. 
2Chron
3:9  And the weight of the nails was
fifty sheqels of gold. And he overlaid the upper rooms with gold. 
2Chron
3:10  In the Most Set-apart House he made
two keruḇim of sculptured work, and overlaid them with gold. 
2Chron
3:11  And the wings of the keruḇim:
their total length was twenty cubits,
one wing was five cubits, touching the wall of the room, and the other wing was
five cubits, touching the wing of the other keruḇ, 
2Chron
3:12  and the wing of the other keruḇ
was five cubits, touching the wall of the room, and the other wing also was
five cubits, touching the wing of the other keruḇ. 
2Chron
3:13  The wings of these keruḇim
spread out twenty cubits, and they stood on their feet, and they faced inward. 
2Chron
3:14  And he made the veil of blue and
purple and crimson and fine linen, and worked keruḇim on it. 
2Chron
3:15  And at the front of the House he
made two columns thirty-five cubits high, and the capital that was on the top
of each of them was five cubits. 
2Chron
3:16  And he made wreaths of chainwork,
as in the Speaking Place, and put them on top of the columns. And he made one
hundred pomegranates, and put them on the wreaths of chainwork. 
2Chron
3:17  And he set up the columns before
the Hĕḵal, one on the right and the other on the left, and called
the name of the one on the right Yaḵin, and the name of the one on the
left Bo‛az. 
2Chron
4:1  And he made an altar of bronze,
twenty cubits long, and twenty cubits wide, and ten cubits high. 
2Chron
4:2  And he made the Sea of cast metal, ten cubits from one rim to the
other, round all about. And its height was five cubits, and a line of thirty
cubits measured around it. 
2Chron
4:3  And figures like oxen were under it,
all around it, ten to a cubit, all the way around the Sea. Two rows of oxen
were cast when it was cast. 
2Chron
4:4  It stood on twelve oxen, three
facing north, and three facing west, and three facing south, and three facing
east. And the Sea was set upon them, and all their back parts were inward. 
2Chron
4:5  And it was a handbreadth thick, and
its rim was shaped like the rim of a cup, like a lily blossom. It held three
thousand baths. 
2Chron
4:6  And he made ten basins, and put five
on the right side and five on the left, to wash in them. In them they rinsed
off what pertains to the burnt offering, but the Sea was for the priests to
wash in. 
2Chron
4:7  And he made ten lampstands of gold
according to their ruling, and set them in the Hĕḵal, five on the
right side and five on the left. 
2Chron
4:8  And he made ten tables, and placed
them in the Hĕḵal, five on the right side and five on the left. And
he made one hundred bowls of gold. 
2Chron
4:9  And he made the courtyard of the
priests, and the great court and doors for the court. And he overlaid these
doors with bronze. 
2Chron
4:10  And he placed the Sea on the right
side, eastward over against the south. 
2Chron
4:11  And Ḥuram made the pots and
the shovels and the bowls. So Ḥuram completed doing the work that he was
to do for Sovereign Shelomoh for the House of Elohim: 
2Chron
4:12  the two columns and the bowl-shaped
capitals that were on top of the two columns, and the two networks to cover the
two bowl-shaped capitals which were on top of the columns; 
2Chron
4:13  and four hundred pomegranates for
the two networks, two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two
bowl-shaped capitals that were on the columns. 
2Chron
4:14  And he made stands and the basins
on the stands, 
2Chron
4:15  one Sea and twelve oxen under it; 
2Chron
4:16  and the pots, and the shovels, and
the forks. And all their vessels Ḥuram his master craftsman made of
polished bronze for Sovereign Shelomoh for the House of יהוה.

2Chron
4:17  On the plain of Yardĕn the
sovereign had them cast in clay moulds, between Sukkoth and Tserĕḏathah.

2Chron
4:18  And Shelomoh made so large a number
of all these vessels that the weight of the bronze was not searched out. 
2Chron
4:19  And Shelomoh had all the
furnishings made for the House of Elohim, and the altar of gold and the tables
on which was the showbread, 
2Chron
4:20  and the lampstands with their lamps
of refined gold, to burn according to right-ruling in front of the Speaking
Place, 
2Chron
4:21  and the blossoms and the lamps and
the snuffers of gold, of perfect gold, 
2Chron
4:22  and the snuffers, and the bowls,
and the ladles, and the fire holders of refined gold. And the entrance to the
House, its inner doors to the Most Set-apart Place, and the doors of the hĕḵal
of the House, were of gold. 
2Chron
5:1  And all the work that Shelomoh had
done for the House of יהוה was completed. And Shelomoh
brought in the set-apart items of his father Dawiḏ: the silver and the
gold and all the utensils. And he put them in the treasuries of the House of
Elohim. 
2Chron
5:2  And Shelomoh assembled the elders of
Yisra’ĕl and all the heads of the tribes, the chief fathers of the
children of Yisra’ĕl, in Yerushalayim, to bring up the ark of the covenant
of יהוה from the City of Dawiḏ, which is Tsiyon. 
2Chron
5:3  And all the men of Yisra’ĕl
assembled to the sovereign at the festival, which was in the seventh month. 
2Chron
5:4  And all the elders of Yisra’ĕl
came, and the Lĕwites took up the ark, 
2Chron
5:5  and they brought up the ark, the
Tent of Meeting, and all the set-apart utensils that were in the Tent. The Lĕwite
priests brought them up. 
2Chron
5:6  And Sovereign Shelomoh, and all the
congregation of Yisra’ĕl who were assembled to him before the ark, were
slaughtering so many sheep and cattle that could not be counted or numbered. 
2Chron
5:7  And the priests brought in the ark
of the covenant of יהוה to its place, into the Speaking
Place of the House, to the Most Set-apart Place, under the wings of the keruḇim.

2Chron
5:8  For the keruḇim spread their
wings over the place of the ark, and the keruḇim covered over the ark and
its poles. 
2Chron
5:9  And the poles were so long that the
ends of the poles of the ark were seen from the set-apart place, in front of
the Speaking Place, but they were not seen from outside. And they are there to
this day. 
2Chron
5:10  There was naught in the ark but the
two tablets which Mosheh put there at Ḥorĕḇ, when יהוה
made a covenant with the children of Yisra’ĕl, when they came out of
Mitsrayim. 
2Chron
5:11  And it came to be when the priests
came out of the Most Set-apart Place – for all the priests who were present had
set themselves apart, there was none to watch by division – 
2Chron
5:12  and the Lĕwite singers, all
those of Asaph and Hĕman and Yeḏuthun, with their sons and their
brothers, stood at the east end of the altar, dressed in white linen, having
cymbals and harps and lyres, and with them one hundred and twenty priests
sounding with trumpets. 
2Chron
5:13  Then it came to be, as the
trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising
and thanking יהוה, and when they lifted up their voice
with the trumpets, and with cymbals, and with instruments of song, and giving
praise to יהוה, “For He is good, for His kindness is
everlasting,” that the house, the House of יהוה, was
filled with a cloud, 
2Chron
5:14  and the priests were unable to stand
and perform the service because of the cloud, for the esteem of יהוה
filled the House of Elohim. 
2Chron
6:1  Then Shelomoh said, “ יהוה
has said He would dwell in the dark cloud. 
2Chron
6:2  “But I have built You an exalted
house, and a place for You to dwell in forever.” 
2Chron
6:3  And the sovereign turned around and
blessed all the assembly of Yisra’ĕl, while all the assembly of Yisra’ĕl
stood. 
2Chron
6:4  And he said, “Blessed be יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, who has filled with His hands what He spoke with His
mouth to my father Dawiḏ, saying, 
2Chron
6:5  ‘From the day that I brought My
people out of the land of Mitsrayim, I have chosen no city from any tribe of
Yisra’ĕl in which to build a house for My Name to be there, nor did I
choose any man to be a leader over My people Yisra’ĕl. 
2Chron
6:6  ‘But I have chosen Yerushalayim, for
My Name to be there. And I have chosen Dawiḏ to be over My people Yisra’ĕl.’

2Chron
6:7  “And it was in the heart of my
father Dawiḏ to build a House for the Name of יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl. 
2Chron
6:8  “But יהוה
said to my father Dawiḏ, ‘Because it was in your heart to build a House
for My Name, you did well in that it was in your heart. 
2Chron
6:9  ‘But you do not build the house, for
your son who comes forth from your loins, he does build the House for My Name.’

2Chron
6:10  “Now יהוה
has established His word which He spoke, and I have been raised up instead of
my father Dawiḏ, and sit on the throne of Yisra’ĕl, as יהוה
promised. And I have built the House for the Name of יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl. 
2Chron
6:11  “And there I have placed the ark,
in which is the covenant of יהוה which He made with the
children of Yisra’ĕl.” 
2Chron
6:12  And he stood before the altar of יהוה
in front of all the assembly of Yisra’ĕl, and spread out his hands – 
2Chron
6:13  for Shelomoh had made a bronze
platform five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and
had put it in the midst of the court. And he stood on it, and knelt down on his
knees before all the assembly of Yisra’ĕl, and spread out his hands toward
the heavens – 
2Chron
6:14  and said, “ יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, there is no Elohim in the heavens or on earth like
You, guarding the covenant and kindness with Your servants who walk before You
with all their heart, 
2Chron
6:15  who has guarded what You promised
Your servant Dawiḏ my father. Indeed, You have both spoken with Your
mouth and have filled it with Your hand, as it is this day. 
2Chron
6:16  “And now, יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, guard what You promised Your servant Dawiḏ my
father, saying, ‘There is not to cease a man of yours before Me, sitting on the
throne of Yisra’ĕl – only, if your sons guard their way, to walk in My
Torah as you have walked before Me.’ 
2Chron
6:17  “And now, O יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, let Your word come true which You have spoken to Your
servant Dawiḏ. 
2Chron
6:18  “For is it true: Elohim dwells with
men on the earth! See, the heavens and the heavens of the heavens are unable to
contain You, how much less this House which I have built! 
2Chron
6:19  “Yet, shall You turn to the prayer
of Your servant and his supplication, O יהוה my Elohim,
to listen to the cry and to the prayer which Your servant is praying before
You? 
2Chron
6:20  “For Your eyes to be open toward
this House day and night, toward the place You have said to put Your Name
there, to listen to the prayer which Your servant prays toward this place. 
2Chron
6:21  “And shall You give heed to the
supplications of Your servant and of Your people Yisra’ĕl, when they pray
toward this place, and hear from Your dwelling place, in the heavens, and shall
hear and forgive? 
2Chron
6:22  “If anyone sins against his
neighbour, and he has lifted up an oath on him, to cause him to swear, and
comes and swears before Your altar in this House, 
2Chron
6:23  then hear in the heavens, and act,
and rightly rule Your servants, repaying the wrong by bringing his way on his
own head, and declare right the righteous by giving him according to his
righteousness. 
2Chron
6:24  “And if Your people Yisra’ĕl
are smitten before an enemy because they have sinned against You, and they
shall turn back and confess Your Name, and pray and make supplication before
You in this House, 
2Chron
6:25  then hear in the heavens and
forgive the sin of Your people Yisra’ĕl, and bring them back to the land
which You gave to them and their fathers. 
2Chron
6:26  “When the heavens are shut up and
there is no rain because they have sinned against You, and they shall pray
toward this place and confess Your Name, and turn from their sin because You
afflict them, 
2Chron
6:27  then hear in the heavens, and
forgive the sin of Your servants, Your people Yisra’ĕl – for You teach
them the good way in which they should walk – and shall send rain on Your land
which You have given to Your people as an inheritance. 
2Chron
6:28  “When there is scarcity of food in
the land; when there is pestilence or blight or mildew, locusts or
grasshoppers; when their enemies distress them in the land of their cities; any
plague or any sickness; 
2Chron
6:29  whatever prayer, whatever
supplication is made by anyone, or by all Your people Yisra’ĕl, when each
one knows his own plague and his own grief, and spreads out his hands to this
house, 
2Chron
6:30  then hear from the heavens Your
dwelling place, and forgive, and give to everyone according to all his ways,
whose heart You know – for You alone know the hearts of the sons of men – 
2Chron
6:31  so that they fear You, to walk in
Your ways as long as they live in the land which You gave to our fathers. 
2Chron
6:32  “Also, concerning a foreigner, who
is not of Your people Yisra’ĕl, but who comes from a far land for the sake
of Your great Name and Your strong hand and Your outstretched arm, when they
come and pray in this House, 
2Chron
6:33  then hear from the heavens Your
dwelling place, and do according to all which the foreigner calls to You for,
so that all the people of the earth know Your Name and fear You, as do Your
people Yisra’ĕl, and to know that this House which I have built is called
by Your Name. 
2Chron
6:34  “When Your people go out to battle
against their enemies, in the way that You send them, and they shall pray to
You toward this city which You have chosen and toward the House which I have
built for Your Name, 
2Chron
6:35  then shall You hear from the
heavens their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause? 
2Chron
6:36  “When they sin against You – for
there is no one who does not sin – and You become enraged with them and give
them to the enemy, and they take them captive to a land far or near, 
2Chron
6:37  and they shall turn back unto their
heart, in the land where they have been taken captive, and shall turn, and make
supplication to You in the land of their captivity, saying, ‘We have sinned, we
have acted crookedly, and have done wrong,’ 
2Chron
6:38  and when they return to You with
all their heart and with all their being in the land of their captivity, where
they have taken them captive, and they shall pray toward their land which You
gave to their fathers, and the city which You have chosen, and toward the House
which I have built for Your Name, 
2Chron
6:39  then shall You hear from the
heavens, Your dwelling place, their prayer and their supplications, and
maintain their cause, and forgive Your people who have sinned against You? 
2Chron
6:40  “Now, my Elohim, I pray, let Your
eyes be open and let Your ears be attentive to the prayer of this place. 
2Chron
6:41  “And now, arise, O יהוה
Elohim, to Your resting place, You and the ark of Your strength. Let Your
priests, O יהוה Elohim, be robed with deliverance, and
let Your kind ones rejoice in goodness. 
2Chron
6:42  “O יהוה
Elohim, do not turn away the face of Your anointed; remember the kind acts of
Your servant Dawiḏ.” 
2Chron
7:1  And when Shelomoh had ended praying,
fire came down from the heavens and consumed the burnt offering and the
slaughterings. And the esteem of יהוה filled the House.

2Chron
7:2  And the priests were unable to enter
the House of יהוה, because the esteem of יהוה
had filled the House of יהוה. 
2Chron
7:3  And all the children of Yisra’ĕl
saw how the fire came down, and the esteem of יהוה on
the House, and they bowed their faces to the ground on the pavement, and did
obeisance and gave thanks to יהוה, saying, “For He is
good, for His kindness is everlasting.” 
2Chron
7:4  And the sovereign and all the people
were making offerings before יהוה. 
2Chron
7:5  And Sovereign Shelomoh made an
offering of twenty-two thousand bulls and one hundred and twenty thousand
sheep. Thus the sovereign and all the people dedicated the House of Elohim.
2Chron
7:6  And the priests were standing over
their duties, and the Lĕwites with instruments of the song to יהוה,
which Sovereign Dawiḏ had made to give thanks to יהוה,
saying, “For His kindness is everlasting,” whenever Dawiḏ praised by
their hand. And the priests were blowing trumpets before them, and all Yisra’ĕl
were standing. 
2Chron
7:7  And Shelomoh set apart the middle of
the courtyard that was in front of the House of יהוה,
for there he made burnt offerings and the fat of the peace offerings, because
the bronze altar which Shelomoh had made was not able to contain the burnt
offerings and the grain offerings and the fat. 
2Chron
7:8  And Shelomoh at that time observed
the Festival seven days, and all Yisra’ĕl with him, a very great assembly
from the entrance of Ḥamath to the wadi of Mitsrayim. 
2Chron
7:9  And on the eighth day they held an
assembly, for they performed the dedication of the altar seven days, and the
festival seven days. 
2Chron
7:10  And on the twenty-third day of the
seventh month he sent the people away to their tents, rejoicing and glad of
heart for the goodness that יהוה had done for Dawiḏ,
and for Shelomoh, and for His people Yisra’ĕl.
2Chron
7:11  Thus Shelomoh finished the House of
יהוה and the sovereign’s house. And all that came into
the heart of Shelomoh to do in the House of יהוה and in
his own house, he prosperously executed. 
2Chron
7:12  And יהוה
appeared to Shelomoh by night, and said to him, “I have heard your prayer, and
have chosen this place for Myself as a house of slaughtering.
2Chron
7:13  “If I shut up the heavens and there
is no rain, or if I command the locusts to devour the land, or if I send
pestilence among My people, 
2Chron
7:14  and My people upon whom My Name is
called, shall humble themselves, and pray and seek My face, and turn from their
evil ways, then I shall hear from the heavens, and forgive their sin and heal
their land. 
2Chron
7:15  “Now, My eyes are open and My ears
attentive to the prayer of this place. 
2Chron
7:16  “And now, I have chosen and set
this house apart for My Name to be there forever. And My eyes and My heart
shall always be there. 
2Chron
7:17  “And you, if you walk before Me as
your father Dawiḏ walked, and do according to all that I have commanded
you, and if you guard My laws and My right-rulings,
2Chron
7:18  then I shall establish the throne
of your reign, as I covenanted with Dawiḏ your father, saying, ‘There is
not to cease a man of yours as ruler in Yisra’ĕl.’
2Chron
7:19  “But if you turn away and forsake
My laws and My commands which I have set before you, and shall go and serve
other mighty ones, and bow yourself to them, 
2Chron
7:20  then I shall pluck them from My
land, which I have given them, and this house which I have set apart for My
Name I shall cast out of My sight and make it to be a proverb and a mockery
among all peoples. 
2Chron
7:21  “And this house, which has been
exalted, everyone who passes by it is shall be astonished and say, ‘Why has יהוה
done thus to this land and this house?’ 
2Chron
7:22  “Then they shall say, ‘Because they
forsook יהוה Elohim of their fathers, who brought them
out of the land of Mitsrayim, and embraced other mighty ones, and bowed
themselves to them and served them, therefore He has brought all this evil on
them.’ ” 
2Chron
8:1  And it came to be at the end of
twenty years, that Shelomoh had built the House of יהוה,
and his own house. 
2Chron
8:2  As to the cities which Ḥuram
had given to Shelomoh, Shelomoh had built them, and he settled the children of
Yisra’ĕl there. 
2Chron
8:3  And Shelomoh went to Ḥamath
Tsoḇah and seized it. 
2Chron
8:4  And he built Taḏmor in the
wilderness, and all the storage cities which he built in Ḥamath. 
2Chron
8:5  And he built Upper Bĕyth Ḥoron
and Lower Bĕyth Ḥoron, cities of defence, with walls, gates, and
bars, 
2Chron
8:6  also Ba‛alath and all the
storage cities that Shelomoh had, and all the chariot cities and the cities of
the cavalry, and all that Shelomoh desired to build in Yerushalayim, and in Leḇanon,
and in all the land of his rule. 
2Chron
8:7  All the people who were left of the Ḥittites,
and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Ḥiwwites, and the Yeḇusites,
who were not of Yisra’ĕl – 
2Chron
8:8  their descendants who were left in
the land after them, whom the children of Yisra’ĕl did not destroy – from
these Shelomoh raised compulsory labour, as it is to this day. 
2Chron
8:9  And Shelomoh did not make slaves of
the children of Yisra’ĕl for his work, but they were men of battle, and
chiefs of his officers, and commanders of his chariots, and his cavalry. 
2Chron
8:10  And these were the chiefs of the
officials of Sovereign Shelomoh: two hundred and fifty, who ruled over the
people. 
2Chron
8:11  And Shelomoh brought the daughter
of Pharaoh up from the City of Dawiḏ to the house he had built for her,
for he said, “My wife does not dwell in the house of Dawiḏ sovereign of
Yisra’ĕl, for the place where
the ark of יהוה has come, is set-apart.” 
2Chron
8:12  Then Shelomoh offered burnt
offerings to יהוה on the altar of יהוה
which he had built before the porch, 
2Chron
8:13  even as the duty of every day
required, offering according to the command of Mosheh, for the Sabbaths, and
for the New Moons, and for the appointed times three times a year: the Festival
of Unleavened Bread, and the Festival of Weeks, and the Festival of Booths. 
2Chron
8:14  And according to the ruling of Dawiḏ
his father, he appointed the divisions of the priests for their service, the Lĕwites
for their duties, to praise and serve before the priests, as the duty of each
day required, and the gatekeepers by their divisions at each gate, for so was
the command of Dawiḏ the man of Elohim. 
2Chron
8:15  And they did not turn aside from
the command of the sovereign to the priests and Lĕwites concerning any
matter or concerning the treasuries. 
2Chron
8:16  And all the work of Shelomoh was
prepared from the day of the foundation of the House of יהוה
until it was completed. And the House of יהוה was perfected.

2Chron
8:17  Then Shelomoh went to Etsyon Geḇer
and Ĕyloth on the seacoast, in the land of Eḏom. 
2Chron
8:18  And Ḥuram sent him ships by
the hand of his servants, and servants who knew the sea. And they went with the
servants of Shelomoh to Ophir, and took four hundred and fifty talents of gold
from there, and brought it to Sovereign Shelomoh. 
2Chron
9:1  And the sovereigness of Sheḇa
heard of the report of Shelomoh, and came to Yerushalayim to try Shelomoh with
hard questions, with a very great company, and camels bearing spices, and much
gold, and precious stones. And she came to Shelomoh, and she spoke with him
about all that was in her heart.
2Chron
9:2  And Shelomoh answered all her questions.
And there was no matter hidden for Shelomoh which he did not make known to her.

2Chron
9:3  And the sovereigness of Sheḇa
saw the wisdom of Shelomoh, and the house that he had built, 
2Chron
9:4  and the food on his table, and the
seating of his servants, and the service of his waiters and their attire, and
his cupbearers and their attire, and his burnt offerings that he offered up in
the House of יהוה, and there was no more spirit in her.

2Chron
9:5  Then she said to the sovereign, “True
was the word I heard in my own land about your words and your wisdom. 
2Chron
9:6  “But I did not believe their words
until I came and saw with my own eyes. And see, I have not been told the half
of the greatness of your wisdom! You exceed the report which I heard. 
2Chron
9:7  “Blessed are your men and blessed
are these your servants, who stand continually before you and hear your wisdom!

2Chron
9:8  “Blessed be יהוה
your Elohim, who delighted in you, to put you on His throne to be sovereign for
יהוה your Elohim! Because your Elohim has loved Yisra’ĕl,
to establish them forever, therefore He made you sovereign over them, to do
right-ruling and righteousness.” 
2Chron
9:9  And she gave the sovereign one
hundred and twenty talents of gold, and very many spices, and precious stones.
And there has not been any spices such as those the sovereigness of Sheḇa
gave to Sovereign Shelomoh. 
2Chron
9:10  And also, the servants of Ḥuram
and the servants of Shelomoh, who brought gold from Ophir, brought algum wood
and precious stones. 
2Chron
9:11  And the sovereign made stairs of
the algum wood for the House of יהוה and for the
sovereign’s house, also lyres and harps for singers. And there was never seen
the like of them before in the land of Yehuḏah. 
2Chron
9:12  And Sovereign Shelomoh gave to the
sovereigness of Sheḇa all she desired, whatever she asked, besides that
which she had brought to the sovereign. And she turned and went to her own
land, she and her servants. 
2Chron
9:13  And the weight of gold that came to
Shelomoh yearly was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold, 
2Chron
9:14  besides that which the merchants
and traders brought. And all the sovereigns of Araḇia and governors of
the land were bringing gold and silver to Shelomoh. 
2Chron
9:15  And Sovereign Shelomoh made two
hundred large shields of beaten gold – six hundred pieces of beaten gold went
into each shield, 
2Chron
9:16  and three hundred shields of beaten
gold – three hundred pieces of gold went into each shield. And the sovereign
put them in the House of the Forest of Leḇanon. 
2Chron
9:17  And the sovereign made a great
throne of ivory, and overlaid it with clean gold, 
2Chron
9:18  and six steps led to the throne, with a footstool of gold, which were fastened to
the throne; and there were armrests on either side of the place of the seat,
and two lions stood beside the armrests. 
2Chron
9:19  And twelve lions were standing
there, one on each side of the six steps. The like of it was not in any reign. 
2Chron
9:20  And all the drinking vessels of Sovereign
Shelomoh were of gold, and all the vessels of the House of the Forest of Leḇanon
were of refined gold – silver was reckoned of little value in the days of
Shelomoh. 
2Chron
9:21  For the sovereign’s ships went to
Tarshish with the servants of Ḥuram. Once in three years the ships of
Tarshish came, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, apes, and baboons. 
2Chron
9:22  And Sovereign Shelomoh became
greater than all the sovereigns of the earth in riches and wisdom. 
2Chron
9:23  And all the sovereigns of the earth
sought the presence of Shelomoh to hear his wisdom, which Elohim had put in his
heart. 
2Chron
9:24  And each man brought his present:
objects of silver, and objects of gold, and garments, and armour, and spices,
horses and mules, the matter of a year by year. 
2Chron
9:25  And Shelomoh had four thousand
stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen whom he stationed
in the chariot cities and with the sovereign at Yerushalayim. 
2Chron
9:26  And he ruled over all the
sovereigns from the River to the land of the Philistines, as far as the border
of Mitsrayim. 
2Chron
9:27  And the sovereign made silver in
Yerushalayim as the stones, and he made cedar trees as plenty as the sycamores
which are in the low country. 
2Chron
9:28  And they were bringing horses to
Shelomoh from Mitsrayim and from all lands. 
2Chron
9:29  And the rest of the acts of
Shelomoh, first and last, are they not written in the book of Nathan the
prophet, and in the prophecy of Aḥiyah the Shilonite, and in the visions
of Iddo the seer concerning Yaroḇ‛am son of Neḇat? 
2Chron
9:30  And Shelomoh reigned in
Yerushalayim over all Yisra’ĕl forty years. 
2Chron
9:31  So Shelomoh slept with his fathers,
and was buried in the City of Dawiḏ his father. And Reḥaḇ‛am
his son reigned in his place. 
2Chron
10:1  And Reḥaḇ‛am went
to Sheḵem, for all Yisra’ĕl had gone to Sheḵem to set him up
to reign. 
2Chron
10:2  And it came to be, when Yaroḇ‛am
son of Neḇat heard it – he was in Mitsrayim where he had fled from the presence
of Shelomoh the sovereign – that Yaroḇ‛am returned from Mitsrayim. 
2Chron
10:3  So they sent for him and called
him. And Yaroḇ‛am and all Yisra’ĕl came and spoke to
Reḥaḇ‛am, saying, 
2Chron
10:4  “Your father made our yoke hard,
and now, lighten the hard service of your father and his heavy yoke which he
put on us, then we shall serve you.” 
2Chron
10:5  And he said to them, “Come back to
me after three days.” And the people went. 
2Chron
10:6  Then Sovereign Reḥaḇ‛am
consulted the elders who stood before his father Shelomoh while he still lived,
saying, “What do you advise me to answer these people?” 
2Chron
10:7  And they spoke to him, saying, “If
you are good to these people, and shall please them, and speak good words to
them, they shall be your servants all the days.” 
2Chron
10:8  But he ignored the advice the
elders gave him, and consulted the young men who had grown up with him, who
stood before him. 
2Chron
10:9  And he said to them, “What advice
do you give? How should we answer this people who have spoken to me, saying, ‘Lighten
the yoke which your father put on us’?”
2Chron
10:10  And the young men who had grown up
with him spoke to him, saying, “Say this to the people who have spoken to you,
saying, ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, but you make it lighter on us.’ Say
this to them, ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s waist! 
2Chron
10:11  ‘And now, my father put a heavy
yoke on you, but I, I add to your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, but
I with scourges!’ ” 
2Chron
10:12  So Yaroḇ‛am and all
the people came to Reḥaḇ‛am on the third day, as the
sovereign commanded, saying, “Come back to me the third day.” 
2Chron
10:13  And the sovereign answered them
harshly. Thus Sovereign Reḥaḇ‛am ignored the advice of the
elders, 
2Chron
10:14  and spoke to them according to the
advice of the young men, saying, “My father made your yoke heavy, but I, I add
to it; my father chastised you with whips, but I with scourges!” 
2Chron
10:15  So the sovereign did not listen to
the people, for the turn of events
was from Elohim, in order for יהוה to establish His
word, which He had spoken by the hand of Aḥiyahu the Shilonite to Yaroḇ‛am
son of Neḇat. 
2Chron
10:16  And when all Yisra’ĕl saw
that the sovereign did not listen to them, the people answered the sovereign,
saying, “What portion have we in Dawiḏ? And we have no inheritance in the
son of Yishai. Every man to your mighty ones, O Yisra’ĕl! Now see to your
own house, O Dawiḏ!” So all Yisra’ĕl went to their tents. 
2Chron
10:17  But as for the children of Yisra’ĕl
who dwelt in the cities of Yehuḏah, Reḥaḇ‛am reigned
over them. 
2Chron
10:18  Then Sovereign Reḥaḇ‛am
sent Haḏoram, who was over the compulsory labour, and the children of
Yisra’ĕl stoned him with stones, and he died. And Sovereign Reḥaḇ‛am
hastily mounted his chariot to flee to Yerushalayim. 
2Chron
10:19  Thus Yisra’ĕl revolted
against the house of Dawiḏ to this day. 
2Chron
11:1  And when Reḥaḇ‛am
came to Yerushalayim, he assembled from the house of Yehuḏah and Binyamin
one hundred and eighty thousand chosen brave men to fight against Yisra’ĕl,
to bring back the reign to Reḥaḇ‛am. 
2Chron
11:2  But the word of יהוה
came to Shemayahu the man of Elohim, saying, 
2Chron
11:3  “Speak to Reḥaḇ‛am
son of Shelomoh, sovereign of Yehuḏah, and to all Yisra’ĕl in Yehuḏah
and Binyamin, saying, 
2Chron
11:4  ‘Thus said יהוה,
“Do not go up or fight against your brothers! Let every man return to his
house, for this matter is from Me.” ’ ” So they obeyed the words of יהוה,
and turned back from going against Yaroḇ‛am. 
2Chron
11:5  And Reḥaḇ‛am
dwelt in Yerushalayim, and built cities for a defence in Yehuḏah. 
2Chron
11:6  And he built Bĕyth
Leḥem, and Ĕytam, and Teqowa, 
2Chron
11:7  and Bĕyth Tsur, and Soḵo,
and Aḏullam, 
2Chron
11:8  and Gath, and Marĕshah, and
Ziph, 
2Chron
11:9  and Aḏorayim, and Laḵish,
and Azĕqah, 
2Chron
11:10  and Tsor‛ah, and Ayalon, and
Ḥeḇron, which are in Yehuḏah and Binyamin, cities of defence.

2Chron
11:11  And he strengthened the
strongholds, and put commanders in them, and stores of food, and oil, and wine,

2Chron
11:12  and shields and spears in every
city, and made them very strong. Thus Yehuḏah and Binyamin were his. 
2Chron
11:13  And from all their borders the
priests and the Lĕwites who were in all Yisra’ĕl took their stand
with him. 
2Chron
11:14  For the Lĕwites left their
open lands and their possessions and came to Yehuḏah and Yerushalayim,
for Yaroḇ‛am and his sons had rejected them from serving as priests
unto יהוה, 
2Chron
11:15  as he appointed for himself
priests for the high places, and for goats, and the calf idols which he had
made. 
2Chron
11:16  And after the Lĕwites left,
those from all the tribes of Yisra’ĕl, such as set their heart to seek יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, came to Yerushalayim to offer to יהוה
Elohim of their fathers. 
2Chron
11:17  And they strengthened the reign of
Yehuḏah, and made Reḥaḇ‛am son of Shelomoh strong for
three years, for they walked in the way of Dawiḏ and Shelomoh for three
years. 
2Chron
11:18  And Reḥaḇ‛am
took for himself as wife Maḥalath the daughter of Yerimoth son of Dawiḏ,
and of Aḇiḥayil the daughter of Eliyaḇ son of Yishai. 
2Chron
11:19  And she bore him sons: Ye‛ush,
and Shemaryah, and Zaham. 
2Chron
11:20  And after her he took Ma‛aḵah
the granddaughter of Aḇshalom. And she bore him Aḇiyah, and Attai,
and Ziza, and Shelomith. 
2Chron
11:21  And Reḥaḇ‛am
loved Ma‛aḵah the granddaughter of Aḇshalom more than all his
wives and his concubines. For he had taken eighteen wives and sixty concubines,
and brought forth twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters. 
2Chron
11:22  And Reḥaḇ‛am
appointed Aḇiyah son of Ma‛aḵah as chief, to be leader among
his brothers, in order to make him reign. 
2Chron
11:23  And he had understanding, and
dispersed some of his sons throughout all the lands of Yehuḏah and
Binyamin, to all the cities of defence, and gave them ample provision. And he
sought many wives for them. 
2Chron
12:1  And it came to be, when Reḥaḇ‛am
had established the reign and had strengthened himself, that he forsook the
Torah of יהוה, and all Yisra’ĕl with him. 
2Chron
12:2  And it came to be, in the fifth
year of Sovereign Reḥaḇ‛am, that Shishaq sovereign of
Mitsrayim came up against Yerushalayim – because they had trespassed against יהוה
–
2Chron
12:3  with twelve hundred chariots, and
sixty thousand horsemen, and innumerable people who came with him out of
Mitsrayim: the Luḇim, the Sukkites and the Kushites. 
2Chron
12:4  And he took the cities of defence
of Yehuḏah and came to Yerushalayim. 
2Chron
12:5  And Shemayah the prophet came to
Reḥaḇ‛am and the rulers of Yehuḏah, who had been
gathered in Yerushalayim because of Shishaq, and said to them, “Thus said יהוה,
‘You have forsaken Me, and therefore I also have left you in the hand of Shishaq.’
” 
2Chron
12:6  Then the rulers of Yisra’ĕl
and the sovereign humbled themselves, and they said, “ יהוה
is righteous.” 
2Chron
12:7  And when יהוה
saw that they humbled themselves, the word of יהוה came
to Shemayah, saying, “They have humbled themselves. I do not destroy them, but
I shall give to them some deliverance, and not pour out My wrath on
Yerushalayim by the hand of Shishaq, 
2Chron
12:8  but they are to become his
servants, so that they know My service and the service of the reigns of the lands.”

2Chron
12:9  And Shishaq sovereign of Mitsrayim
came up against Yerushalayim, and took away the treasures of the House of יהוה
and the treasures of the sovereign’s house. He took all, he also took the gold
shields which Shelomoh had made. 
2Chron
12:10  And Sovereign Reḥaḇ‛am
made bronze shields to replace them and committed them into the hands of the
chiefs of the guard, who guarded the entrance of the sovereign’s house. 
2Chron
12:11  And it came to be, whenever the
sovereign went into the House of יהוה, the guard would
go and bring them out, then they would take them back into the guardroom. 
2Chron
12:12  And when he humbled himself, the
wrath of יהוה turned from him, so as not to destroy him
completely. And matters also went well in Yehuḏah. 
2Chron
12:13  So Sovereign Reḥaḇ‛am
strengthened himself in Yerushalayim and reigned. For Reḥaḇ‛am
was forty-one years old when he became sovereign, and he reigned seventeen
years in Yerushalayim, the city which יהוה had chosen
out of all the tribes of Yisra’ĕl, to put His Name there. And his mother’s
name was Na‛amah, the Ammonitess.
2Chron
12:14  And he did evil, because he did
not prepare his heart to seek יהוה. 
2Chron
12:15  And the acts of Reḥaḇ‛am,
the first and the last, are they not written in the book of Shemayah the
prophet, and of Iddo the seer concerning genealogies? And there was fighting
between Reḥaḇ‛am and Yaroḇ‛am all the days. 
2Chron
12:16  So Reḥaḇ‛am
slept with his fathers, and was buried in the City of Dawiḏ. And Aḇiyah
his son reigned in his place. 
2Chron
13:1  In the eighteenth year of Sovereign
Yaroḇ‛am, Aḇiyah began to reign over Yehuḏah. 
2Chron
13:2  He reigned three years in
Yerushalayim. And his mother’s name was Miḵayahu the daughter of Uri’ĕl
of Giḇ‛ah. And there was fighting between Aḇiyah and Yaroḇ‛am.

2Chron
13:3  And Aḇiyah joined battle with
an army of mighty men of battle, four hundred thousand choice men. And Yaroḇ‛am
drew up in battle formation against him with eight hundred thousand choice men,
mighty brave men. 
2Chron
13:4  And Aḇiyah stood on Mount
Tsemarayim, which is in the mountains of Ephrayim, and said, “Hear me, Yaroḇ‛am
and all Yisra’ĕl: 
2Chron
13:5  “Do you not know that יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl has given the reign over Yisra’ĕl to Dawiḏ
forever, to him and his sons, by a covenant of salt? 
2Chron
13:6  “Yet Yaroḇ‛am son of Neḇat,
the servant of Shelomoh son of Dawiḏ, rose up and rebelled against his
master. 
2Chron
13:7  “And vain men gathered to him, sons
of Beliya‛al, and strengthened themselves against Reḥaḇ‛am
son of Shelomoh, when Reḥaḇ‛am was young and tender of heart
and could not stand against them. 
2Chron
13:8  “And now you think to stand against
the reign of יהוה, which is in the hand of the sons of
Dawiḏ. And you are a large crowd, and with you are the gold calves which
Yaroḇ‛am made for you as mighty ones. 
2Chron
13:9  “Have you not thrown out the
priests of יהוה, the sons of Aharon, and the Lĕwites,
and made for yourselves priests, like the peoples of the lands, so that whoever
comes to ordain himself with a young bull and seven rams then becomes a priest
of what are not mighty ones? 
2Chron
13:10  “But as for us, יהוה
is our Elohim, and we have not forsaken Him, and priests are serving יהוה,
the sons of Aharon and the Lĕwites, in the work, 
2Chron
13:11  and are burning to יהוה
every morning and every evening burnt offerings and sweet incense, and the
showbread is set on the clean table,
and the lampstand of gold with its lamps to burn every evening, for we are
guarding the Charge of יהוה our Elohim. But you have
forsaken Him. 
2Chron
13:12  “And see, with us as Head is
Elohim Himself, and His priests with sounding trumpets to sound the alarm
against you. O children of Yisra’ĕl, do not fight against יהוה
Elohim of your fathers, for you are not going to prosper!” 
2Chron
13:13  But Yaroḇ‛am sent
round an ambush to go behind them, so they were in front of Yehuḏah, and
the ambush was behind them. 
2Chron
13:14  And Yehuḏah turned and saw
the battle was both in front and behind them. Then they cried out to יהוה,
and the priests sounded the trumpets. 
2Chron
13:15  And the men of Yehuḏah gave
a shout. And it came to be, as the men of Yehuḏah shouted, that Elohim
smote Yaroḇ‛am and all Yisra’ĕl before Aḇiyah and Yehuḏah.

2Chron
13:16  And the children of Yisra’ĕl
fled before Yehuḏah, and Elohim gave them into their hand. 
2Chron
13:17  And Aḇiyah and his people
smote them with a great slaughter, and five hundred thousand choice men of
Yisra’ĕl fell slain. 
2Chron
13:18  And the children of Yisra’ĕl
were humbled at that time, while the children of Yehuḏah prevailed,
because they relied on יהוה Elohim of their fathers. 
2Chron
13:19  And Aḇiyah pursued Yaroḇ‛am
and captured cities from him: Bĕyth Ĕl with its villages, and Yeshanah
with its villages, and Ephron with its villages. 
2Chron
13:20  And Yaroḇ‛am did not
regain power again in the days of Aḇiyahu. And יהוה
smote him, and he died. 
2Chron
13:21  But Aḇiyah grew strong, and
took fourteen wives, and brought forth twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters. 
2Chron
13:22  And the rest of the acts of Aḇiyah,
and his ways, and his words are written in the commentary of the prophet Iddo. 
2Chron
14:1  So Aḇiyah slept with his
fathers, and they buried him in the City of Dawiḏ. And Asa his son
reigned in his place. In his days the land rested ten years. 
2Chron
14:2  And Asa did what was good and what
was right in the eyes of יהוה his Elohim, 
2Chron
14:3  and removed the altars of the
stranger, and the high places, and broke down the pillars and cut down the Ashĕrim,

2Chron
14:4  and commanded Yehuḏah to seek
יהוה Elohim of their fathers, and to do the Torah and
the command. 
2Chron
14:5  And he removed the high places and
the sun-pillars from all the cities of Yehuḏah, and the reign rested
under him. 
2Chron
14:6  And he built cities of defence in
Yehuḏah, since the land had rest and he had no fighting in those years,
because יהוה had given him rest. 
2Chron
14:7  And he said to Yehuḏah, “Let
us build these cities and make walls around them, and towers, gates, and bars,
while the land is yet before us, because we have sought יהוה
our Elohim. We have sought, and He has given us rest all around.” So they built
and prospered. 
2Chron
14:8  And Asa had an army of three hundred
thousand men from Yehuḏah bearing shields and spears, and from Binyamin
two hundred and eighty thousand men bearing shields and drew bows. All of them
were mighty brave men. 
2Chron
14:9  And Zeraḥ the Kushite came
out against them with an army of a million men and three hundred chariots, and
he came to Marĕshah. 
2Chron
14:10  And Asa went out against him, and
they set battle in array in the Valley of Tsephathah at Marĕshah. 
2Chron
14:11  And Asa called to יהוה
his Elohim, and said, “ יהוה, there is no one but You
to help between the mighty and the powerless. Help us, O יהוה
our Elohim, for we rest on You, and in Your Name we go against this crowd. O יהוה,
You are our Elohim, do not let man prevail against You!” 
2Chron
14:12  So יהוה
smote the Kushites before Asa and Yehuḏah, and the Kushites fled. 
2Chron
14:13  And Asa and the people who were
with him pursued them to Gerar. And the Kushites fell, until none was left
alive for them, for they were broken before יהוה and
His army. And they took very much spoil, 
2Chron
14:14  and smote all the cities around
Gerar, for the fear of יהוה came upon them. And they
plundered all the cities, for there was exceedingly much spoil in them. 
2Chron
14:15  And they also smote the camps of
the herdsmen, and captured many sheep and camels, and returned to Yerushalayim.

2Chron
15:1  And the Spirit of Elohim came upon
Azaryahu son of Oḏĕḏ. 
2Chron
15:2  And he went out to face Asa, and
said to him, “Hear me, Asa, and all Yehuḏah and Binyamin. יהוה
is with you while you are with Him. And if you seek Him, He is found by you,
but if you forsake Him, He forsakes you. 
2Chron
15:3  “And for many days Yisra’ĕl
has been without the true Elohim, and without a Torah priest, and without
Torah. 
2Chron
15:4  “But in their distress they turned
to יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, and they sought Him,
and He was found by them. 
2Chron
15:5  “And in those days there was no
peace to the one who went out, nor to the one who came in, for great
disturbances were on all the inhabitants of the lands, 
2Chron
15:6  and they were beaten down, nation
by nation, and city by city, for Elohim troubled them with every distress.
2Chron
15:7  “But you, be strong and do not let
your hands be feeble, for there is a reward for your work!” 
2Chron
15:8  And when Asa heard these words and
the prophecy of Oḏĕḏ the prophet, he took courage, and removed
the abominations from all the land of Yehuḏah and Binyamin and from the
cities which he had taken in the mountains of Ephrayim, and restored the altar
of יהוה that was before the porch of יהוה,

2Chron
15:9  and gathered all Yehuḏah and
Binyamin, and those who sojourned with them from Ephrayim, and Menashsheh, and
Shim‛on, for they came over to him in great numbers from Yisra’ĕl
when they saw that יהוה his Elohim was with him. 
2Chron
15:10  And they gathered together at
Yerushalayim in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa, 
2Chron
15:11  and offered to יהוה
on that day seven hundred bulls and seven thousand sheep from the spoil which
they had brought. 
2Chron
15:12  And they entered into a covenant
to seek יהוה Elohim of their fathers with all their
heart and with all their being; 
2Chron
15:13  and whoever would not seek יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl would be put to death, from small to great, from man to
woman. 
2Chron
15:14  And they swore to יהוה
with a loud voice, with shouting and with trumpets and with rams’ horns. 
2Chron
15:15  And all Yehuḏah rejoiced
concerning the oath, for they had sworn with all their heart and sought Him
with all their being. And He was found by them, and יהוה
gave them rest all around. 
2Chron
15:16  And he also removed Ma‛aḵah,
the mother of Asa the sovereign, from being sovereigness mother, because she
had made an abominable image of Ashĕrah. And Asa cut down her abominable image,
and crushed it, and burned it by the wadi Qiḏron. 
2Chron
15:17  Yet the high places were not
removed from Yisra’ĕl. However, the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.

2Chron
15:18  And he brought into the House of
Elohim the set-apart items of his father and his own set-apart items: silver
and gold and utensils. 
2Chron
15:19  And there was no more fighting
until the thirty-fifth year of the reign of Asa. 
2Chron
16:1  In the thirty-sixth year of the
reign of Asa, Ba‛asha the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl came up against Yehuḏah
and built Ramah, to prevent anyone going out or coming in to Asa, sovereign of
Yehuḏah. 
2Chron
16:2  And Asa brought silver and gold
from the treasuries of the House of יהוה and of the
sovereign’s house, and sent to Ben-Haḏaḏ sovereign of Aram, who
dwelt in Darmeseq, saying, 
2Chron
16:3  “Let there be a covenant between
you and me, as there was between my father and your father. See, I have sent
you silver and gold. Come, break your covenant with Ba‛asha sovereign of
Yisra’ĕl, so that he withdraws from me.” 
2Chron
16:4  And Ben-Haḏaḏ listened
to Sovereign Asa and sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of
Yisra’ĕl, and they smote Iyon, and Dan, and Aḇĕl Mayim, and all
the storage cities of Naphtali. 
2Chron
16:5  And it came to be, when Ba‛asha
heard it, that he stopped building Ramah and ceased his work. 
2Chron
16:6  Then Asa the sovereign brought all
Yehuḏah, and they took away the stones and timber of Ramah, which Ba‛asha
had used for building. And with them he built Geḇa and Mitspah. 
2Chron
16:7  And at that time Ḥanani the
seer came to Asa sovereign of Yehuḏah, and said to him, “Because you have
relied on the sovereign of Aram, and have not relied on יהוה
your Elohim, therefore the army of the sovereign of Aram has escaped from your
hand. 
2Chron
16:8  “Were the Kushites and the Luḇim
not a mighty army with very many chariots and horsemen? And because you relied
on יהוה, He gave them into your hand. 
2Chron
16:9  “For the eyes of יהוה
diligently search throughout all the earth, to show Himself strong on behalf of
those whose heart is perfect to Him. You have acted foolishly in this, so from
now on you shall have battles.” 
2Chron
16:10  And Asa was wroth with the seer,
and put him in prison, for he was
enraged at him because of this. And Asa oppressed some of the people at that
time. 
2Chron
16:11  And look, the acts of Asa, the
first and the last, see, they are written in the book of the sovereigns of Yehuḏah
and Yisra’ĕl. 
2Chron
16:12  And in the thirty-ninth year of
his reign, Asa became diseased in his feet, and his disease was severe. Yet
even in his disease he did not seek יהוה, but the
physicians. 
2Chron
16:13  So Asa slept with his fathers, and
died in the forty-first year of his reign. 
2Chron
16:14  And they buried him in his own
tomb, which he had made for himself in the City of Dawiḏ. And they laid
him in the bed which was filled with spices and various kinds of ointments
mixed by the perfumer’s skill. And they made a very great burning for him. 
2Chron
17:1  And Yehoshaphat his son reigned in
his place, and strengthened himself against Yisra’ĕl, 
2Chron
17:2  and placed an army in all the
walled cities of Yehuḏah, and set watch-posts in the land of Yehuḏah
and in the cities of Ephrayim which Asa his father had taken. 
2Chron
17:3  And יהוה
was with Yehoshaphat, for he walked in the former ways of his father Dawiḏ,
and did not seek the Ba‛als, 
2Chron
17:4  but sought the Elohim of his
father, and walked in His commands and not according to the deeds of Yisra’ĕl.

2Chron
17:5  So יהוה
established the reign in his hand. And all Yehuḏah gave presents to
Yehoshaphat, and he had great riches and esteem. 
2Chron
17:6  And his heart was exalted in the
ways of יהוה, and he again removed the high places and
the Ashĕrim from Yehuḏah. 
2Chron
17:7  And in the third year of his reign
he sent his leaders, Ben-Ḥayil, and Oḇaḏyah, and Zeḵaryah,
and Nethanĕ’l, and Miḵayahu, to teach in the cities of Yehuḏah.

2Chron
17:8  And with them he sent Lĕwites:
Shemayahu, and Nethanyahu, and Zeḇaḏyahu, and Asah’ĕl, and
Shemiramoth, and Yehonathan, and Aḏoniyahu, and Toḇiyahu, and Toḇaḏoniyah,
the Lĕwites, and with them Elishama and Yehoram, the priests. 
2Chron
17:9  And they taught in Yehuḏah,
and with them was the Book of the Torah of יהוה. And
they went around into all the cities of Yehuḏah and taught the people. 
2Chron
17:10  And the fear of יהוה
fell on all the reigns of the lands that were around Yehuḏah, and they
did not fight against Yehoshaphat. 
2Chron
17:11  And some of the Philistines
brought Yehoshaphat gifts and a load of silver. And the Araḇians brought
him flocks, seven thousand seven hundred rams and seven thousand seven hundred
male goats. 
2Chron
17:12  And Yehoshaphat became
increasingly great, and he built palaces and storage cities in Yehuḏah. 
2Chron
17:13  And he had much work in the cities
of Yehuḏah. And the men of battle, mighty brave men, were in
Yerushalayim. 
2Chron
17:14  And these were their numbers,
according to their fathers’ houses: Of Yehuḏah, the commanders of
thousands: Aḏnah the commander, and with him three hundred thousand
mighty brave men; 
2Chron
17:15  and next to him was
Yehoḥanan the commander, and with him two hundred and eighty thousand; 
2Chron
17:16  and next to him was Amasyah son of
Ziḵri, who volunteered himself to יהוה, and with
him two hundred thousand mighty brave men. 
2Chron
17:17  And of Binyamin: Elyaḏa, a
mighty brave one, and with him two hundred thousand men armed with bow and
shield; 
2Chron
17:18  and next to him was Yehozaḇaḏ,
and with him one hundred and eighty thousand prepared for battle. 
2Chron
17:19  These were the ones serving the
sovereign, besides those whom the sovereign put in the walled cities throughout
all Yehuḏah. 
2Chron
18:1  And Yehoshaphat had great riches
and esteem, and allied himself with Aḥaḇ by marriage. 
2Chron
18:2  And some years later he went down
to visit Aḥaḇ in Shomeron. And Aḥaḇ slaughtered many
sheep and cattle for him and the people with him, and incited him to go up with
him to Ramoth Gil‛ad. 
2Chron
18:3  And Aḥaḇ sovereign of
Yisra’ĕl said to Yehoshaphat sovereign of Yehuḏah, “Do you go with
me against Ramoth Gil‛ad?” And he answered him, “I am as you are, and my
people as your people, even with you in battle.” 
2Chron
18:4  And Yehoshaphat said to the
sovereign of Yisra’ĕl, “Please inquire for the word of יהוה
today.” 
2Chron
18:5  And the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl
gathered the prophets together, four hundred men, and said to them, “Do we go
against Ramoth Gil‛ad to battle, or do I refrain?” And they said, “Go up,
for Elohim does give it into the sovereign’s hand.” 
2Chron
18:6  But Yehoshaphat said, “Is there not
still a prophet of יהוה here, so that we inquire of
him?” 
2Chron
18:7  And the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl
said to Yehoshaphat, “There is still one man to inquire of יהוה
from him; but I hate him, because he never prophesies good concerning me, but
always evil. He is Miḵayehu, the son of Yimla.” And Yehoshaphat said, “Let
not the sovereign say so!” 
2Chron
18:8  So the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl
called one of his officers and said, “Bring Miḵahu son of Yimla at once!”

2Chron
18:9  And the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl
and Yehoshaphat the sovereign of Yehuḏah, dressed in their robes, sat
each on his throne. And they sat at a threshing-floor at the entrance of the
gate of Shomeron. And all the prophets were prophesying before them. 
2Chron
18:10  And Tsiḏqiyahu son of Kena‛anah
had made horns of iron for himself, and said, “Thus said יהוה,
‘With these you push the Arameans until they are destroyed.’ ” 
2Chron
18:11  And all the prophets were
prophesying so, saying, “Go up to Ramoth Gil‛ad and prosper, and יהוה
shall give it into the hand of the sovereign.” 
2Chron
18:12  And the messenger who had gone to
call Miḵayehu spoke to him, saying, “See, the words of the prophets with
one mouth are good towards the sovereign. So please let your word be like the
word of one of them, and you shall speak good.” 
2Chron
18:13  And Miḵayehu said, “As יהוה
lives, whatever my Elohim says, that I speak.” 
2Chron
18:14  And he came to the sovereign. And
the sovereign said to him, “Miḵah, do we go against Ramoth Gil‛ad
to battle, or do I refrain?” And he said, “Go and prosper, and they are given
into your hand!” 
2Chron
18:15  And the sovereign said to him, “How
many times have I made you swear that you do not speak to me, except the truth,
in the Name of יהוה ?” 
2Chron
18:16  So he said, “I saw all Yisra’ĕl
scattered on the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd. And יהוה
said, ‘These have no master. Let each return to his house in peace.’ ” 
2Chron
18:17  And the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl
said to Yehoshaphat, “Did I not say to you that he would not prophesy good
concerning me, but evil?” 
2Chron
18:18  Then he said, “Therefore hear the
word of יהוה : I saw יהוה
sitting on His throne, and all the host of the heavens standing on His right
and on His left. 
2Chron
18:19  “And יהוה
said, ‘Who shall entice Aḥaḇ sovereign of Yisra’ĕl to go up
and fall at Ramoth Gil‛ad?’ And one said this, and another said that. 
2Chron
18:20  “And a spirit came forward and
stood before יהוה, and said, ‘Let me entice him.’ יהוה
said to him, ‘In what way?’ 
2Chron
18:21  “And he said, ‘I shall go out and
be a spirit of falsehood in the mouth of all his prophets.’ And He said, ‘Entice
him, and also prevail. Go out and do so.’ 
2Chron
18:22  “And now, see, יהוה
has put a spirit of falsehood in the mouth of these prophets of yours, and יהוה
has spoken evil concerning you.”
2Chron
18:23  And Tsiḏqiyahu son of Kena‛anah
came near and smote Miḵayehu on the cheek, and said, “Which way did the
spirit of יהוה pass over from me to speak to you?” 
2Chron
18:24  And Miḵayehu said, “Look,
you shall see on that day when you go into an inner room to hide!” 
2Chron
18:25  Then the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl
said, “Take Miḵayehu, and return him to Amon the governor of the city and
to Yo’ash the sovereign’s son, 
2Chron
18:26  and say, ‘Thus said the sovereign,
“Put this one in prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and water of
affliction until I return in peace.” ’ ” 
2Chron
18:27  And Miḵayehu said, “If you
return at all in peace, יהוה has not spoken by me.” And
he said, “Hear, all you people!” 
2Chron
18:28  Then the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl
and Yehoshaphat the sovereign of Yehuḏah went up to Ramoth Gil‛ad. 
2Chron
18:29  And the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl
said to Yehoshaphat, “Let me disguise myself and go into battle, but you put on
your robes.” And the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl disguised himself, and they
went into battle. 
2Chron
18:30  And the sovereign of Aram had
commanded the commanders of the chariots who were with him, saying, “Fight with
no one small or great, but only with the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl.”
2Chron
18:31  And it came to be, when the
commanders of the chariots saw Yehoshaphat, that they said, “It is the
sovereign of Yisra’ĕl!” So they turned around to fight against him, and
Yehoshaphat cried out, and יהוה helped him, and Elohim
moved them to turn away from him. 
2Chron
18:32  And it came to be, when the
commanders of the chariots saw that it was not the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl,
that they turned back from pursuing him. 
2Chron
18:33  And a man drew a bow in his
simplicity, and smote the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl between the joints of his
armour. And he said to the driver of his chariot, “Turn around and take me out
of the battle, for I am wounded.” 
2Chron
18:34  But the battle increased that day,
and the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl was propped up in his chariot facing the
Arameans until evening, and he died at the time of the going down of the sun. 
2Chron
19:1  And Yehoshaphat the sovereign of
Yehuḏah returned to his house in peace in Yerushalayim. 
2Chron
19:2  And Yĕhu son of Ḥanani
the seer went out to face him, and said to Sovereign Yehoshaphat, “Do you help
the wrong and love those who hate יהוה ? Therefore the
wrath of יהוה is upon you. 
2Chron
19:3  “But good matters are found in you,
in that you have removed the Ashĕroth from the land, and have prepared
your heart to seek Elohim.” 
2Chron
19:4  So Yehoshaphat dwelt in Yerushalayim,
and he went out again among the people from Be’ĕrsheḇa to the hill
country of Ephrayim, and brought them back to יהוה
Elohim of their fathers. 
2Chron
19:5  And he appointed judges in the land
in all the walled cities of Yehuḏah, city by city, 
2Chron
19:6  and said to the judges, “Watch what
you are doing, for you do not judge for man, but for יהוה
who is with you in the matter of right-ruling. 
2Chron
19:7  “And now, let the fear of יהוה
be upon you. Guard and do it, for there is no unrighteousness with יהוה
our Elohim, nor partiality, nor taking of bribes.” 
2Chron
19:8  And in Yerushalayim Yehoshaphat
also appointed some of the Lĕwites and priests, and some of the chief
fathers of Yisra’ĕl, for the right-ruling of יהוה
and for dispute. Then they returned to Yerushalayim. 
2Chron
19:9  And he commanded them, saying, “Do
this in the fear of יהוה, trustworthily and with a
perfect heart: 
2Chron
19:10  “When any dispute comes to you
from your brothers who dwell in their cities, between blood and blood, between
Torah and command, laws and right-rulings, then you shall warn them, lest they
trespass against יהוה and wrath come upon you and your
brothers. Do this, and you shall not be guilty. 
2Chron
19:11  “And look, Amaryahu the chief
priest is over you in all matters of יהוה. And Zeḇaḏyahu
son of Yishma‛ĕl, the ruler of the house of Yehuḏah, for all
the matters of the sovereign, and the Lĕwites are officials before you. Be
strong and do, and יהוה is with the good.” 
2Chron
20:1  And after this it came to be that
the children of Mo’aḇ and the children of Ammon came in, and with them
some of the peoples, against Yehoshaphat to battle. 
2Chron
20:2  And they came and spoke to
Yehoshaphat, saying, “A great army is coming against you from beyond the sea,
from Aram. And see, they are in Ḥatsatson Tamar,” which is Ĕn Geḏi.

2Chron
20:3  And Yehoshaphat was afraid, and set
his face to seek יהוה, and proclaimed a fast throughout
all Yehuḏah. 
2Chron
20:4  And Yehuḏah gathered to
inquire of יהוה, even from all the cities of Yehuḏah
they came to seek יהוה. 
2Chron
20:5  And Yehoshaphat stood in the
assembly of Yehuḏah and Yerushalayim, in the House of יהוה,
in front of the new courtyard, 
2Chron
20:6  and said, “O יהוה
Elohim of our fathers, are You not Elohim in the heavens, and do You not rule
over all the reigns of the nations, and in Your hand is there not power and
might, so that no one is able to stand against You? 
2Chron
20:7  “Are You not our Elohim? You have
driven out the inhabitants of this land before Your people Yisra’ĕl, and
gave it to the seed of Aḇraham Your friend forever. 
2Chron
20:8  “And they dwell in it, and have
built You a set-apart place in it for Your Name, saying, 
2Chron
20:9  ‘If evil does come upon us, such as
the sword, judgment, or pestilence, or scarcity of food, we shall stand before
this House and in Your presence – for Your Name is in this House – and cry out
to You in our distress, and You do hear and save.’ 
2Chron
20:10  “And now, see, the children of
Ammon and Mo’aḇ, and Mount Sĕ‛ir, whom You would not let Yisra’ĕl
invade when they came out of the land of Mitsrayim, for they turned from them
and did not destroy them, 
2Chron
20:11  and see, they are repaying us by
coming in to drive us out of Your possession which You have given us to
inherit. 
2Chron
20:12  “O our Elohim, would You not judge
them? For we are powerless against this great army that is coming against us.
And we do not know what to do, but our eyes are upon You.” 
2Chron
20:13  And all Yehuḏah, with their
little ones, their wives, and their children, stood before יהוה.

2Chron
20:14  And the Spirit of יהוה
came upon Yaḥazi’ĕl son of Zeḵaryahu, son of Benayah, son of
Ye‛i’ĕl, son of Mattanyah, a Lĕwite of the sons of Asaph, in
the midst of the assembly, 
2Chron
20:15  and he said, “Listen, all Yehuḏah,
and you inhabitants of Yerushalayim, and Sovereign Yehoshaphat! Thus said יהוה
to you, ‘Do not fear, nor be afraid of the face of this great army, for the battle
is not yours, but Elohim’s. 
2Chron
20:16  ‘Go down against them tomorrow.
See, they are coming up by the ascent of Tsits, and you shall find them at the
end of the wadi before the Wilderness of Yeru’ĕl. 
2Chron
20:17  ‘It is not for you to fight in this.
Position yourselves, stand still and see the deliverance of יהוה
with you, O Yehuḏah and Yerushalayim!’ Do not be afraid nor fear, go out
against them tomorrow, for יהוה is with you.” 
2Chron
20:18  And Yehoshaphat bowed his head
with his face to the ground, and all Yehuḏah and the inhabitants of
Yerushalayim fell down before יהוה, to bow themselves
before יהוה. 
2Chron
20:19  And the Lĕwites, of the
children of the Qehathites and of the children of the Qorḥites stood up
to praise יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl with exceedingly
loud voice. 
2Chron
20:20  And they rose early in the morning
and went out into the Wilderness of Teqowa. And as they went out, Yehoshaphat
stood and said, “Hear me, O Yehuḏah and you inhabitants of Yerushalayim:
Trust in יהוה your Elohim and be steadfast, trust His
prophets and prosper.” 
2Chron
20:21  And after consulting with the
people, he appointed those who should sing to יהוה, and
who should praise the splendour of set-apartness, as they went out before the
army and were saying, “Give thanks to יהוה, for His
kindness is everlasting.” 
2Chron
20:22  And when they began singing and
praising, יהוה set ambushes against the children of
Ammon, Mo’aḇ, and Mount Sĕ‛ir, who had come against Yehuḏah,
and they were smitten. 
2Chron
20:23  Then the children of Ammon and Mo’aḇ
stood up against the inhabitants of Mount Sĕ‛ir to destroy and
annihilate them. And when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Sĕ‛ir,
they helped to destroy one another. 
2Chron
20:24  And when Yehuḏah came at the
lookout in the wilderness, they looked toward the army and saw their dead
bodies, lying on the ground, and none had escaped. 
2Chron
20:25  And Yehoshaphat and his people
came to take away their spoil, and they found among them a great amount of
valuables on the dead bodies, and precious jewelry, which they stripped off for
themselves, more than they could take away. And they were three days plundering
the spoil, for it was much. 
2Chron
20:26  And on the fourth day they
assembled in the Valley of Beraḵah, for there they blessed יהוה.
Therefore the name of that place was called The Valley of Beraḵah to this
day. 
2Chron
20:27  Then they returned, every man of
Yehuḏah and Yerushalayim, with Yehoshaphat in front of them, to go back
to Yerushalayim with joy, for יהוה had made them
rejoice over their enemies. 
2Chron
20:28  And they came to Yerushalayim,
with harps and lyres and trumpets, to the House of יהוה.

2Chron
20:29  And the fear of Elohim was on all
the reigns of the lands when they heard that יהוה had
fought against the enemies of Yisra’ĕl. 
2Chron
20:30  Then the reign of Yehoshaphat was
at peace, for his Elohim gave him rest on all sides. 
2Chron
20:31  Thus Yehoshaphat reigned over Yehuḏah
– thirty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-five
years in Yerushalayim. And his mother’s name was Azuḇah the daughter of
Shilḥi. 
2Chron
20:32  And he walked in the way of his
father Asa and did not turn aside from it, doing what was right in the eyes of יהוה.

2Chron
20:33  Only, the high places were not
taken away, for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts for the Elohim
of their fathers. 
2Chron
20:34  And the rest of the acts of
Yehoshaphat, the first and the last, see, they are written in the book of Yĕhu
son of Ḥanani, which is mentioned in the book of the sovereigns of Yisra’ĕl.

2Chron
20:35  And after this Yehoshaphat
sovereign of Yehuḏah joined himself with Aḥazyah sovereign of Yisra’ĕl.
He did wrong in doing so. 
2Chron
20:36  And he joined himself with him to
make ships to go to Tarshish, and they made the ships in Etsyon Geḇer. 
2Chron
20:37  Then Eli‛ezer son of Doḏawahu
of Marĕshah prophesied against Yehoshaphat, saying, “Because you have
joined yourself with Aḥazyahu, יהוה shall break
up your work.” And the ships were wrecked, so that they were unable to go to
Tarshish. 
2Chron
21:1  And Yehoshaphat slept with his
fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the City of Dawiḏ. And
Yehoram his son reigned in his place. 
2Chron
21:2  And he had brothers, the sons of
Yehoshaphat: Azaryahu, and Yeḥi’ĕl, and Zeḵaryahu, and
Azaryahu, and Miḵa’ĕl, and Shephatyahu. All these were sons of
Yehoshaphat sovereign of Yisra’ĕl. 
2Chron
21:3  And their father gave them many
gifts of silver and gold and precious items, with walled cities in Yehuḏah,
but he had given the reign to Yehoram because he was the first-born. 
2Chron
21:4  And when Yehoram had risen up over
the reign of his father and made himself strong, he slew all his brothers with
the sword, and also others of the heads of Yisra’ĕl. 
2Chron
21:5  Yehoram was thirty-two years old
when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Yerushalayim. 
2Chron
21:6  And he walked in the way of the
sovereigns of Yisra’ĕl, as the house of Aḥaḇ had done, for he
had the daughter of Aḥaḇ as a wife. And he did evil in the eyes of יהוה.

2Chron
21:7  However, יהוה
would not destroy the house of Dawiḏ, because of the covenant He had made
with Dawiḏ, and since He had promised to give a lamp to him and to his
sons, all the days. 
2Chron
21:8  In his days the Eḏomites
revolted from under the hand of Yehuḏah, and appointed a sovereign over
themselves. 
2Chron
21:9  Then Yehoram went out with his
officers, and all his chariots with him. And it came to be that he rose by
night and smote the Eḏomites who had surrounded him and the commanders of
the chariots. 
2Chron
21:10  Thus the Eḏomites revolted
from under the hand of Yehuḏah to this day. Then Liḇnah revolted
from under his hand, because he had forsaken יהוה Elohim
of his fathers. 
2Chron
21:11  He had also made high places in
the mountains of Yehuḏah, and caused the inhabitants of Yerushalayim to
commit whoring, and led Yehuḏah astray. 
2Chron
21:12  And a letter came to him from Ĕliyahu
the prophet, saying, Thus said יהוה Elohim of your
father Dawiḏ, “Because you have not walked in the ways of Yehoshaphat
your father, or in the ways of Asa sovereign of Yehuḏah, 
2Chron
21:13  but have walked in the way of the
sovereigns of Yisra’ĕl, and have made Yehuḏah and the inhabitants of
Yerushalayim to commit whoring like the whorings of the house of Aḥaḇ,
and also have slain your brothers, those of your father’s household, who were
better than yourself, 
2Chron
21:14  see, יהוה
is going to strike with a great blow among your people, your children, your
wives, and all your possessions, 
2Chron
21:15  and you, with many sicknesses,
with disease of your intestines, until your intestines come out because of the
sickness, day by day.” 
2Chron
21:16  And יהוה
stirred up the spirit of the Philistines against Yehoram, and of the Araḇians
who were near the Kushites. 
2Chron
21:17  And they came up into Yehuḏah
and broke into it, and captured all the possessions that were found in the
sovereign’s house, and also his sons and his wives, so that there was not a son
left to him except Yeho’aḥaz, the youngest of his sons. 
2Chron
21:18  And after all this יהוה
plagued him in his intestines with a disease for which there was no healing. 
2Chron
21:19  And it came to be in the course of
time, at the end of two years, that his intestines came out because of his
sickness, and he died in great pain. And his people made no burning for him,
like the burning for his fathers. 
2Chron
21:20  He was thirty-two years old when
he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Yerushalayim, to no one’s
regret, and passed away. And they buried him in the City of Dawiḏ, but
not in the tombs of the sovereigns. 
2Chron
22:1  And the inhabitants of Yerushalayim
set up Aḥazyahu his youngest son to reign in his place, for the raiding
band that came with the Araḇians into the camp had slain all the older
sons. So Aḥazyahu son of Yehoram, sovereign of Yehuḏah, reigned. 
2Chron
22:2  Aḥazyahu was forty-two years
old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Yerushalayim one year. And his
mother’s name was Athalyahu the granddaughter of Omri. 
2Chron
22:3  He too walked in the ways of the
house of Aḥaḇ, for his mother counselled him to do wrong. 
2Chron
22:4  And he did evil in the eyes of יהוה,
like the house of Aḥaḇ, for they were his counsellors after the
death of his father, to his destruction.
2Chron
22:5  He also walked in their counsel,
and went with Yehoram son of Aḥaḇ sovereign of Yisra’ĕl to
fight against Ḥaza’ĕl sovereign of Aram at Ramoth Gil‛ad. And
the Arameans smote Yoram, 
2Chron
22:6  and he returned to Yizre‛ĕl
to recover from the wounds which he had received at Ramah, when he fought
against Ḥaza’ĕl sovereign of Aram. And Azaryahu son of Yehoram,
sovereign of Yehuḏah, went down to see Yehoram son of Aḥaḇ in
Yizre‛ĕl, for he was sick. 
2Chron
22:7  But from Elohim came the downfall
of Aḥazyahu, through his coming to Yoram. For when he came he went out
with Yehoram against Yĕhu son of Nimshi, whom יהוה
had anointed to cut off the house of Aḥaḇ. 
2Chron
22:8  And it came to be, when Yĕhu
was executing judgment on the house of Aḥaḇ, that he found the
rulers of Yehuḏah and the sons of Aḥazyahu’s brothers who served
Aḥazyahu, and slew them. 
2Chron
22:9  So he searched for Aḥazyahu,
and they caught him while he was hiding in Shomeron, and brought him to Yĕhu,
and put him to death, then buried him, for they said, “He is the son of
Yehoshaphat, who sought יהוה with all his heart.” And
there was none in the house of Aḥazyahu strong enough to reign. 
2Chron
22:10  And when Athalyahu the mother of
Aḥazyahu saw that her son was dead, she rose up and destroyed all the
offspring of the reign of the house of Yehuḏah. 
2Chron
22:11  But Yehoshaḇ‛ath, the
daughter of the sovereign, took Yo’ash son of Aḥazyahu, and stole him
away from among the sovereign’s sons who were slain, and put him and his nurse
in a bedroom. So Yehoshaḇ‛ath, the daughter of Sovereign Yehoram,
the wife of Yehoyaḏa the priest, because she was the sister of
Aḥazyahu, hid him from Athalyahu so that she could not put him to death. 
2Chron
22:12  And he was hidden with them in the
House of Elohim for six years, while Athalyah was reigning over the land. 
2Chron
23:1  And in the seventh year Yehoyaḏa
strengthened himself, and made a covenant with the commanders of hundreds:
Azaryah son of Yeroḥam, and Yishma‛ĕl son of Yehoḥanan,
and Azaryahu son of Oḇĕḏ, and Ma‛asĕyahu son of Aḏayahu,
and Elishaphat son of Ziḵri.
2Chron
23:2  And they went about through Yehuḏah
and gathered the Lĕwites from all the cities of Yehuḏah, and the
chiefs of the fathers of Yisra’ĕl, and they came to Yerushalayim. 
2Chron
23:3  And all the assembly made a
covenant with the sovereign in the House of Elohim. And he said to them, “See,
the son of the sovereign is to reign, as יהוה has said
of the sons of Dawiḏ. 
2Chron
23:4  “This is what you do: One-third of
you entering on the Sabbath, of the priests and the Lĕwites, gatekeepers
of the thresholds; 
2Chron
23:5  and one-third are at the sovereign’s
house, and one-third at the Gate of the Foundation, while all the people are in
the courtyards of the House of יהוה. 
2Chron
23:6  “And let no one come into the House
of יהוה except the priests and those of the Lĕwites
who serve – they go in, for they are set-apart. But all the people are to guard
the Charge of יהוה. 
2Chron
23:7  “And the Lĕwites shall
surround the sovereign on all sides, every man with his weapons in his hand.
And whoever comes into the house, let him be put to death. And be with the
sovereign when he comes in and when he goes out.” 
2Chron
23:8  And the Lĕwites and all Yehuḏah
did according to all that Yehoyaḏa the priest commanded. And each man
took his men who were to come in on the Sabbath, with those going out on the
Sabbath, for Yehoyaḏa the priest did not dismiss the divisions. 
2Chron
23:9  And Yehoyaḏa the priest gave
to the commanders of hundreds the spears and the large and small shields which
had been Sovereign Dawiḏ’s, that were in the House of Elohim. 
2Chron
23:10  And he set all the people, every
man with his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the House to the left
side of the House, along by the altar and by the House, all around the
sovereign. 
2Chron
23:11  And they brought out the son of
the sovereign and put on him the diadem and the Witness, and set him up to
reign. Then Yehoyaḏa and his sons anointed him, and said, “Let the
sovereign live!” 
2Chron
23:12  And Athalyahu heard the noise of
the people running and praising the sovereign, and she came to the people in
the House of יהוה, 
2Chron
23:13  and looked and saw the sovereign
standing by his column at the entrance. And the chiefs and the trumpeters were
beside the sovereign, and all the people of the land rejoicing and blowing
trumpets, also the singers with instruments of song, and those who led in
praise. Then Athalyahu tore her garments and said, “Treason! Treason!” 
2Chron
23:14  And Yehoyaḏa the priest
brought out the commanders of hundreds who were set over the army, and said to
them, “Take her outside the ranks, and slay with the sword whoever follows her.”
For the priest said, “Do not kill her in the House of יהוה.”

2Chron
23:15  So they laid hands on her, and she
went by way of the entrance of the Horse Gate into the sovereign’s house, and
they put her to death there. 
2Chron
23:16  Yehoyaḏa then made a
covenant – between himself and the people and the sovereign – to be the people
of יהוה. 
2Chron
23:17  And all the people went to the
house of Ba‛al, and broke it down. They completely broke up its altars
and images, and slew Mattan the priest of Ba‛al before the altars. 
2Chron
23:18  And Yehoyaḏa put the offices
of the House of יהוה into the hand of the priests, the
Lĕwites, whom Dawiḏ had assigned in the House of יהוה,
to offer the burnt offerings of יהוה, as it is written
in the Torah of Mosheh, with rejoicing and with singing, by the hands of Dawiḏ.

2Chron
23:19  And he set the gatekeepers at the
gates of the House of יהוה, so that no one who was in
any way unclean should enter. 
2Chron
23:20  And he took the commanders of
hundreds, and the nobles, and the governors of the people, and all the people
of the land, and brought the sovereign down from the House of יהוה.
And they went through the Upper Gate to the sovereign’s house, and set the
sovereign on the throne of the reign. 
2Chron
23:21  And all the people of the land
rejoiced. And the city had rest, for they had slain Athalyahu with the sword. 
2Chron
24:1  Yo’ash was seven years old when he
began to reign, and he reigned forty years in Yerushalayim. And the name of his
mother was Tsiḇyah of Be’ĕrsheḇa. 
2Chron
24:2  And Yo’ash did what was right in
the eyes of יהוה all the days of Yehoyaḏa the
priest. 
2Chron
24:3  And Yehoyaḏa took for him two
wives, and he brought forth sons and daughters. 
2Chron
24:4  And after this it came to be that
Yo’ash set his heart on restoring the House of יהוה. 
2Chron
24:5  And he gathered the priests and the
Lĕwites, and said to them, “Go out to the cities of Yehuḏah, and
gather from all Yisra’ĕl silver to repair the House of your Elohim from
year to year, and see that you hurry the matter.” But the Lĕwites did not
hurry it. 
2Chron
24:6  And the sovereign called Yehoyaḏa
the chief, and said to him, “Why have you not required the Lĕwites to
bring in from Yehuḏah and from Yerushalayim the levy of Mosheh the
servant of יהוה and of the assembly of Yisra’ĕl,
for the Tent of the Witness?” 
2Chron
24:7  For the sons of Athalyahu, that
wrong woman, had broken into the House of Elohim, and had also prepared all the
set-apart vessels of the House of יהוה
to the Ba‛als. 
2Chron
24:8  So the sovereign commanded and they
made a chest, and set it outside at the gate of the House of יהוה,

2Chron
24:9  and made it known in Yehuḏah
and in Yerushalayim to bring to יהוה the levy that
Mosheh the servant of Elohim had imposed on Yisra’ĕl in the wilderness. 
2Chron
24:10  And all the rulers and all the
people rejoiced, and they brought in and put them into the chest to completion.

2Chron
24:11  And it came to be, at that time,
when the chest was brought to the sovereign’s official by the hand of the Lĕwites,
and when they saw that there was much silver, that the sovereign’s scribe and
the high priest’s officer came and emptied the chest, and took it and returned
it to its place. So they did day by day, and gathered a large amount of silver.

2Chron
24:12  And the sovereign and Yehoyaḏa
gave it to those who did the work of the service of the House of יהוה.
And they hired stonemasons and carpenters to restore the House of יהוה,
and also those who worked in iron and bronze to repair the House of יהוה.  
2Chron
24:13  And the workmen laboured, and the
work of restoration progressed in their hands, and they established the House
of Elohim to its proper form and strengthened it. 
2Chron
24:14  And when they had finished, they
brought the rest of the silver before the sovereign and Yehoyaḏa, and
they made utensils from it for the House of יהוה,
utensils for serving and offering, ladles and vessels of gold and silver. And
they offered burnt offerings in the House of יהוה
continually all the days of Yehoyaḏa. 
2Chron
24:15  And Yehoyaḏa was old and
satisfied with days, and died, one hundred and thirty years old when he died. 
2Chron
24:16  And they buried him in the City of
Dawiḏ among the sovereigns, for he had done good in Yisra’ĕl, both
toward Elohim and His house. 
2Chron
24:17  And after the death of Yehoyaḏa
the rulers of Yehuḏah came and bowed themselves to the sovereign. And the
sovereign listened to them, 
2Chron
24:18  and they forsook the House of יהוה
Elohim of their fathers, and served the Ashĕrim and the idols. And wrath
came upon Yehuḏah and Yerushalayim because of their trespass. 
2Chron
24:19  And He sent prophets to them, to
bring them back to יהוה. And they witnessed against
them, but they did not listen. 
2Chron
24:20  Then the Spirit of Elohim came
upon Zeḵaryah son of Yehoyaḏa the priest, who stood above the
people, and said to them, “Thus said Elohim, ‘Why are you transgressing the
commands of יהוה, and do not prosper? Because you have
forsaken יהוה, He has forsaken you.’ ”
2Chron
24:21  And they conspired against him,
and at the command of the sovereign they stoned him with stones in the
courtyard of the House of יהוה. 
2Chron
24:22  Thus Yo’ash the sovereign did not remember
the kindness which Yehoyaḏa his father had done to him, and slew his son.
And as he died, he said, “ יהוה does see, and repay!” 
2Chron
24:23  And it came to be, at the turn of
the year, that the army of Aram came up against him. And they came into Yehuḏah
and Yerushalayim, and destroyed all the rulers of the people from among the
people, and sent all their spoil to the sovereign of Darmeseq. 
2Chron
24:24  For the army of Aram came with few
men, but יהוה gave a very great army into their hand,
because they had forsaken יהוה Elohim of their fathers.
So they executed judgment against Yo’ash. 
2Chron
24:25  And when they had withdrawn from
him – for they left him very sick – his own servants conspired against him
because of the blood of the sons of Yehoyaḏa the priest, and slew him on
his bed, and he died. And they buried him in the City of Dawiḏ, but they
did not bury him in the tombs of the sovereigns. 
2Chron
24:26  And these are the ones who
conspired against him: Zaḇaḏ the son of Shim‛ath the Ammonitess,
and Yehozaḇaḏ the son of Shimrith the Mo’aḇitess. 
2Chron
24:27  As to his sons, and the many words
about him, and the rebuilding of the House of Elohim, see, they are written in
the commentary of the book of the sovereigns. And Amatsyahu his son reigned in
his place. 
2Chron
25:1  Amatsyahu was twenty-five years old
when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Yerushalayim. And
the name of his mother was Yehoaddan of Yerushalayim. 
2Chron
25:2  And he did what was right in the
eyes of יהוה, but not with a perfect heart. 
2Chron
25:3  And it came to be, upon his strong control of the reign, that he slew his
servants who had smitten his father the sovereign. 
2Chron
25:4  But he did not put their children
to death, but did as it is written in the Torah in the Book of Mosheh, where יהוה
commanded, saying, “Fathers are not put to death for their children, and
children are not put to death for their fathers, but each one has to die for
his own sin.” 
2Chron
25:5  And Amatsyahu gathered Yehuḏah
and set over them commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds, according
to the fathers’ houses, for all Yehuḏah and Binyamin. And he registered
them from twenty years old and above, and found them to be three hundred
thousand choice men going out to the army, handling spear and shield. 
2Chron
25:6  And he hired one hundred thousand
mighty brave ones from Yisra’ĕl for one hundred talents of silver. 
2Chron
25:7  But a man of Elohim came to him,
saying, “O sovereign, do not let the army of Yisra’ĕl go with you, for יהוה
is not with Yisra’ĕl, with all the children of Ephrayim. 
2Chron
25:8  “But if you are going, do it! Be
strong in battle, else Elohim would
make you fall before the enemy, for Elohim has power to help and to overthrow.”

2Chron
25:9  And Amatsyahu said to the man of
Elohim, “But what do we do about the hundred talents which I have given to the
army of Yisra’ĕl?” And the man of Elohim answered, “ יהוה
has more to give you than this.” 
2Chron
25:10  So Amatsyahu dismissed the army
that had come to him from Ephrayim, to go back home. And they were greatly
enraged against Yehuḏah, and they returned home in a rage. 
2Chron
25:11  And Amatsyahu strengthened
himself, and led his people, and went to the Valley of Salt and smote ten
thousand of the sons of Sĕ‛ir. 
2Chron
25:12  And the sons of Yehuḏah took
captive another ten thousand alive, and they brought them to the top of the
rock, and threw them down from the top of the rock, and all of them were dashed
to pieces. 
2Chron
25:13  And the soldiers of the army which
Amatsyahu had sent back from going with him to battle, they raided the cities
of Yehuḏah from Shomeron to Bĕyth Ḥoron, and smote three
thousand in them, and took much spoil. 
2Chron
25:14  And it came to be, after Amatsyahu
came from smiting the Eḏomites, that he brought the mighty ones of the
people of Sĕ‛ir, and set them up to be his mighty ones, and bowed
down before them and burned incense to them. 
2Chron
25:15  Therefore the displeasure of יהוה
burned against Amatsyahu, and He sent him a prophet who said to him, “Why have
you sought the mighty ones of the people, which did not deliver their own
people from your hand?” 
2Chron
25:16  And it came to be, as he talked
with him, that the sovereign said to him, “Have we appointed you counsellor to
the sovereign? Stop! Why should they smite you?” Then the prophet stopped and
said, “I know that Elohim has counselled to destroy you, because you have done
this and have not listened to my counsel.” 
2Chron
25:17  And Amatsyahu sovereign of Yehuḏah
took counsel and sent to Yo’ash son of Yeho’aḥaz, son of Yĕhu,
sovereign of Yisra’ĕl, saying, “Come, let us look each other in the face!”

2Chron
25:18  And Yo’ash sovereign of Yisra’ĕl
sent to Amatsyahu sovereign of Yehuḏah, saying, “The thistle that was in
Leḇanon sent to the cedar that was in Leḇanon, saying, ‘Give your
daughter to my son as wife.’ And a wild beast that was in Leḇanon passed
by and trampled the thistle. 
2Chron
25:19  “You have said, ‘See, I have
smitten Eḏom,’ and your heart has lifted you up to boast. Now stay at
home, why should you stir up yourself to evil, that you should fall – you and
Yehuḏah with you?” 
2Chron
25:20  But Amatsyahu did not listen, for
it came from Elohim, in order to give them into the hand of their enemies,
because they had sought the mighty ones of Eḏom. 
2Chron
25:21  So Yo’ash sovereign of Yisra’ĕl
went out. And he and Amatsyahu sovereign of Yehuḏah faced one another at
Bĕyth Shemesh, which belongs to Yehuḏah. 
2Chron
25:22  And Yehuḏah was smitten
before Yisra’ĕl, and they each fled to his tent. 
2Chron
25:23  And Yo’ash the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl
caught Amatsyahu sovereign of Yehuḏah, son of Yo’ash, son of Yeho’aḥaz,
at Bĕyth Shemesh, and brought him to Yerushalayim, and broke down the wall
of Yerushalayim from the Gate of Ephrayim to the Corner Gate, four hundred
cubits, 
2Chron
25:24  and took all the gold and the silver, and all the utensils that were
found in the House of Elohim with Oḇĕḏ-Eḏom, and the
treasures of the sovereign’s house, and hostages, and returned to Shomeron. 
2Chron
25:25  And Amatsyahu son of Yo’ash,
sovereign of Yehuḏah, lived fifteen years after the death of Yo’ash son
of Yeho’aḥaz, sovereign of Yisra’ĕl. 
2Chron
25:26  And the rest of the acts of
Amatsyahu, from the first to the last, see, are they not written in the book of
the sovereigns of Yehuḏah and Yisra’ĕl? 
2Chron
25:27  And from the time that Amatsyahu
turned away from following יהוה, they made a conspiracy
against him in Yerushalayim, and he fled to Laḵish. And they sent after
him to Laḵish and killed him there, 
2Chron
25:28  and they brought him on horses and
buried him with his fathers in the City of Yehuḏah. 
2Chron
26:1  And all the people of Yehuḏah
took Uzziyahu, who was sixteen years old, and set him up to reign instead of
his father Amatsyahu. 
2Chron
26:2  He built Ĕyloth and restored
it to Yehuḏah, after the sovereign slept with his fathers. 
2Chron
26:3  Uzziyahu was sixteen years old when
he began to reign, and he reigned fifty-two years in Yerushalayim. And his
mother’s name was Yeḵolyah of Yerushalayim. 
2Chron
26:4  And he did what was right in the
eyes of יהוה, according to all that his father
Amatsyahu did. 
2Chron
26:5  And he sought Elohim in the days of
Zeḵaryahu, who had understanding in the visions of Elohim. And while he
sought יהוה, Elohim made him prosper. 
2Chron
26:6  And he went out and fought against
the Philistines, and broke down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Yaḇneh,
and the wall of Ashdoḏ, and built cities around Ashdoḏ and among
the Philistines. 
2Chron
26:7  And Elohim helped him against the
Philistines, and against the Araḇians who lived in Gur Ba‛al, and
the Me‛unites. 
2Chron
26:8  And the Ammonites gave gifts to
Uzziyahu. And his name spread as far as the entrance of Mitsrayim, for he
strengthened himself greatly. 
2Chron
26:9  And Uzziyahu built towers in
Yerushalayim at the Corner Gate, and at the Valley Gate, and at the corner
buttress, and strengthened them. 
2Chron
26:10  And he built towers in the
wilderness, and dug many wells, for he had much livestock, both in the low
country and in the plain, farmers and vinedressers in the mountains and in
Karmel, for he loved the soil. 
2Chron
26:11  And Uzziyah had an army of fighting
men who went out to battle by divisions, according to the number on their roll
as prepared by Ye‛i’ĕl the scribe and Ma‛asĕyahu the
officer, under the hand of Ḥananyahu, one of the sovereign’s commanders.
2Chron
26:12  The total number of the clan chiefs
of the mighty brave ones was two thousand six hundred. 
2Chron
26:13  And under their hand was an army
of three hundred and seven thousand five hundred that fought with mighty power,
to help the sovereign against the enemy. 
2Chron
26:14  And Uzziyahu prepared for them,
for the entire army, shields, and spears, and helmets, and body armour, and
bows, and sling stones. 
2Chron
26:15  And he made machines in
Yerushalayim, devised by skilled men, to be on the towers and the corners, to
shoot arrows and large stones. And his name spread far and wide, for he was
marvellously helped till he became strong. 
2Chron
26:16  But when he became strong his
heart was lifted up, to his destruction, for he trespassed against יהוה
his Elohim by entering the Hĕḵal of יהוה to
burn incense on the altar of incense.
2Chron
26:17  And Azaryahu the priest went in
after him, and with him were eighty priests of יהוה,
who were brave men. 
2Chron
26:18  And they stood up against
Sovereign Uzziyahu, and said to him, “It is not for you, Uzziyahu, to burn
incense to יהוה, but for the priests, the sons of
Aharon, who are set-apart to burn incense. Get out of the set-apart place, for
you have trespassed, and there is no esteem to you from יהוה
Elohim.” 
2Chron
26:19  And Uzziyahu was wroth. And he had
a censer in his hand to burn incense. And while he was wroth with the priests,
leprosy broke out on his forehead, before the priests in the House of יהוה,
beside the incense altar. 
2Chron
26:20  And Azaryahu the chief priest and
all the priests looked at him, and saw that he was leprous on his forehead. And
they hurried him from there. And he also hurried to get out, because יהוה
had struck him. 
2Chron
26:21  And Sovereign Uzziyahu was a leper
until the day of his death, and dwelt in a separate house, because he was a
leper, for he was cut off from the House of יהוה. And
Yotham his son was over the sovereign’s house, ruling the people of the land. 
2Chron
26:22  And the rest of the acts of
Uzziyahu, from the first to the last, the prophet Yeshayahu the son of Amots
wrote. 
2Chron
26:23  So Uzziyahu slept with his
fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of burial which
belonged to the sovereigns, for they said, “He is a leper.” And Yotham his son
reigned in his place. 
2Chron
27:1  Yotham was twenty-five years old
when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Yerushalayim. And his
mother’s name was Yerushah the daughter of Tsaḏoq. 
2Chron
27:2  And he did what was right in the
eyes of יהוה, according to all that his father Uzziyahu
had done. Only, he did not come into the Hĕḵal of יהוה.
And the people continued to act corruptly. 
2Chron
27:3  He built the Upper Gate of the
House of יהוה, and he built much on the wall of Ophel. 
2Chron
27:4  And he built cities in the hill
country of Yehuḏah, and in the forests he built palaces and towers. 
2Chron
27:5  And he fought with the sovereign of
the Ammonites and prevailed over them. And the children of Ammon gave him in
that year one hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand kors of wheat, and
ten thousand of barley. This is what the children of Ammon paid him, also in
the second and third years.
2Chron
27:6  And Yotham strengthened himself,
for he prepared his ways before יהוה his Elohim. 
2Chron
27:7  And the rest of the acts of Yotham,
and all his battles and his ways, see, they are written in the book of the
sovereigns of Yisra’ĕl and Yehuḏah. 
2Chron
27:8  He was twenty-five years old when
he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Yerushalayim. 
2Chron
27:9  So Yotham slept with his fathers,
and they buried him in the City of Dawiḏ. And his son Aḥaz reigned
in his place. 
2Chron
28:1  Aḥaz was twenty years old
when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Yerushalayim. And he
did not do what was right in the eyes of יהוה, as his
father Dawiḏ had done, 
2Chron
28:2  and walked in the ways of the
sovereigns of Yisra’ĕl, and made moulded images for the Ba‛als. 
2Chron
28:3  And he himself burned incense in
the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, and burned his children in the fire, according
to the abominations of the gentiles whom יהוה
dispossessed from before the children of Yisra’ĕl, 
2Chron
28:4  and slaughtered and burned incense
on the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree. 
2Chron
28:5  Therefore יהוה
his Elohim gave him into the hand of the sovereign of Aram, and they smote him,
and took many of them away as captives, and brought them to Darmeseq. And he
was also given into the hand of the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl, who smote him
with a great slaughter. 
2Chron
28:6  And Peqaḥ son of Remalyahu
slew one hundred and twenty thousand in Yehuḏah in one day, all brave
men, because they had forsaken יהוה Elohim of their
fathers. 
2Chron
28:7  And Ziḵri, a mighty man of
Ephrayim, slew Ma‛asĕyahu son of the sovereign, and Azriqam the
officer over the house, and Elqanah who was second to the sovereign. 
2Chron
28:8  And the children of Yisra’ĕl
took captive from their brothers two hundred thousand women, sons and
daughters. And they also seized from them much spoil, and they brought the
spoil to Shomeron. 
2Chron
28:9  But a prophet of יהוה
was there, whose name was Oḏĕḏ. And he went out before the
army that came to Shomeron, and said to them, “See, because יהוה
Elohim of your fathers was displeased with Yehuḏah, He has given them
into your hand, and you have slain them in a rage that reaches up to the
heavens. 
2Chron
28:10  “And now you are planning to make
the children of Yehuḏah and Yerushalayim your male and female slaves, but
are you not also guilty before יהוה your Elohim? 
2Chron
28:11  “Now therefore, listen to me, and
return the captives whom you have taken captive from your brothers, for the
heat of the wrath of יהוה is upon you.” 
2Chron
28:12  And some of the heads of the
children of Ephrayim: Azaryahu son of Yehoḥanan, Bereḵyahu son of
Meshillĕmoth, and Yeḥizqiyahu son of Shallum, and Amasa son of Ḥaḏlai,
stood up against those who came from the army, 
2Chron
28:13  and said to them, “Do not bring
the captives here, to bring on us guilt before יהוה.
Are you planning to add to our sins and to our guilt? For our guilt is great,
and burning is the wrath on Yisra’ĕl.” 
2Chron
28:14  And the armed men left the
captives and the spoil before the leaders and all the assembly. 
2Chron
28:15  And the men who were designated by
name rose up and took the captives, and from the spoil they put on all the
naked among them, dressed them and gave them sandals, and gave them food and
drink, and anointed them, and let all the weak ones ride on donkeys, and
brought them to their brothers at Yeriḥo, the city of palm trees, then
returned to Shomeron. 
2Chron
28:16  At that time Sovereign Aḥaz
sent to the sovereigns of Ashshur to help him. 
2Chron
28:17  For the Eḏomites had come
again, and smote Yehuḏah, and took away captives. 
2Chron
28:18  And the Philistines invaded the
cities of the low country and of the South of Yehuḏah, and captured Bĕyth
Shemesh, and Ayalon, and Geḏĕroth, and Soḵo with its villages,
and Timnah with its villages, and Gimzo with its villages, and dwelt there. 
2Chron
28:19  For יהוה
had brought Yehuḏah low because of Aḥaz sovereign of Yisra’ĕl,
for he brought about a lack of restraint in Yehuḏah and trespassed
against יהוה. 
2Chron
28:20  And Tiglath-Pileser the sovereign
of Ashshur came against him and distressed him, and did not help him, 
2Chron
28:21  though Aḥaz had taken some
of the treasures from the House of יהוה, from the house
of the sovereign, and from the leaders, and he gave it to the sovereign of
Ashshur, but he did not help him. 
2Chron
28:22  And in the time of his distress
Sovereign Aḥaz trespassed even more against יהוה –
this Sovereign Aḥaz – 
2Chron
28:23  and he slaughtered to the mighty
ones of Darmeseq, those smiting him, saying, “Because the mighty ones of the
sovereigns of Aram help them, I offer to them and they help me.” But they were
to cause him and all Yisra’ĕl to stumble. 
2Chron
28:24  And Aḥaz gathered the
utensils of the House of Elohim, and cut in pieces the utensils of the House of
Elohim, and shut the doors of the House of יהוה, and
made for himself altars in every corner of Yerushalayim. 
2Chron
28:25  And in every city, even the cities
of Yehuḏah, he made high places to burn incense to other mighty ones, and
provoked יהוה Elohim of his fathers. 
2Chron
28:26  And the rest of his acts and all
his ways, from first to last, see, they are written in the book of the
sovereigns of Yehuḏah and Yisra’ĕl. 
2Chron
28:27  So Aḥaz slept with his
fathers, and they buried him in the city, in Yerushalayim, but they did not
bring him into the tombs of the sovereigns of Yisra’ĕl. And Ḥizqiyahu
his son reigned in his place. 
2Chron
29:1  Ḥizqiyahu began to reign when
he was twenty-five years old, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Yerushalayim.
And his mother’s name was Aḇiyah the daughter of Zeḵaryahu. 
2Chron
29:2  And he did what was right in the
eyes of יהוה, according to all that his father Dawiḏ
did. 
2Chron
29:3  In the first year of his reign, in
the first month, he opened the doors of the House of יהוה
and repaired them, 
2Chron
29:4  and brought in the priests and the
Lĕwites, and gathered them in the open place to the east. 
2Chron
29:5  And he said to them, “Listen to me,
O Lĕwites! Now set yourselves apart, set apart the House of יהוה
Elohim of your fathers, and remove the uncleanness from the set-apart place. 
2Chron
29:6  “For our fathers have trespassed
and have done evil in the eyes of יהוה our Elohim, and
have forsaken Him, and have turned their faces away from the Dwelling Place of יהוה,
and have given their backs. 
2Chron
29:7  “And they have shut the doors of
the porch, and put out the lamps, and they have not burned incense or offered
burnt offerings in the set-apart place to the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl. 
2Chron
29:8  “Therefore the wrath of יהוה
fell upon Yehuḏah and Yerushalayim, and He has given them up for a
trembling, for an astonishment, and for a hissing, as you see with your eyes. 
2Chron
29:9  “And see, because of this our
fathers have fallen by the sword. And our sons, and our daughters, and our
wives are in captivity for this. 
2Chron
29:10  “Now it is in my heart to make a
covenant with יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, so that the
heat of His wrath turns away from us. 
2Chron
29:11  “My sons, do not be slack, for יהוה
has chosen you to stand before Him, to serve Him, and to be attendants for Him
and burn incense.” 
2Chron
29:12  And the Lĕwites rose up:
Maḥath son of Amasai and Yo’ĕl son of Azaryahu, of the sons of the
Qehathites; and of the sons of Merari, Qish son of Aḇdi and Azaryahu son
of Yehallel’ĕl; and of the Gĕreshonites, Yo’aḥ son of Zimmah
and Ĕḏen son of Yo’aḥ; 
2Chron
29:13  and of the sons of Elitsaphan,
Shimri and Ye‛i’ĕl; and of the sons of Asaph, Zeḵaryahu and
Mattanyahu; 
2Chron
29:14  and of the sons of Hĕman,
Yeḥi’ĕl and Shim‛i; and of the sons of Yeḏuthun,
Shemayah and Uzzi’ĕl. 
2Chron
29:15  And they gathered their brothers,
and set themselves apart, and went according to the command of the sovereign,
at the words of יהוה, to cleanse the House of יהוה.

2Chron
29:16  And the priests came into the
inner part of the House of יהוה to cleanse it, and
brought out all the uncleanness they found in the Hĕḵal of יהוה
to the courtyard of the House of יהוה. Then the Lĕwites
received it to take it outside to the wadi Qiḏron. 
2Chron
29:17  And they began to set apart on the
first day of the first month, and on the eighth day of the month they came to
the porch of יהוה. And they set apart the House of יהוה
in eight days, and on the sixteenth day of the first month they had finished. 
2Chron
29:18  Then they came in to Sovereign Ḥizqiyahu
and said, “We have cleansed all the House of יהוה, and
the altar of burnt offerings with all its utensils, and the table of the
showbread with all its utensils. 
2Chron
29:19  “And all the utensils which
Sovereign Aḥaz in his reign had pushed aside, when he trespassed, we have
prepared and set apart. And see, they are before the altar of יהוה.”

2Chron
29:20  And Sovereign Ḥizqiyahu rose
up early, and gathered the heads of the city, and went up to the House of יהוה.

2Chron
29:21  And they brought seven bulls, and
seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven male goats for a sin offering for the
reign, for the set-apart place, and for Yehuḏah. And he said to the
priests, the sons of Aharon, to offer them on the altar of יהוה.

2Chron
29:22  So they slaughtered the bulls, and
the priests received the blood and sprinkled it on the altar. And they
slaughtered the rams and sprinkled the blood on the altar. And they slaughtered
the lambs and sprinkled the blood on the altar. 
2Chron
29:23  And they brought out the male
goats of the sin offering before the sovereign and the assembly, and they laid
their hands on them, 
2Chron
29:24  and the priests slaughtered them,
and with their blood made a sin offering on the altar, to make an atonement for
all Yisra’ĕl, for the sovereign said that the burnt offering and the sin
offering is for all Yisra’ĕl. 
2Chron
29:25  And he appointed the Lĕwites
in the House of יהוה with cymbals, with harps, and with
lyres, according to the command of Dawiḏ, and of Gaḏ, seer of the
sovereign, and of Nathan the prophet, for the command was by the hand of יהוה,
by the hand of His prophets. 
2Chron
29:26  And the Lĕwites stood with
the instruments of Dawiḏ, and the priests with the trumpets. 
2Chron
29:27  And Ḥizqiyahu gave the order
to offer the burnt offering on the altar. And when the burnt offering began,
the singing unto יהוה began, with the trumpets and with
the instruments of Dawiḏ sovereign of Yisra’ĕl. 
2Chron
29:28  And all the assembly were bowing,
and the singers singing, and the trumpeters blowing – all this until the burnt
offering was completed. 
2Chron
29:29  And at the completion of the
offering, the sovereign and all who were present with him bowed and worshipped.

2Chron
29:30  And Sovereign Ḥizqiyahu and
the rulers ordered the Lĕwites to sing praise to יהוה
with the words of Dawiḏ and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with
gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshipped. 
2Chron
29:31  And Ḥizqiyahu responded and
said, “Now that you have ordained yourselves to יהוה,
come near, and bring slaughterings and thank offerings into the House of יהוה.”
And the assembly brought in slaughterings and thank offerings, and all those
whose hearts were so moved brought burnt offerings. 
2Chron
29:32  And the number of the burnt
offerings which the assembly brought was seventy bulls, one hundred rams, two
hundred lambs – all these for a burnt offering to יהוה.

2Chron
29:33  And the set-apart gifts were six
hundred bulls and three thousand sheep. 
2Chron
29:34  Only, the priests were too few,
and were unable to skin all the burnt offerings, so their brothers the Lĕwites
helped them until the work was completed and until the other priests had set
themselves apart, for the Lĕwites were more upright of heart to set
themselves apart, than the priests. 
2Chron
29:35  And there were also many burnt
offerings, with the fat of the peace offerings and with the drink offerings for
every burnt offering. Thus the service of the House of יהוה
was re-established. 
2Chron
29:36  And Ḥizqiyahu and all the
people rejoiced that Elohim had prepared the people, because the matter came
about so suddenly. 
2Chron
30:1  And Ḥizqiyahu sent to all
Yisra’ĕl and Yehuḏah, and he also wrote letters to Ephrayim and
Menashsheh, to come to the House of יהוה at
Yerushalayim, to perform the Passover to יהוה Elohim of
Yisra’ĕl. 
2Chron
30:2  But the sovereign and his leaders
and all the assembly in Yerushalayim had taken counsel to perform the Passover
in the second month. 
2Chron
30:3  For they were unable to perform it
at its time, because not enough priests had set themselves apart, and the
people had not gathered at Yerushalayim. 
2Chron
30:4  And the matter was right in the
eyes of the sovereign and in the eyes of all the assembly. 
2Chron
30:5  And they settled the matter, to
send a call to all Yisra’ĕl, from Be’ĕrsheḇa to Dan, to come to
perform a Passover to יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl at
Yerushalayim, since they had not done it for a long time, as it is written. 
2Chron
30:6  And the runners went to all Yisra’ĕl
and Yehuḏah with the letters from the sovereign and his leaders, and
spoke according to the command of the sovereign, “Children of Yisra’ĕl,
turn back to יהוה Elohim of Aḇraham,
Yitsḥaq, and Yisra’ĕl, so that He returns to the remnant of you who
have escaped from the hand of the sovereigns of Ashshur. 
2Chron
30:7  “And do not be like your fathers
and like your brothers, who trespassed against יהוה
Elohim of their fathers, so that He gave them up to ruin, as you see. 
2Chron
30:8  “Now do not stiffen your neck, like
your fathers, stretch forth the hand to יהוה, and come
to His set-apart place, which He has set apart forever, and serve יהוה
your Elohim, so that His burning wrath turns away from you. 
2Chron
30:9  “For if you turn back to יהוה,
your brothers and your children shall be shown compassion by their captors,
even to return to this land. For יהוה your Elohim shows
favour and compassion, and does not turn His face from you if you turn back to
Him.” 
2Chron
30:10  And the runners passed from city
to city throughout the land of Ephrayim and Menashsheh, as far as Zeḇulun.
But they were laughing at them and mocking them. 
2Chron
30:11  Some from Ashĕr and
Menashsheh and from Zeḇulun, however, humbled themselves and came to
Yerushalayim. 
2Chron
30:12  Also the hand of Elohim was on
Yehuḏah to give them one heart to do the command of the sovereign and the
rulers, at the word of יהוה. 
2Chron
30:13  And many people, a very great assembly,
gathered at Yerushalayim to perform the Festival of Unleavened Bread in the
second month. 
2Chron
30:14  And they rose up and removed the
altars that were in Yerushalayim, and they removed all the incense altars and
threw them into the wadi Qiḏron. 
2Chron
30:15  Then they slaughtered the Passover
on the fourteenth day of the second month. And the priests and the Lĕwites
were ashamed, and set themselves apart, and brought the burnt offerings to the
House of יהוה. 
2Chron
30:16  And they stood in their place
according to their right-ruling. According to the Torah of Mosheh, the man of
Elohim, the priests sprinkled the blood from the hand of the Lĕwites. 
2Chron
30:17  For many in the assembly had not
set themselves apart. Therefore the Lĕwites were over the slaughter of the
Passover for everyone who was not clean, to set them apart to יהוה.

2Chron
30:18  For many of the people, many from
Ephrayim and Menashsheh, Yissasḵar and Zeḇulun, had not been
cleansed, yet they ate the Passover contrary to what was written. But Ḥizqiyahu
prayed for them, saying, “ יהוה who is good, provide
atonement for everyone  
2Chron
30:19  who has prepared his heart to seek
Elohim, יהוה Elohim of his fathers, though he is not
cleansed according to the cleansing of the set-apart place.” 
2Chron
30:20  And יהוה
listened to Ḥizqiyahu and healed the people. 
2Chron
30:21  And the children of Yisra’ĕl
who were in Yerushalayim performed the Festival of Unleavened Bread seven days
with great joy. And the Lĕwites and the priests praised יהוה
day by day, with instruments of praise before יהוה. 
2Chron
30:22  And Ḥizqiyahu spoke to the
heart of all the Lĕwites, those having good understanding concerning יהוה.
So they ate what was appointed, seven days, slaughtering peace offerings and making
confession to יהוה Elohim of their fathers. 
2Chron
30:23  And all the assembly took counsel
to perform another seven days, and they performed it another seven days with
joy. 
2Chron
30:24  For Ḥizqiyahu sovereign of
Yehuḏah presented to the assembly a thousand bulls and seven thousand
sheep, and the rulers presented to the assembly a thousand bulls and ten
thousand sheep. And a great number of priests set themselves apart. 
2Chron
30:25  And all the assembly of Yehuḏah
rejoiced, and the priests and Lĕwites, and all the assembly who had come
from Yisra’ĕl, and the sojourners who came from the land of Yisra’ĕl,
and those who dwelt in Yehuḏah. 
2Chron
30:26  And there came to be great joy in
Yerushalayim, for since the days of Shelomoh son of Dawiḏ, the sovereign
of Yisra’ĕl, the like of this had not been in Yerushalayim. 
2Chron
30:27  And the priests, the Lĕwites,
rose and blessed the people, and their voice was heard. And their prayer came
up to His set-apart dwelling place, to heaven. 
2Chron
31:1  And at the completion of all this,
all Yisra’ĕl who were present went out to the cities of Yehuḏah and
broke down the pillars, and cut down the Ashĕrim, and tore down the high
places and the altars, from all Yehuḏah, and Binyamin, and in Ephrayim
and Menashsheh, even to completion. Then all the children of Yisra’ĕl
returned to their own cities, each to his possession. 
2Chron
31:2  And Ḥizqiyahu appointed the
divisions of the priests and of the Lĕwites according to their divisions,
each according to his service of the priests and Lĕwites for burnt
offerings and peace offerings, to serve and to give thanks, and to praise in
the gates of the camp of יהוה.
2Chron
31:3  And the sovereign appointed a portion of his possessions
for the burnt offerings, for the morning and evening burnt offerings, and the
burnt offerings for the Sabbaths and for the New Moons and for the appointed
times, as it is written in the Torah of יהוה. 
2Chron
31:4  And he said to the people, those
who dwelt in Yerushalayim, to give the portion for the priests and the Lĕwites,
so that they are strengthened in the Torah of יהוה. 
2Chron
31:5  And as the word spread, the
children of Yisra’ĕl brought large quantities of the first-fruits of grain
and wine, and oil and honey, and of all the increase of the field. And they
brought in the tithe of all, a large amount. 
2Chron
31:6  And the children of Yisra’ĕl
and Yehuḏah, those who dwelt in the cities of Yehuḏah, brought the
tithe of cattle and sheep. Even the tithe of set-apart gifts which were set
apart to יהוה their Elohim were brought in, and they
gave heaps, heaps. 
2Chron
31:7  In the third month they began to
pile up the heaps, and they finished in the seventh month. 
2Chron
31:8  And Ḥizqiyahu and the leaders
came and saw the heaps, and they blessed יהוה and His
people Yisra’ĕl. 
2Chron
31:9  And Ḥizqiyahu asked the
priests and the Lĕwites about the heaps. 
2Chron
31:10  And Azaryahu the chief priest,
from the house of Tsaḏoq, answered him and said, “Since they began to
bring the offerings into the House of יהוה, we have had
enough to eat and have plenty left, for יהוה has
blessed His people. And this great amount is left over.” 
2Chron
31:11  And Ḥizqiyahu ordered them
to prepare rooms in the House of יהוה, and they
prepared them. 
2Chron
31:12  Then they brought in the
contribution, and the tithes, and the set-apart gifts, trustworthily. And
Konanyahu the Lĕwite was leader over them, and Shim‛i his brother
was the next. 
2Chron
31:13  And Yeḥi’ĕl, and
Azazyahu, and Naḥath, and Asah’ĕl, and Yerimoth, and Yozaḇaḏ,
and Eli’ĕl, and Yismaḵyahu, and Maḥath, and Benayahu were
overseers under the hand of Konanyahu and Shim‛i his brother, by order of
Ḥizqiyahu the sovereign and Azaryahu the ruler of the House of Elohim. 
2Chron
31:14  And Qorĕ son of Yimnah the Lĕwite,
the keeper of the East Gate, was over the voluntary offerings to Elohim, to
distribute the offerings of יהוה and the most set-apart
gifts. 
2Chron
31:15  And under his hand were Ĕḏen,
and Minyamin, and Yĕshua, and Shemayahu, Amaryahu, and Sheḵanyahu,
in the cities of the priests, to distribute trustworthily to their brothers by
divisions, to the great as well as the small. 
2Chron
31:16  Besides those males from three
years old and up who were written in the genealogy, they distributed to
everyone who entered the House of יהוה his daily
portion for the work of his service, by his division, 
2Chron
31:17  and to the priests who were
written in the genealogy according to their father’s house, and to the Lĕwites
from twenty years old upward, by their duties in their divisions, 
2Chron
31:18  and to all listed in the
genealogy, their little ones and their wives, their sons and daughters, all the
company of them. For in their trustworthiness they set themselves apart in
set-apartness. 
2Chron
31:19  And for the sons of Aharon the
priests, who were in the fields of the open land of their cities, in each and
every city, there were men who were called by name to distribute portions to
all the males among the priests and to all who were listed by genealogies among
the Lĕwites. 
2Chron
31:20  And Ḥizqiyahu did this in
all Yehuḏah, and he did what was good and what was right and what was
true before יהוה his Elohim. 
2Chron
31:21  And in every work that he began in
the service of the House of Elohim, in the Torah and in the command, to seek
his Elohim, with all his heart, he did and prospered. 
2Chron
32:1  After these matters and this
trustworthiness, Sanḥĕriḇ sovereign of Ashshur came. And he
entered Yehuḏah and encamped against the cities of defence, and said to
break them open to himself. 
2Chron
32:2  And Ḥizqiyahu saw that
Sanḥĕriḇ had come, and his face set to fight against
Yerushalayim, 
2Chron
32:3  and he took counsel with his rulers
and mighty men to stop the water from the springs which were outside the city.
And they helped him. 
2Chron
32:4  And many people were gathered, and
they stopped all the springs and the stream that ran through the land, saying, “Why
should the sovereigns of Ashshur come and find much water?” 
2Chron
32:5  And he strengthened himself, and
built up all the wall that was broken, and raised it up to the towers, and
outside of it another wall, and strengthened Millo, the City of Dawiḏ,
and made large numbers of weapons and shields. 
2Chron
32:6  And he appointed battle officers
over the people, and gathered them to him in the open space at the city gate,
and spoke to their heart, saying, 
2Chron
32:7  “Be strong and courageous, do not
be afraid nor be cast down before the sovereign of Ashshur, nor before all the
army that is with him. For with us there are more than with him. 
2Chron
32:8  “With him is an arm of flesh, but
with us is יהוה our Elohim, to help us and to fight our
battles.” And the people leaned on the words of Ḥizqiyahu sovereign of
Yehuḏah. 
2Chron
32:9  After this Sanḥĕriḇ
the sovereign of Ashshur sent his servants to Yerushalayim – but he himself,
and all his power with him against Laḵish – to Ḥizqiyahu sovereign
of Yehuḏah, and to all Yehuḏah who were in Yerushalayim, saying, 
2Chron
32:10  “Thus said Sanḥĕriḇ
the sovereign of Ashshur, ‘On what are you trusting, that you remain in
Yerushalayim under siege? 
2Chron
32:11  ‘Is Ḥizqiyahu not persuading
you to give yourselves over to die by scarcity of food and by thirst, saying, “
יהוה our Elohim shall deliver us from the hand of the
sovereign of Ashshur”? 
2Chron
32:12  ‘Has not Ḥizqiyahu himself
taken away His high places and His altars, and ordered Yehuḏah and
Yerushalayim, saying, “Bow yourselves before one altar and burn incense on it”?

2Chron
32:13  ‘Do you not know what I and my
fathers have done to all the peoples of other lands? Were the mighty ones of
the nations of those lands in any way able to deliver their lands out of my hand?

2Chron
32:14  ‘Who was there among all the
mighty ones of those nations that my fathers put under the ban that could
deliver his people from my hand, that your Elohim should be able to deliver you
from my hand? 
2Chron
32:15  ‘And now, do not let Ḥizqiyahu
deceive you or persuade you like this, and do not believe him; for no mighty
one of any nation or reign was able to deliver his people from my hand or the
hand of my fathers – much less your Elohim, to deliver you from my hand!’ ” 
2Chron
32:16  And his servants spoke even more
against יהוה Elohim and against His servant Ḥizqiyahu.

2Chron
32:17  And he wrote letters to reproach יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, and to speak against Him, saying, “As the mighty ones
of the nations of other lands have not delivered their people from my hand, so
the Elohim of Ḥizqiyahu shall not deliver His people from my hand.” 
2Chron
32:18  Then they called out with a loud
voice in the language of Yehuḏah to the people of Yerushalayim who were
on the wall, to frighten them and to trouble them, in order to capture the
city. 
2Chron
32:19  And they spoke against the Elohim
of Yerushalayim, as against the mighty ones of the people of the earth, the
work of men’s hands. 
2Chron
32:20  And Sovereign Ḥizqiyahu and
the prophet Yeshayahu, son of Amots, prayed about this, and cried out to the
heavens. 
2Chron
32:21  And יהוה
sent a messenger who cut down every mighty brave one, both the leader and the
commander in the camp of the sovereign of Ashshur, and he returned shamefaced
to his own land, and went into the house of his mighty one, and there some of
his own offspring caused him to fall by the sword. 
2Chron
32:22  Thus יהוה
saved Ḥizqiyahu and the inhabitants of Yerushalayim from the hand of
Sanḥĕriḇ the sovereign of Ashshur, and from the hand of all
others, and guided them on every side. 
2Chron
32:23  And many brought gifts to יהוה
at Yerushalayim, and presents to Ḥizqiyahu sovereign of Yehuḏah,
and he was exalted in the eyes of all nations thereafter. 
2Chron
32:24  In those days Ḥizqiyahu was
sick and near death, and he prayed to יהוה. And He
spoke to him and appointed a sign for him. 
2Chron
32:25  However, Ḥizqiyahu did not
repay according to the good done to him, for his heart was lifted up, therefore
wrath came upon him and upon Yehuḏah and Yerushalayim. 
2Chron
32:26  Then Ḥizqiyahu humbled
himself for the pride of his heart, he and the inhabitants of Yerushalayim, so
that the wrath of יהוה did not come upon them in the
days of Ḥizqiyahu. 
2Chron
32:27  And Ḥizqiyahu had much riches
and esteem. And he made himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for
precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all desirable
utensils; 
2Chron
32:28  and storehouses for the harvest of
grain, and wine, and oil, and stalls for all kinds of livestock, and folds for
flocks. 
2Chron
32:29  And he made cities for himself,
and possessions of great numbers of flocks and herds, for Elohim gave him much
property. 
2Chron
32:30  And Ḥizqiyahu himself had
stopped the upper outlet of the waters of Giḥon, and directed them to the
west side of the City of Dawiḏ. And Ḥizqiyahu prospered in all his
work. 
2Chron
32:31  However with the envoys of the
princes of Baḇel, whom they sent to ask him about the wonder that was
done in the land, Elohim left him, in order to try him, to know all that was in
his heart. 
2Chron
32:32  And the rest of the acts of Ḥizqiyahu,
and his kindness, see, they are written in the vision of Yeshayahu the prophet,
son of Amots, in the book of the sovereigns of Yehuḏah and Yisra’ĕl.
2Chron
32:33  So Ḥizqiyahu slept with his
fathers, and they buried him in the upper tombs of the sons of Dawiḏ. And
all Yehuḏah and the inhabitants of Yerushalayim esteemed him at his
death. And Menashsheh his son reigned in his place. 
2Chron
33:1  Menashsheh was twelve years old
when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty-five years in Yerushalayim. 
2Chron
33:2  But he did evil in the eyes of יהוה,
according to the abominations of the gentiles whom יהוה
dispossessed from before the children of Yisra’ĕl. 
2Chron
33:3  For again he rebuilt the high
places which Ḥizqiyahu his father had broken down, and raised up altars
for the Ba‛als, and made Ashĕrim, and bowed himself to all the host
of the heavens and served them. 
2Chron
33:4  And he built altars in the House of
יהוה, of which יהוה had said, “In
Yerushalayim is My Name, forever.” 
2Chron
33:5  And he built altars for all the
host of the heavens in the two courtyards of the House of יהוה.

2Chron
33:6  And he made his sons pass through
the fire in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, and practised magic, and used
divination and witchcraft, and consulted mediums and spiritists. He did much
evil in the eyes of יהוה, to provoke Him. 
2Chron
33:7  And he placed a carved image of the
idol which he had made, in the House of Elohim, of which Elohim had said to
Dawiḏ and to Shelomoh his son, “In this house and in Yerushalayim, which
I have chosen out of all the tribes of Yisra’ĕl, I put My Name forever, 
2Chron
33:8  and no more shall I remove the foot
of Yisra’ĕl from the soil which I have appointed for your fathers – only
if they guard to do all that I have commanded them, according to all the Torah
and the laws and the right-rulings by the hand of Mosheh.” 
2Chron
33:9  Thus Menashsheh led Yehuḏah
and the inhabitants of Yerushalayim astray, to do more evil than the gentiles
whom יהוה had destroyed before the children of Yisra’ĕl.

2Chron
33:10  And יהוה
spoke to Menashsheh and to his people, but they did not listen. 
2Chron
33:11  Therefore יהוה
brought upon them the commanders of the army of the sovereign of Ashshur, who
captured Menashsheh with hooks, bound him with bronze shackles, and made him go
to Baḇel. 
2Chron
33:12  And when he was in distress, he sought
the face of יהוה his Elohim, and humbled himself
greatly before the Elohim of his fathers, 
2Chron
33:13  and prayed to Him. And He was
moved by his entreaty and heard his supplication, and brought him back to
Yerushalayim into his reign. And Menashsheh knew that יהוה
was Elohim. 
2Chron
33:14  And after this he built a wall
outside the City of Dawiḏ on the west of Giḥon, in the wadi, and as
far as the entrance of the Fish Gate, and it went round Ophel, and he made it
exceedingly high. And he put army commanders in all the walled cities of Yehuḏah.

2Chron
33:15  And he removed the foreign mighty
ones and the idol from the House of יהוה, and all the
altars that he had built in the mount of the House of יהוה
and in Yerushalayim, and he threw them out of the city. 
2Chron
33:16  And he built the altar of יהוה,
and brought peace offerings and thank offerings on it, and ordered Yehuḏah
to serve יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl. 
2Chron
33:17  But the people were still offering
on the high places, though only to יהוה their Elohim. 
2Chron
33:18  And the rest of the acts of
Menashsheh, his prayer to his Elohim, and the words of the seers who spoke to
him in the Name of יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, see,
they are written in the book of the sovereigns of Yisra’ĕl.
2Chron
33:19  And his prayer, and his entreaty,
and all his sin, and his trespass, and the places where he built high places
and set up the Ashĕrim and the carved images, before he was humbled, see,
they are written among the words of the seers. 
2Chron
33:20  So Menashsheh slept with his
fathers, and they buried him in his own house. And his son Amon reigned in his
place. 
2Chron
33:21  Amon was twenty-two years old when
he began to reign, and he reigned two years in Yerushalayim. 
2Chron
33:22  But he did evil in the eyes of יהוה,
as his father Menashsheh had done. And Amon offered to all the carved images
which his father Menashsheh had made, and served them. 
2Chron
33:23  And he did not humble himself
before יהוה, as his father Menashsheh had humbled
himself, for Amon trespassed more and more. 
2Chron
33:24  And his servants conspired against
him, and killed him in his own house. 
2Chron
33:25  But the people of the land smote
all those who had conspired against Sovereign Amon, and the people of the land
set up his son Yoshiyahu to reign in his place. 
2Chron
34:1  Yoshiyahu was eight years old when
he began to reign, and he reigned thirty-one years in Yerushalayim. 
2Chron
34:2  And he did what was right in the
eyes of יהוה, and walked in the ways of his father Dawiḏ,
and did not turn aside, right or left. 
2Chron
34:3  And in the eighth year of his
reign, while he was still young, he began to seek the Elohim of his father Dawiḏ.
And in the twelfth year he began to cleanse Yehuḏah and Yerushalayim from
the high places, and the Ashĕrim, and the carved images, and the moulded
images. 
2Chron
34:4  And they broke down the altars of
the Ba‛als in his presence, and the sun-pillars which were above them he
cut down. And the Ashĕrim, and the carved images, and the moulded images
he smashed, and ground them up and strewed it on the graves of those who had
offered to them. 
2Chron
34:5  And he burned the bones of the
priests on their altars, and cleansed Yehuḏah and Yerushalayim, 
2Chron
34:6  and in the cities of Menashsheh,
and Ephrayim, and Shim‛on, as far as Naphtali, in their ruins all around.

2Chron
34:7  And he broke down the altars and
the Ashĕrim, and ground the carved images into dust, and cut down all the
sun-pillars throughout all the land of Yisra’ĕl, and returned to
Yerushalayim. 
2Chron
34:8  And in the eighteenth year of his
reign, when he had cleansed the land and the House, he sent Shaphan son of
Atsalyahu, and Ma‛asĕyahu the head of the city, and Yo’aḥ son
of Yo’aḥaz the recorder, to repair the House of יהוה
his Elohim. 
2Chron
34:9  And they went to Ḥilqiyahu
the high priest, and they gave the silver that was brought into the House of
Elohim, which the Lĕwites who kept the doors had gathered from the hand of
Menashsheh and Ephrayim, and from all the remnant of Yisra’ĕl, and from
all Yehuḏah and Binyamin, and which they had brought back to
Yerushalayim, 
2Chron
34:10  and they gave it in the hand of
the workmen, those appointed over the House of יהוה.
And they gave it to the workmen who worked in the House of יהוה,
to repair and strengthen the house. 
2Chron
34:11  And they gave it to the craftsmen
and to the builders, to buy hewn stone and timber for couplings and for beams
for the houses which the sovereigns of Yehuḏah had destroyed. 
2Chron
34:12  And the men did the work
trustworthily. And over them were appointed Yaḥath and Oḇaḏyahu
the Lĕwites, of the sons of Merari, and Zeḵaryah and Meshullam, of
the sons of the Qehathites, to oversee; and of the Lĕwites, all of whom
were skilled in instruments of song, 
2Chron
34:13  and over the burden bearers, and
overseers of all who did work in any kind of service. And of the Lĕwites
were scribes, and officers, and gatekeepers. 
2Chron
34:14  And when they brought out the
silver that was brought into the House of יהוה, Ḥilqiyahu
the priest found the Book of the Torah of יהוה given by
Mosheh. 
2Chron
34:15  Then Ḥilqiyahu responded and
said to Shaphan the scribe, “I have found the Book of the Torah in the House of
יהוה.” And Ḥilqiyahu gave the book to Shaphan. 
2Chron
34:16  And Shaphan brought the book to
the sovereign, and brought the sovereign word, saying, “All that has been given
into the hand of your servants, they are doing. 
2Chron
34:17  “And they have poured out the
silver that was found in the House of יהוה, and have
given it into the hand of those appointed and the workmen.” 
2Chron
34:18  And Shaphan the scribe informed
the sovereign, saying, “Ḥilqiyahu the priest has given me a book.” And
Shaphan read it before the sovereign. 
2Chron
34:19  And it came to be, when the
sovereign heard the words of the Torah, that he tore his garments. 
2Chron
34:20  And the sovereign commanded Ḥilqiyahu,
Aḥiqam son of Shaphan, and Aḇdon son of Miḵah, and Shaphan
the scribe, and Asayah a servant of the sovereign, saying, 
2Chron
34:21  “Go, inquire of יהוה
for me, and for him who is left in Yisra’ĕl and in Yehuḏah,
concerning the words of the book that is found. For great is the wrath of יהוה
that is poured out on us, because our fathers have not guarded the Word of יהוה,
to do according to all that is written in this book.” 
2Chron
34:22  Then Ḥilqiyahu and those of
the sovereign went to Ḥuldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum son of
Toqhath, son of Ḥasrah, keeper of the wardrobe, who was dwelling in
Yerushalayim in the Second Quarter. And they spoke to her about this. 
2Chron
34:23  And she said to them, “Thus said יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, ‘Say to the man who sent you to Me, 
2Chron
34:24  “Thus said יהוה,
‘See, I am bringing evil on this place and on its inhabitants, all the curses
that are written in the book which they have read before the sovereign of Yehuḏah,

2Chron
34:25  because they have forsaken Me and
burned incense to other mighty ones, to provoke Me with all the works of their
hands. Therefore My wrath is poured out on this place, and is not quenched.’ ” ’

2Chron
34:26  “And to the sovereign of Yehuḏah,
who sent you to inquire of יהוה, say this to him, ‘Thus
said יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, whose words you have
heard, 
2Chron
34:27  “Because your heart was tender,
and you humbled yourself before Elohim when you heard His words against this
place and against its inhabitants, and you humbled yourself before Me, and you
tore your garments and wept before Me, I also have heard,” declares יהוה.

2Chron
34:28  “See, I am gathering you to your
fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace, so that your eyes
would not see all the evil that I am bringing on this place and its
inhabitants.” ’ ” So they brought back word to the sovereign.
2Chron
34:29  And the sovereign sent and
gathered all the elders of Yehuḏah and Yerushalayim. 
2Chron
34:30  And the sovereign went up to the
House of יהוה with all the men of Yehuḏah and the
inhabitants of Yerushalayim, and the priests and the Lĕwites, and all the
people, both great and small. And he read in their hearing all the words of the
Book of the Covenant which had been found in the House of יהוה.

2Chron
34:31  And the sovereign stood in his
place and made a covenant before יהוה, to follow יהוה
and to guard His commands and His witnesses and His laws, with all his heart
and all his being, to do the words of the covenant that were written in this
book. 
2Chron
34:32  And he made stand all who were
present in Yerushalayim and Binyamin. And the inhabitants of Yerushalayim did
according to the covenant of Elohim, the Elohim of their fathers.
2Chron
34:33  And Yoshiyahu removed all the
abominations from all the lands that belonged to the children of Yisra’ĕl,
and made all who were present in Yisra’ĕl diligently serve יהוה
their Elohim. All his days they did not turn away from following יהוה
Elohim of their fathers. 
2Chron
35:1  And Yoshiyahu performed a Passover
to יהוה in Yerushalayim, and they slaughtered the
Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month. 
2Chron
35:2  And he set the priests in their
duties and strengthened them for the service of the House of יהוה,

2Chron
35:3  and said to the Lĕwites who
were teaching all Yisra’ĕl, who were set-apart to יהוה,
“Put the set-apart ark in the house which Shelomoh son of Dawiḏ,
sovereign of Yisra’ĕl, built. It is no longer to be a burden on your
shoulders. Now serve יהוה your Elohim and His people
Yisra’ĕl, 
2Chron
35:4  and prepare by the fathers’ houses,
according to your divisions, by the writing of Dawiḏ sovereign of Yisra’ĕl
and by the writing of Shelomoh his son. 
2Chron
35:5  “And stand in the set-apart place
by the divisions of the fathers’ houses of your brothers the lay people, and
the portion of the father’s house of the Lĕwites. 
2Chron
35:6  “And slaughter the Passover, and
set yourselves apart, and prepare for your brothers, to do according to the
word of יהוה by the hand of Mosheh.” 
2Chron
35:7  And Yoshiyahu gave the lay people
lambs and young goats from the flock, all for Passover offerings for everyone present, to the number of thirty thousand,
and three thousand cattle – these were from the sovereign’s possessions. 
2Chron
35:8  And his leaders contributed a
voluntary offering to the people, to the priests, and to the Lĕwites. Ḥilqiyah,
and Zeḵaryahu, and Yeḥi’ĕl, leaders of the House of Elohim,
gave to the priests for the Passover offerings
two thousand six hundred, and three hundred cattle; 
2Chron
35:9  and Konanyahu, his brothers
Shemayahu and Nethanĕ’l, and Ḥashaḇyahu and Ye‛i’ĕl
and Yozaḇaḏ, chiefs of the Lĕwites, gave to the Lĕwites
for Passover offerings five thousand, and five hundred cattle. 
2Chron
35:10  And the service was prepared, and
the priests stood in their places, and the Lĕwites in their divisions,
according to the command of the sovereign, 
2Chron
35:11  and they slaughtered the Passover.
And the priests sprinkled out of their hands, while the Lĕwites were
skinning.
2Chron
35:12  And they removed the burnt
offerings, to give them to the divisions of the fathers’ houses of the lay people,
to bring to יהוה, as it is written in the Book of
Mosheh, and the same with the cattle. 
2Chron
35:13  So they roasted the Passover offerings with fire according to the
right-ruling, and they boiled the set-apart offerings in pots, and in
cauldrons, and in bowls, and brought them speedily to all the lay people. 
2Chron
35:14  And afterward they prepared for
themselves and for the priests, because the priests, the sons of Aharon, were
offering burnt offerings and fat until night. So the Lĕwites prepared for
themselves and for the priests, the sons of Aharon. 
2Chron
35:15  And the singers, the sons of
Asaph, were in their places, according to the command of Dawiḏ, and
Asaph, and Hĕman, and Yeḏuthun the seer of the sovereign. And the
gatekeepers at each gate did not have to leave their position, because their
brothers the Lĕwites prepared for them. 
2Chron
35:16  And all the service of יהוה
was prepared that day, to perform the Passover and to offer burnt offerings on
the altar of יהוה, according to the command of
Sovereign Yoshiyahu.
2Chron
35:17  And the children of Yisra’ĕl
who were present performed the Passover at that time, and the Festival of
Unleavened Bread for seven days. 
2Chron
35:18  There had not been a Passover
performed in Yisra’ĕl like it since the days of Shemu’ĕl the prophet.
And none of the sovereigns of Yisra’ĕl had performed such a Passover as
Yoshiyahu performed, with the priests and the Lĕwites, and all Yehuḏah
and Yisra’ĕl who were present, and the inhabitants of Yerushalayim. 
2Chron
35:19  In the eighteenth year of the
reign of Yoshiyahu this Passover was performed. 
2Chron
35:20  After all this, when Yoshiyahu had
prepared the House, Neḵo sovereign of Mitsrayim came up to fight against
Karkemish by the Euphrates. And Yoshiyahu went out against him. 
2Chron
35:21  And he sent messengers to him,
saying, “What have I to do with you, sovereign of Yehuḏah? I am not
coming against you this day, but against the house with which I am fighting,
for Elohim commanded me to make haste. Leave Elohim alone, who is with me, lest
He destroy you.” 
2Chron
35:22  However, Yoshiyahu would not turn
his face from him, but disguised himself to fight against him, and did not
listen to the words of Neḵo from the mouth of Elohim, and came to fight
in the Valley of Meḡiddo. 
2Chron
35:23  And the archers shot at Sovereign
Yoshiyahu. And the sovereign said to his servants, “Take me away, for I am
severely wounded.” 
2Chron
35:24  And his servants took him out of
that chariot and put him in the second chariot that he had, and they brought
him to Yerushalayim. And he died, and was buried in one of the tombs of his
fathers. And all Yehuḏah and Yerushalayim were mourning for Yoshiyahu. 
2Chron
35:25  And Yirmeyahu lamented for
Yoshiyahu. And to this day all the singing men and the singing women speak of
Yoshiyahu in their lamentations, and made it a law in Yisra’ĕl. And see,
they are written in the Laments. 
2Chron
35:26  And the rest of the acts of
Yoshiyahu and his kindness, according to what was written in the Torah of יהוה,

2Chron
35:27  and his acts from the first to the
last, see, they are written in the book of the sovereigns of Yisra’ĕl and
Yehuḏah. 
2Chron
36:1  And the people of the land took
Yeho’aḥaz son of Yoshiyahu, and set him up to reign in his father’s place
in Yerushalayim. 
2Chron
36:2  Yeho’aḥaz was twenty-three
years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in Yerushalayim. 
2Chron
36:3  And the sovereign of Mitsrayim
turned him aside in Yerushalayim, and imposed on the land a levy of one hundred
talents of silver and a talent of gold. 
2Chron
36:4  And the sovereign of Mitsrayim made
his brother Elyaqim sovereign over Yehuḏah and Yerushalayim, and changed
his name to Yehoyaqim. And Neḵo took Yeho’aḥaz his brother and
brought him to Mitsrayim. 
2Chron
36:5  Yehoyaqim was twenty-five years old
when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Yerushalayim. And he did
evil in the eyes of יהוה his Elohim. 
2Chron
36:6  Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar
sovereign of Baḇel came up against him, and bound him in bronze shackles
to take him away to Baḇel. 
2Chron
36:7  And Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar
brought some of the utensils from the House of יהוה to
Baḇel, and put them in his hĕḵal at Baḇel. 
2Chron
36:8  And the rest of the acts of
Yehoyaqim, the abominations which he did, and what was found against him, see,
they are written in the book of the sovereigns of Yisra’ĕl and Yehuḏah.
Then Yehoyaḵin his son reigned in his place. 
2Chron
36:9  Yehoyaḵin was eight years old
when he began to reign, and he reigned in Yerushalayim three months and ten
days. And he did evil in the eyes of יהוה. 
2Chron
36:10  And at the turn of the year
Sovereign Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar sent and brought him to Baḇel,
with the valuable utensils from the House of יהוה, and
made Tsiḏqiyahu, Yehoyaqim’s brother, sovereign over Yehuḏah and
Yerushalayim. 
2Chron
36:11  Tsiḏqiyahu was twenty-one
years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Yerushalayim. 
2Chron
36:12  And he did evil in the eyes of יהוה
his Elohim. He did not humble himself before Yirmeyahu the prophet, who spoke
from the mouth of יהוה. 
2Chron
36:13  And he also rebelled against
Sovereign Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar, who had made him swear by Elohim,
but he stiffened his neck and hardened his heart against turning to יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl. 
2Chron
36:14  Also, all the heads of the priests
and the people trespassed more and more, according to all the abominations of
the gentiles, and they defiled the House of יהוה which
He had set apart in Yerushalayim. 
2Chron
36:15  And יהוה
Elohim of their fathers sent to them, by His messengers, rising up early and
sending them, for He had compassion on His people and on His dwelling place. 
2Chron
36:16  But they were mocking the
messengers of Elohim and despising His words and scoffing at His prophets,
until the wrath of יהוה arose against His people, until
there was no healing. 
2Chron
36:17  Therefore He brought against them
the sovereign of the Chaldeans, and he slew their young men with the sword in
the House of their set-apart place, and had no compassion on young man or
maiden, on the aged or the weak – He gave all into his hand. 
2Chron
36:18  And all the utensils from the
House of Elohim, great and small, and the treasures of the House of יהוה,
and the treasures of the sovereign and of his leaders, all these he brought to
Baḇel. 
2Chron
36:19  And they burned the House of
Elohim, and broke down the wall of Yerushalayim, and burned all its palaces
with fire, and destroyed all its valuable utensils. 
2Chron
36:20  And those who escaped from the
sword he exiled to Baḇel, where they became servants to him and his sons
until the reign of the reign of Persia, 
2Chron
36:21  in order to fill the word of יהוה
by the mouth of Yirmeyahu, until the land had enjoyed her Sabbaths. As long as
she lay waste she kept Sabbath, until seventy years were completed. 
2Chron
36:22  And in the first year of Koresh
sovereign of Persia, in order to accomplish the word of יהוה
by the mouth of Yirmeyahu, יהוה stirred up the spirit
of Koresh sovereign of Persia, so that he called out in all his reign, and also
put it in writing, saying, 
2Chron
36:23  “Thus said Koresh sovereign of
Persia, ‘ יהוה Elohim of the heavens has given me all
the reigns of the earth. And He has commanded me to build Him a house in
Yerushalayim, which is in Yehuḏah. Whoever is among you of all His
people, יהוה his Elohim be with him, and let him go up!’
