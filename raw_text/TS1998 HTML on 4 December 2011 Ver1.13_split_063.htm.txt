Tas`loniqim Aleph/1 Thessalonians
1Thes
1:1  Sha’ul, and Sila, and Timothy, to
the assembly of the Thessalonians in Elohim the Father and the Master יהושע
Messiah: Favour to you and peace from Elohim our Father and the Master יהושע
Messiah. 
1Thes
1:2  We give thanks to Elohim always for
you all, making mention of you in our prayers, 
1Thes
1:3  remembering without ceasing your
work of the belief, and the labour of love, and the endurance of the
expectation in our Master יהושע Messiah in the
presence of our Elohim and Father, 
1Thes
1:4  knowing, brothers beloved by Elohim,
that you were chosen. 
1Thes
1:5  Because our Good News did not come
to you in word only, but also in power, and in the Set-apart Spirit and in
entire confirmation, as you know what kind of men we were among you for your
sake. 
1Thes
1:6  And you became imitators of us and
of the Master, having received the word in much pressure, with joy of the
Set-apart Spirit, 
1Thes
1:7  so that you became an example to all
who believe in Makedonia and Achaia. 
1Thes
1:8  For from you the word of the Master
has sounded forth, not only in Makedonia and Achaia, but also in every place
your belief toward Elohim has gone out, so that it is unnecessary for us to say
whatever. 
1Thes
1:9  For they themselves report what kind
of reception we had with you, and how you turned to Elohim from idols, to serve
the living and true Elohim, 
1Thes
1:10  and to wait for His Son from the
heavens, whom He raised from the dead, יהושע, who
is delivering us from the wrath to come. 
1Thes
2:1  For you yourselves know, brothers,
that our coming to you was not in vain. 
1Thes
2:2  But having suffered before and
having been mistreated at Philippi, as you know, we were bold in our Elohim to
speak to you the Good News of Elohim in much struggle.
1Thes
2:3  For the appeal we make does not come
from delusion, nor from uncleanness, nor from deceit. 
1Thes
2:4  But as we have been approved by
Elohim to be entrusted with the Good News, so we speak, not as pleasing men,
but Elohim who proves our hearts. 
1Thes
2:5  For we never came with a word of
flattery, as you know, nor with a cloak for greed – Elohim is witness – 
1Thes
2:6  nor were we looking for praise from
men, not from you nor from others, though we could have been a burden to you,
as emissaries of Messiah. 
1Thes
2:7  But we were gentle in your midst,
like a nursing mother warmly loving her own children. 
1Thes
2:8  So, having a tender affection for
you, we were well pleased to share with you not only the Good News of Elohim,
but also our own lives, because you have become beloved to us. 
1Thes
2:9  For you remember, brothers, our toil
and hardship, for labouring night and day, in order not to burden any of you,
we proclaimed to you the Good News of Elohim. 
1Thes
2:10  You are witnesses, Elohim also, how
set-apart and righteously and blamelessly we behaved ourselves among you who
believe, 
1Thes
2:11  even as you know how each one of
you, as a father to his children, encouraging and comforting and bearing
witness to you, 
1Thes
2:12  that you would walk worthily of
Elohim who is calling you into His own reign and esteem. 
1Thes
2:13  And because of this we thank Elohim
without ceasing, that when you received the Word of Elohim which you heard from
us, you welcomed it not as the word of men, but as it is truly, the Word of
Elohim, which also works in you who believe.
1Thes
2:14  For you, brothers, became imitators
of the assemblies of Elohim which are in Yehuḏah in Messiah יהושע,
because you also suffered the same treatment
from your own countrymen as they also from the Yehuḏim, 
1Thes
2:15  who killed both the Master יהושע
and their own prophets, and have persecuted us, and who displease Elohim and
are hostile to all men, 
1Thes
2:16  forbidding us to speak to the
gentiles that they might be saved, so as to fill up their sins always. But the
wrath has come upon them to the utmost. 
1Thes
2:17  But we, brothers, having been taken
away from you for a short while – in presence, not in heart – were much more
eagerly trying to see your face, with much longing. 
1Thes
2:18  We would therefore have come to
you, I indeed, Sha’ul, more than once, but Satan hindered us. 
1Thes
2:19  For what is our expectation, or
joy, or crown of boasting? Is it not even you, before our Master יהושע
Messiah at His coming? 
1Thes
2:20  For you are our esteem and joy. 
1Thes
3:1  So, when we could no longer stand
it, we thought it good to be left in Athens alone, 
1Thes
3:2  and sent Timothy, our brother and
servant of Elohim, and our fellow worker in the Good News of Messiah, to
establish you and encourage you concerning your belief, 
1Thes
3:3  that no one should be unsettled by
these pressures, for you yourselves know that we are appointed to this. 
1Thes
3:4  For indeed, we did inform you
beforehand, when we were with, you that we would suffer pressure, and so it
came to be, as you know. 
1Thes
3:5  Because of this, when I could no
longer stand it, I sent to find out about your belief, lest the trying one
might have tried you, and our labour should be in vain. 
1Thes
3:6  But now that Timothy has come to us
from you, and having brought us good news of your belief and love, and that you
always have good remembrance of us, longing to see us, as we also to see you,
1Thes
3:7  therefore, brothers, in all our
pressure and distress we were encouraged concerning you by your belief. 
1Thes
3:8  Because we now live, if you stand
fast in the Master. 
1Thes
3:9  For what thanks are we able to
return to Elohim for you, for all the joy with which we rejoice for your sake
in the presence of our Elohim, 
1Thes
3:10  night and day praying exceedingly,
to see your face and make complete what is lacking in your belief? 
1Thes
3:11  And our Elohim and Father Himself,
and our Master יהושע Messiah, direct our way to
you! 
1Thes
3:12  And the Master make you increase
and overflow in love to each other and to all, as we also do to you, 
1Thes
3:13  to establish your hearts blameless
in set-apartness before our Elohim and Father at the coming of our Master יהושע
Messiah with all His set-apart ones! 
1Thes
4:1  For the rest then, brothers, we beg
you and call upon you in the Master יהושע, that
as you received from us how you should walk and to please Elohim, you should
excel still more, 
1Thes
4:2  for you know what commands we gave
you through the Master יהושע. 
1Thes
4:3  For this is the desire of Elohim:
your set-apartness! – that you should abstain from whoring, 
1Thes
4:4  that each one of you should know how
to possess his own vessel in set-apartness and respect, 
1Thes
4:5  not in passion of lust, like the
gentiles who do not know Elohim, 
1Thes
4:6  not to overstep and take advantage
of his brother in this matter, because the Master is the revenger of all such,
as we indeed said to you before and earnestly warned. 
1Thes
4:7  For Elohim did not call us to
uncleanness, but in set-apartness. 
1Thes
4:8  Therefore he who rejects this does
not reject man, but Elohim, who also gives us His Set-apart Spirit. 
1Thes
4:9  And it is not necessary to write to
you about brotherly love, for you yourselves are taught by Elohim to love one
another,
1Thes
4:10  for, in fact, you do so toward all the
brothers who are in all Makedonia. But we call upon you, brothers, that you do
so more and more, 
1Thes
4:11  and to make it your ambition to
live peaceably, and to attend to your own, and to work with your own hands, as
we commanded you, 
1Thes
4:12  so that you behave decently toward
those who are outside, and not be in any need.
1Thes
4:13  Now, brothers, we do not wish you
to be ignorant concerning those who have fallen asleep, lest you be sad as
others who have no expectation. 
1Thes
4:14  For if we believe that יהושע
died and rose again, so also Elohim shall bring with Him those who sleep in יהושע.
1Thes
4:15  For this we say to you by the word
of the Master, that we, the living who are left over at the coming of the
Master shall in no way go before those who are asleep. 
1Thes
4:16  Because the Master Himself shall
come down from heaven with a shout, with the voice of a chief messenger, and
with the trumpet of Elohim, and the dead in Messiah shall rise first. 
1Thes
4:17  Then we, the living who are left
over, shall be caught away together with them in the clouds to meet the Master
in the air – and so we shall always be with the Master. 
1Thes
4:18  So, then, encourage one another
with these words. 
1Thes
5:1  Now, brothers, as to the times and
the seasons, you do not need to be written to.
1Thes
5:2  For you yourselves know very well
that the day of יהוה comes as a thief in the night. 
1Thes
5:3  For when they say, “Peace and
safety!” then suddenly destruction comes upon them, as labour pains upon a
pregnant woman, and they shall not escape. 
1Thes
5:4  But you, brothers, are not in
darkness, so that this Day should overtake you as a thief. 
1Thes
5:5  For you are all sons of light and
sons of the day. We are not of the night nor of darkness. 
1Thes
5:6  So, then, we should not sleep, as
others do, but we should watch and be sober. 
1Thes
5:7  For those who sleep, sleep at night,
and those who get drunk are drunk at night. 
1Thes
5:8  But we who are of the day should be
sober, putting on the breastplate of belief and love, and as a helmet the
expectation of deliverance. 
1Thes
5:9  Because Elohim did not appoint us to
wrath, but to obtain deliverance through our Master יהושע
Messiah, 
1Thes
5:10  who died for us, so that we,
whether awake or asleep, should live together with Him. 
1Thes
5:11  Therefore encourage one another,
and build up one another, as indeed you do. 
1Thes
5:12  But brothers, we beg you to know
those who labour among you, and are over you in the Master and admonish you, 
1Thes
5:13  and to hold them in the highest
regard in love because of their work. Be at peace among yourselves. 
1Thes
5:14  And we appeal to you, brothers,
warn those who are disorderly, encourage the faint-hearted, uphold the weak, be
patient with all. 
1Thes
5:15  See that no one renders evil for
evil to anyone, but always pursue what is good both for yourselves and for all.

1Thes
5:16  Rejoice always, 
1Thes
5:17  pray without ceasing, 
1Thes
5:18  in all circumstances give thanks, for this is the desire of Elohim in
Messiah יהושע for you. 
1Thes
5:19  Do not quench the Spirit. 
1Thes
5:20  Do not despise prophecies, 
1Thes
5:21  prove them all. Hold fast what is
good. 
1Thes
5:22  Keep back from every form of
wickedness. 
1Thes
5:23  And the Elohim of peace Himself set
you completely apart, and your entire spirit, and being, and body - be
preserved blameless at the coming of our Master יהושע
Messiah! 
1Thes
5:24  He who calls you is trustworthy,
who also shall do it. 
1Thes
5:25  Brothers, pray for us. 
1Thes
5:26  Greet all the brothers with a
set-apart kiss. 
1Thes
5:27  I charge you by the Master that
this letter be read to all the set-apart brothers. 
1Thes
5:28  The favour of our Master יהושע
Messiah be with you. Amĕn.
