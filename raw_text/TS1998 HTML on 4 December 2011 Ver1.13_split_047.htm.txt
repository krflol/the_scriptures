Hag
1:1  In the second year of Dareyawesh the
sovereign, in the sixth month, on the first day of the month, the word of יהוה
came by Ḥaggai the prophet to Zerubbaḇel son of She’alti’ĕl,
governor of Yehuḏah, and to Yehoshua son of Yehotsaḏaq, the high
priest, saying, 
Hag
1:2  “Thus spoke יהוה
of hosts, saying, ‘This people have said, “The time has not come, the time the
House of יהוה is to be built.” ’ ” 
Hag
1:3  Then the word of יהוה
came by Ḥaggai the prophet, saying, 
Hag
1:4  “Is it time for you yourselves to
dwell in your panelled houses, and this House be in ruins?” 
Hag
1:5  And now, thus said יהוה
of hosts, “Consider your ways! 
Hag
1:6  “You have sown much, but brought in
little; eat, but do not have enough; drink, but you are not filled with drink;
clothe yourselves, but no one is warm; and he who earns wages, earns wages to
put into a bag with holes.” 
Hag
1:7  Thus said יהוה
of hosts, “Consider your ways! 
Hag
1:8  Go up to the mountain, and you shall
bring wood and build the House. And I will be pleased with it, and let Me be
esteemed,” said יהוה. 
Hag
1:9  “When you looked for much, then see,
it came to little. And when you brought it home, I would blow on it. Why?”
declares יהוה of hosts. “Because of My House which lies
in ruins, while each of you runs to his own house. 
Hag
1:10  “Therefore the heavens above you
have withheld the dew, and the earth has withheld its fruit. 
Hag
1:11  “And I called for a drought on the
land, and on the mountains, and on the grain, and on the new wine, and on the
oil, and on whatever the ground brings forth, and on man, and on livestock, and
on all the labour of the hands.” 
Hag
1:12  Then Zerubbaḇel son of She’alti’ĕl,
and Yehoshua son of Yehotsaḏaq, the high priest, with all the remnant of
the people, obeyed the voice of יהוה their Elohim, and
the words of Ḥaggai the prophet, as יהוה their
Elohim had sent him. And the people feared the presence of יהוה.

Hag
1:13  And Ḥaggai, the messenger of יהוה,
spoke the message of יהוה to the people, saying, “I am
with you, declares יהוה.” 
Hag
1:14  And יהוה
stirred up the spirit of Zerubbaḇel son of She’alti’ĕl, governor of
Yehuḏah, and the spirit of Yehoshua son of Yehotsaḏaq, the high
priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people. And they came and
worked on the House of יהוה of hosts, their Elohim, 
Hag
1:15  on the twenty-fourth day of the
sixth month, in the second year of Dareyawesh the sovereign. 
Hag
2:1  In the seventh month, on the
twenty-first of the month, the word of יהוה came by Ḥaggai
the prophet, saying, 
Hag
2:2  “Speak, please, to Zerubbaḇel
son of She’alti’ĕl, governor of Yehuḏah, and to Yehoshua son of
Yehotsaḏaq, the high priest, and to the remnant of the people, saying, 
Hag
2:3  ‘Who is there left among you who saw
this House in its former esteem? And how do you see it now? Is it not in your
eyes as naught when compared to it? 
Hag
2:4  ‘And now, be strong, Zerubbaḇel,’
declares יהוה. ‘And be strong, Yehoshua, son of Yehotsaḏaq,
the high priest. And be strong, all you people of the land,’ declares יהוה,
‘and work. For I am with you,’ declares יהוה of hosts –

Hag
2:5  the Word that I covenanted with you
when you came out of Mitsrayim, and My Spirit is remaining in your midst, do not
fear!’
Hag
2:6  “For thus said יהוה
of hosts, ‘Once more, in a little while, and I am shaking the heavens and
earth, the sea and dry land. 
Hag
2:7  ‘And I shall shake all the nations,
and they shall come to the Delight of all the nations, and I shall fill this
House with esteem,’ said יהוה of hosts. 
Hag
2:8  ‘The silver is Mine, and the gold is
Mine,’ declares יהוה of hosts. 
Hag
2:9  ‘Let the esteem of this latter House
be greater than the former,’ said יהוה of hosts. ‘And
in this place I give peace,’ declares יהוה of hosts.” 
Hag
2:10  On the twenty-fourth of the ninth
month, in the second year of Dareyawesh, the word of יהוה
came unto Ḥaggai the prophet, saying, 
Hag
2:11  “Thus said יהוה
of hosts, ‘Now, ask the priests concerning the Torah, saying, 
Hag
2:12  “If one bears set-apart meat in the
fold of his garment, and with the edge he touches bread or stew, or wine or
oil, or any food, is it set-apart?” ’ ” And the priests answered and said, “No.”

Hag
2:13  And Ḥaggai said, “If someone
defiled by a dead body touches any of these, is it defiled?” And the priests
answered and said, “It is defiled.” 
Hag
2:14  And Ḥaggai answered and said,
“ ‘So is this people, and so is this nation before Me,’ declares יהוה,
‘and so is every work of their hands. And whatever they bring near there is
defiled. 
Hag
2:15  ‘But now, please consider, from
this day onward: Before a stone was laid on a stone in the Hĕḵal of יהוה,

Hag
2:16  since those days – one came to a
heap of twenty ĕphahs, and there were ten; one came to the winepress to
draw out fifty baths from the press, and there were twenty – 
Hag
2:17  ‘I smote you with blight and mildew
and hail in all the labours of your hands, and ther2 was none of you with Me,’
declares יהוה. 
Hag
2:18  ‘Consider now from this day
forward, from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, from the day that the
foundation of the Hĕḵal of יהוה was laid,
consider it: 
Hag
2:19  ‘Is the seed yet in the storehouse?
And until now the vine, and the fig tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive
tree have not yielded fruit! From this day on I shall bless you!’ ” 
Hag
2:20  And a second time the word of יהוה
came to Ḥaggai on the twenty-fourth day of the month, saying, 
Hag
2:21  “Speak to Zerubbaḇel, the
governor of Yehuḏah, saying, ‘I am shaking the heavens and earth. 
Hag
2:22  ‘And I shall overturn the throne of
reigns. And I shall destroy the might of the gentile reigns, and overturn the
chariots and their riders. And the horses and their riders shall come down,
each by the sword of his brother.
Hag
2:23  ‘In that day,’ declares יהוה
of hosts, ‘I shall take you, Zerubbaḇel My servant, son of She’alti’ĕl,’
declares יהוה, ‘and shall make you as a signet, for I
have chosen you,’ declares יהוה of hosts.”
