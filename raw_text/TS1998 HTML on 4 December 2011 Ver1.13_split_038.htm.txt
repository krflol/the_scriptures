Hoshĕa/Hosea
Hos
1:1  The word of יהוה
that came to Hoshĕa son of Be’ĕri, in the days of Uzziyah, Yotham,
Aḥaz, and Ḥizqiyah, sovereigns of Yehuḏah, and in the days of
Yaroḇ‛am son of Yo’ash, sovereign of Yisra’ĕl. 
Hos
1:2  The beginning of the word of יהוה
with Hoshĕa. And יהוה said to Hoshĕa, “Go,
take yourself a woman of whoring and children of whoring, for the land has
utterly whored away from יהוה.” 
Hos
1:3  So he went and took Gomer, daughter
of Diḇlayim, and she conceived and bore him a son. 
Hos
1:4  And יהוה
said to him, “Call his name Yizre‛ĕl, for in a little while I shall
revenge the bloodshed of Yizre‛ĕl on the house of Yĕhu, and put
an end to the reign of the house of Yisra’ĕl. 
Hos
1:5  “And it shall be in that day that I
shall break the bow of Yisra’ĕl in the Valley of Yizre‛ĕl.” 
Hos
1:6  And she conceived again and bore a
daughter. And He said to him, “Call her name Lo-Ruḥamah, for no longer do
I have compassion on the house of Yisra’ĕl so as to forgive them at all. 
Hos
1:7  “But I shall have compassion on the
house of Yehuḏah and save them by יהוה their
Elohim, and not save them by bow or by sword or battle, by horses or horsemen.”

Hos
1:8  And she weaned Lo-Ruḥamah, and
conceived and bore a son, 
Hos
1:9  then He said, “Call his name
Lo-Ammi, for you are not My people, and I am not for you. 
Hos
1:10  “Yet the number of the children of
Yisra’ĕl shall be as the sand of the sea, which is not measured nor
counted. And it shall be in the place where it was said to them, ‘You are not
My people,’ they shall be called, ‘You are the sons of the living Ĕl.’
Hos
1:11  “And the children of Yehuḏah
and the children of Yisra’ĕl shall be gathered together, and appoint for
themselves one head, and shall come up out of the earth, for great is the day
of Yizre‛ĕl! 
Hos
2:1  “Say to your brothers, ‘O my people,’
and to your sisters, ‘O, compassioned one.’
Hos
2:2  “Strive with your mother, strive,
for she is not My wife, nor am I her Husband! Let her put away her whorings
from her face, and her adulteries from between her breasts, 
Hos
2:3  lest I strip her naked, and shall
set her up as on the day she was born, and shall make her like a wilderness,
and shall set her like a dry land, and shall put her to death with thirst. 
Hos
2:4  “And I shall not have compassion on
her children, for they are the children of whorings. 
Hos
2:5  “For their mother has whored, she
who conceived them has acted shamelessly. For she said, ‘I go after my lovers,
who give me my bread and my water, my wool and my linen, my oil and my drink.’ 
Hos
2:6  “Therefore, see, I am hedging up
your way with thorns, and I shall wall her in, so that she does not find her
paths. 
Hos
2:7  “And she shall pursue her lovers but
not overtake them, and shall seek them but not find them. Then she shall say, ‘Let
me go and return to my first husband, for then it was better for me than now.’ 
Hos
2:8  “And she did not acknowledge that I
gave her grain, and new wine, and oil, and increased her silver and gold which
they prepared for Ba‛al. 
Hos
2:9  “Therefore I shall turn back and
shall take my grain in its time and My new wine in its season, and I shall take
away My wool and My linen covering her nakedness. 
Hos
2:10  “And now I shall uncover her shame
before the eyes of her lovers, and no one shall deliver her from My hand. 
Hos
2:11  “And I shall cause all her
rejoicing, her festivals, her New Moons, and her Sabbaths, even all her
appointed times, to cease, 
Hos
2:12  and lay waste her vines and her fig
trees, of which she has said, ‘these are my rewards that my lovers have given
me.’ And I shall make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat
them. 
Hos
2:13  “And I shall punish her for the
days of the Ba‛als to which she burned incense and adorned herself with
her rings and jewelry, and went after her lovers, and forgot Me,” declares יהוה.

Hos
2:14  “Therefore, see, I am alluring her,
and shall lead her into the wilderness, and shall speak to her heart, 
Hos
2:15  and give to her vineyards from
there, and the Valley of Aḵor as a door of expectation. And there she
shall respond as in the days of her youth, as in the day when she came up from
the land of Mitsrayim. 
Hos
2:16  “And it shall be, in that day,”
declares יהוה, “that you call Me ‘My Husband,’ and no
longer call Me ‘My Ba‛al.’ 
Hos
2:17  “And I shall remove the names of
the Ba‛als from her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their
name. 
Hos
2:18  “And in that day I shall make a
covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the birds of the
heavens, and with the creeping creatures of the ground, when bow, and sword,
and battle I break from the earth. And I shall make them lie down in safety. 
Hos
2:19  “And I shall take you as a bride
unto Me forever, and take you as a bride unto Me in righteousness, and in
right-ruling, and kindness and compassion. 
Hos
2:20  “And I shall take you as a bride
unto Me in trustworthiness, and you shall know יהוה. 
Hos
2:21  “And it shall be in that day that I
answer,” declares יהוה, “that I answer the heavens, and
they answer the earth, 
Hos
2:22  and the earth answer the grain and
the new wine and the oil, and they answer Yizre‛ĕl. 
Hos
2:23  “And I shall sow her for Myself in
the earth, and I shall have compassion on her who had not obtained compassion.
And I shall say to those who were not My people, ‘You are My people,’ while
they say, ‘My Elohim!’ ” 
Hos
3:1  Then יהוה
said to me, “Go again, love a woman loved by a friend, and an adulteress,
according to the love of יהוה for the children of Yisra’ĕl,
though they are turning to other mighty ones and love their raisin cakes.” 
Hos
3:2  So I bought her for myself for
fifteen pieces of silver, and one and one-half ḥomers of barley. 
Hos
3:3  And I said to her, “You are to
remain with me many days, you are not to whore, nor become any man’s, and so I
shall also be towards you.” 
Hos
3:4  For many days the children of Yisra’ĕl
are to remain without sovereign and without prince, and without slaughtering,
and without pillar, and without shoulder garment or house idols. 
Hos
3:5  Afterward the children of Yisra’ĕl
shall return, and seek יהוה their Elohim, and Dawiḏ
their sovereign, and fear יהוה and His goodness, in the
latter days. 
Hos
4:1  Hear the word of יהוה,
you children of Yisra’ĕl, for יהוה has a case
against the inhabitants of the land: “For there is no truth or kindness or
knowledge of Elohim in the land. 
Hos
4:2  “Swearing, and lying, and murdering,
and stealing, and committing adultery have increased. And bloodshed follows
bloodshed. 
Hos
4:3  “Therefore the land mourns, and
everyone living there languishes, with the beasts of the field and the birds of
the heavens. And the fish of the sea are taken away. 
Hos
4:4  “However, let no one strive or
reprove another, for your people are like those striving with a priest. 
Hos
4:5  “And you shall stumble in the day,
and the prophet shall also stumble with you in the night. And I shall make your
mother perish. 
Hos
4:6  “My people have perished for lack of
knowledge. Because you have rejected knowledge, I reject you from being priest
for Me. Since you have forgotten the Torah of your Elohim, I also forget your
children. 
Hos
4:7  “As they were increased, so they
sinned against Me. My esteem they have changed into shame. 
Hos
4:8  “They eat the sin of My people, and
lift up their desire to their crookedness. 
Hos
4:9  “And it shall be: like people, like
priest. And I shall punish them for their ways, and reward them for their
deeds. 
Hos
4:10  “And they shall eat but not be
satisfied, they shall whore but not increase, for they have stopped obeying יהוה.

Hos
4:11  “Whoring, and wine, and new wine
enslave the heart. 
Hos
4:12  “My people ask from their Wood, and
their Staff declares to them. For a spirit of whorings has led them astray, and
they went whoring from under their Elohim. 
Hos
4:13  “They slaughter on the
mountaintops, and burn incense on the hills, under oak and poplars and
terebinth, because its shade is good. Therefore your daughters commit whoring,
and your brides commit adultery. 
Hos
4:14  “I would not punish your daughters
when they commit whoring, nor your brides when they commit adultery, for the men themselves go aside with whores,
and offer with cult prostitutes – a people that do not understand are thrust
down! 
Hos
4:15  “Though you are a whore, Yisra’ĕl,
let not Yehuḏah become guilty. Do not come up to Gilgal, nor go up to Bĕyth
Awen, nor swear an oath, saying, ‘As יהוה lives!’ 
Hos
4:16  “For Yisra’ĕl is stubborn,
like a stubborn calf. Would יהוה now feed them like a
lamb in a broad place? 
Hos
4:17  “Ephrayim is joined to idols, let
him alone. 
Hos
4:18  “Their drink is sour, they have
whored continually. Her rulers wildly loved shame. 
Hos
4:19  “A wind has bound her up in its
wings, and they are ashamed because of their slaughterings. 
Hos
5:1  “Hear this, O priests! And listen, O
house of Yisra’ĕl! Give ear, O house of the sovereign! For the judgment is
for you, for you have been a snare to Mitspah and a net spread on Taḇor. 
Hos
5:2  “And they have made deep the pit of
Shittim, so I reprove them all. 
Hos
5:3  “I have known Ephrayim, and Yisra’ĕl
has not been hidden from Me. For now, O Ephrayim, you have whored, Yisra’ĕl
is defiled. 
Hos
5:4  “Their deeds do not allow them to
turn back to their Elohim, for the spirit of whorings is among them, and they
do not know יהוה. 
Hos
5:5  “And the Excellency of Yisra’ĕl
shall witness to his face, and Yisra’ĕl and Ephrayim stumble in their
crookedness. Yehuḏah shall also stumble with them. 
Hos
5:6  “With their flocks and herds they go
to seek יהוה, but do not find Him – He has withdrawn
from them. 
Hos
5:7  “They have acted treacherously against
יהוה, for they have brought forth strange children. Now
a new moon shall devour them with their portions. 
Hos
5:8  “Blow the ram’s horn in Gib‛ah,
the trumpet in Ramah! Shout, O Bĕyth Awen! Behind you, O Binyamin! 
Hos
5:9  “Ephrayim is laid waste in the day
of rebuke. Among the tribes of Yisra’ĕl I shall make known what is
certain. 
Hos
5:10  “The chiefs of Yehuḏah shall
be like those who remove a border – on them I pour out my wrath like water. 
Hos
5:11  “Ephrayim is oppressed, crushed in
judgment, because it pleased him to walk after Tsaw.
Hos
5:12  “So I am to Ephrayim like a moth,
and to the house of Yehuḏah like rottenness. 
Hos
5:13  “When Ephrayim saw his sickness,
and Yehuḏah saw his wound, then Ephrayim went to Ashshur and sent to
Sovereign Yarĕḇ. But he is unable to heal you, or to remove the
wound from you. 
Hos
5:14  “For I am like a lion to Ephrayim,
and like a young lion to the house of Yehuḏah. I Myself tear them and go,
I take them away, and there is no one to deliver. 
Hos
5:15  “I shall go, I shall return to My
place, until they confess their guilt and seek My face, in their distress
diligently search for Me, and say, 
Hos
6:1  ‘Come, and let us turn back to יהוה.
For He has torn but He does heal us, He has stricken but He binds us up. 
Hos
6:2  ‘After two days He shall revive us,
on the third day He shall raise us up, so that we live before Him. 
Hos
6:3  ‘So let us know, let us pursue to
know יהוה. His going forth is as certain as the
morning. And He comes to us like the rain, like the latter rain watering the
earth.’ 
Hos
6:4  “Ephrayim, what would I do with you?
Yehuḏah, what would I do with you? For your trustworthiness is like a
morning cloud, and like the early dew it goes away. 
Hos
6:5  “Therefore I have hewn them by the prophets, I have slain them
by the words of My mouth. And my right-rulings break forth as the light. 
Hos
6:6  “For I delight in kindness and not
slaughtering, and in the knowledge of Elohim more than burnt offerings. 
Hos
6:7  “But like Aḏam they transgressed
the covenant. There they acted treacherously against Me. 
Hos
6:8  “Gil‛aḏ is a city of
workers of wickedness – tracked up with blood. 
Hos
6:9  “And as bands of robbers lie in wait
for a man, so the company of priests murder on the way to Sheḵem, for they
have done wickedness. 
Hos
6:10  “I have seen a horrible matter in
the house of Yisra’ĕl: the whoring of Ephrayim is there, Yisra’ĕl is
defiled. 
Hos
6:11  “Also, a harvest is appointed for
you, O Yehuḏah, when I turn back the captivity of My people. 
Hos
7:1  “Whenever I would heal Yisra’ĕl,
then the crookedness of Ephrayim is uncovered, and the evil deeds of Shomeron.
For they have wrought falsehood, and a thief comes in, a band of robbers raids
outside. 
Hos
7:2  “And they do not say to their hearts
that I remember all their evil. Now their own deeds have surrounded them, they
have been before Me. 
Hos
7:3  “With their evil they make a
sovereign glad, and rulers with their lies. 
Hos
7:4  “All of them are adulterers, as an
oven heated by a baker, who ceases stirring the fire after kneading the dough,
until it is leavened. 
Hos
7:5  “In the day of our sovereign rulers
became sick, inflamed with wine. He extended his hand with scoffers. 
Hos
7:6  “For they have drawn near, their
heart is like an oven. While they lie in wait all the night their baker sleeps.
In the morning it burns like a flaming fire. 
Hos
7:7  “All of them are as hot as an oven,
and they consumed their rulers. All their sovereigns have fallen – not one
among them calls on Me. 
Hos
7:8  “Ephrayim mixes himself among the
peoples, Ephrayim has become a cake unturned. 
Hos
7:9  “Strangers have devoured his
strength, but he does not know it. Grey hairs are also sprinkled on him, and he
does not know it. 
Hos
7:10  “And the Excellency of Yisra’ĕl
did witness to his face, but they did not return to יהוה
their Elohim, nor did they seek Him for all this. 
Hos
7:11  “And Ephrayim has become a simple
dove without heart, they have called on Mitsrayim, they have gone to Ashshur. 
Hos
7:12  “When they go I spread My net over
them, I bring them down like the birds of the heavens, I chastise them as their
congregation has heard. 
Hos
7:13  “Woe to them, for they have strayed
from Me! Destruction to them, because they have transgressed against Me! And I
Myself have ransomed them, yet they have spoken falsehoods against Me, 
Hos
7:14  and did not cry out to Me with
their heart when they wailed upon their beds. For grain and new wine they
assemble themselves; they turn away from Me. 
Hos
7:15  “And I instructed, I strengthened
their arms, but they plot evil against Me. 
Hos
7:16  “They return, but not to the Most
High. They have been like a slack bow. Their rulers fall by the sword for the
cursings of their tongue. This is their scorn in the land of Mitsrayim. 
Hos
8:1  “Put the ram’s horn to your mouth,
like an eagle against the House of יהוה, because they
have transgressed My covenant, and they have rebelled against My Torah. 
Hos
8:2  “They cry out to Me, ‘My Elohim –
we, Yisra’ĕl, know You!’ 
Hos
8:3  “Yisra’ĕl has rejected what is
good, an enemy pursues him. 
Hos
8:4  “They have made sovereigns, but not
from Me. They have made rulers, but I have not known. From their silver and
gold they made idols for themselves, so that they are cut off. 
Hos
8:5  “O Shomeron, your calf has been cast
off! My wrath has burned against them. How long shall they be incapable of
innocence? 
Hos
8:6  “For from Yisra’ĕl is even
this: a workman made it, and it is not Elohim! For the calf of Shomeron is
splinters! 
Hos
8:7  “For they sow the wind, and reap the
whirlwind. The stalk has no bud, it yields no grain. If it does yield,
strangers swallow it up. 
Hos
8:8  “Yisra’ĕl has been swallowed
up. They have now become among the nations as a vessel in which is no pleasure.

Hos
8:9  “For they themselves have gone up to
Ashshur. A wild donkey alone by itself is Ephrayim, they have hired lovers. 
Hos
8:10  “Also, although they sold
themselves among the nations, this time I shall gather them, when they have
suffered for a while from the burden of a sovereign, of rulers. 
Hos
8:11  “Since Ephrayim has made many
altars for sin, they have been altars for sinning to him. 
Hos
8:12  “I have written for him numerous
matters of My Torah – they were regarded as strange. 
Hos
8:13  “As for My offerings: they
slaughter flesh and they eat. יהוה shall not accept
them. Now does He remember their crookedness and punish their sins. Let them
return to Mitsrayim! 
Hos
8:14  “For Yisra’ĕl has forgotten
his Maker, and has built palaces. And Yehuḏah has increased walled
cities. But I shall send fire upon his cities, and it shall devour his
strongholds.” 
Hos
9:1  O Yisra’ĕl, do not rejoice with
exultation like the peoples, for you have whored from your Elohim. You have
loved a love-fee at all threshing-floors. 
Hos
9:2  Threshing floor and winepress shall
not feed them, and new wine shall fail in her. 
Hos
9:3  They shall not dwell in the land of יהוה,
but Ephrayim shall return to Mitsrayim, and eat unclean food in Ashshur. 
Hos
9:4  They do not pour wine offerings to יהוה,
nor are their offerings pleasing to Him – it being like bread of mourners to
them, all who eat it are defiled. For their bread is for their life, it does
not come into the House of יהוה. 
Hos
9:5  What do you do for the appointed
meeting, and in the day of the festival of יהוה ? 
Hos
9:6  For look, they shall go because of
destruction – Mitsrayim gathers them up, Moph buries them, nettles possess
their valuables of silver, thorns are in their tents. 
Hos
9:7  The days of punishment have come, the
days of retribution have come. Yisra’ĕl knows! The prophet is a fool, the ‘man
of the Spirit’ is mad, because of the greatness of your crookedness, and great
is the enmity.
Hos
9:8  Elohim’s watchman over you,
Ephrayim, is the prophet, but a trapper’s snare is in all his ways. Enmity is
in the House of his Elohim. 
Hos
9:9  They have deeply corrupted
themselves, as in the days of Gib‛ah. He remembers their crookedness, He
punishes their sins. 
Hos
9:10  “I found Yisra’ĕl like grapes
in the wilderness. I saw your fathers as the first-fruits on the fig tree in
its beginning. They themselves have gone to Ba‛al Pe‛or, and
separated themselves to shame, and became as abominable as that which they
loved. 
Hos
9:11  “Ephrayim is like a bird, their
esteem has flown away – no birth, and none with child, and no conception! 
Hos
9:12  “Though they bring up their
children, I shall make them childless, without man. For it is woe to them when
I turn away from them! 
Hos
9:13  “I have seen Ephrayim, like Tsor,
planted in a pleasant place. But Ephrayim shall bring out his children to the
murderer.” 
Hos
9:14  Give them, O יהוה
– give what? Give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts. 
Hos
9:15  “All their evil is in Gilgal, for
there I have hated them. Because of the evil of their deeds I drive them from
My house, no more do I love them. All their rulers are rebels. 
Hos
9:16  “Ephrayim has been smitten, their
root has dried up, they yield no fruit. Even if they bear children, I shall put
to death the precious ones of their womb.” 
Hos
9:17  My Elohim rejects them, because
they have not obeyed Him, so that they become wanderers among the gentiles!
Hos
10:1  Yisra’ĕl is a degenerate vine,
he brings forth fruit for himself. As his fruit increased, he increased the
altars. And the better his land, the better they made the pillars. 
Hos
10:2  Their heart has been slippery, now
they are guilty. He breaks down their altars, He destroys their pillars. 
Hos
10:3  For now they say, “We have no
sovereign, because we did not fear יהוה. What would the
sovereign do for us?” 
Hos
10:4  They have spoken words, swearing
falsely in making a covenant. Therefore judgment shall spring up like poisonous
weeds in the furrows of the field. 
Hos
10:5  The inhabitants of Shomeron fear
because of the calf of Bĕyth Awen. For its people shall mourn for it, as
well as its priests who used to rejoice over it, because of its esteem that has
departed from it. 
Hos
10:6  It is also brought to Ashshur as a
present for Sovereign Yarĕḇ. Ephrayim does receive shame, and Yisra’ĕl
is put to shame through his counsel. 
Hos
10:7  Shomeron is cut off, her sovereign
is like a twig on the surface of the water. 
Hos
10:8  And the high places of Awen, the
sin of Yisra’ĕl, shall be destroyed, thorn and thistle come up on their
altars. And they shall say to the mountains, “Cover us!” and to the hills, “Fall
on us!” 
Hos
10:9  “O Yisra’ĕl, you have sinned
from the days of Gib‛ah. There they stood! The battle in Gib‛ah
against the children of perversity did not overtake them. 
Hos
10:10  “When I desire, then I bind them.
And peoples shall be gathered against them when I bind them for their double
guilt. 
Hos
10:11  “And Ephrayim is a trained heifer,
loving to thresh grain. But I Myself shall pass over her comely neck – I put
Ephrayim to the yoke, Yehuḏah ploughs, Ya‛aqoḇ harrows for
him.” 
Hos
10:12  Sow for yourselves righteousness,
reap according to kindness, break up your tillable ground, it is time to seek יהוה,
till He comes and rains righteousness on you.
Hos
10:13  You have ploughed wrongness, you
have reaped unrighteousness, you have eaten the fruit of lying, because you
trusted in your own way, in your many mighty men. 
Hos
10:14  And uproar shall arise among your
people, and all your strongholds shall be ravaged as Shalman ravaged Bĕyth
Arbĕl in the day of battle – a mother dashed in pieces on her children. 
Hos
10:15  Thus it shall be done to you, O Bĕyth
Ĕl, because of the evil of your wickedness. At dawn the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl
is completely cut off! 
Hos
11:1  “When Yisra’ĕl was a child, I
loved him, and out of Mitsrayim I called My son. 
Hos
11:2  “They called to them, so they went
from their face. They slaughtered to the Ba‛als, and burned incense to
carved images. 
Hos
11:3  “And I taught Ephrayim to walk,
taking them by their arms, but they did not know that I healed them. 
Hos
11:4  “I drew them with ropes of man,
with cords of love, and I was to them as those who take the yoke from their
neck. And I bent down, fed them. 
Hos
11:5  “No, let him return to the land of
Mitsrayim, and let Ashshur be his sovereign, because they refused to repent! 
Hos
11:6  “And the sword shall whirl in his
cities, and it shall demolish his gate bars, and consume, because of their own
counsels. 
Hos
11:7  “My people are bent towards
backsliding from Me. Though they call to the Most High, He lifts none of them
up. 
Hos
11:8  “How could I give you up, Ephrayim?
How could I hand you over, Yisra’ĕl? How could I make you like Aḏmah?
How could I set you like Tseḇoyim? My heart turns within Me, all My
compassion is kindled. 
Hos
11:9  “I shall not let the heat of My
wrath burn, I shall not turn to destroy Ephrayim. For I am Ĕl, and not
man, the Set-apart One in your midst, and I shall not come in enmity. 
Hos
11:10  “Let them follow יהוה.
Like a lion He roars. When He roars, then sons shall tremble from the west. 
Hos
11:11  “They shall tremble like a bird
from Mitsrayim, and like a dove from the land of Ashshur. And I shall let them
dwell in their own houses,” declares יהוה. 
Hos
11:12  “Ephrayim has surrounded Me with
lying, and the house of Yisra’ĕl with deceit. But Yehuḏah is still
wandering with Ĕl, and is true to the Set-apart One.” 
Hos
12:1  Ephrayim is feeding on wind, and
pursuing an east wind. All the day he increases falsehood and ruin. And they
make a covenant with Ashshur, and oil is sent to Mitsrayim. 
Hos
12:2  And יהוה
has a controversy with Yehuḏah, to punish Ya‛aqoḇ according
to his ways, to repay him according to his deeds. 
Hos
12:3  He took his brother by the heel in
the womb, and in his strength he strove with Elohim. 
Hos
12:4  He strove with the Messenger and
overcame, he wept and sought His favour. He found Him in Bĕyth Ĕl,
and there He spoke to us –
Hos
12:5  even יהוה Elohim
of hosts, יהוה is His remembrance. 
Hos
12:6  Therefore, return to your Elohim.
Guard kindness and right-ruling, and wait on your Elohim continually. 
Hos
12:7  A merchant! In his hand are scales
of deceit, he loved to oppress. 
Hos
12:8  And Ephrayim says, “Indeed, I have
become rich, I have found wealth for myself. In all my labours they shall find
in me no crookedness that is sin.” 
Hos
12:9  “But I am יהוה
your Elohim since the land of Mitsrayim, again I shall make you dwell in tents
as in the days of the appointed time.
Hos
12:10  “And I have spoken to the
prophets, and have increased visions. And through the prophets I gave parables.”

Hos
12:11  Is Gil‛aḏ wicked?
Certainly, they have been false! In Gilgal they have offered bulls. Also their
altars are as heaps on a ploughed field. 
Hos
12:12  And when Ya‛aqoḇ fled
to the country of Aram, Yisra’ĕl served for a wife, and for a wife he kept
watch. 
Hos
12:13  And by a prophet יהוה
brought Yisra’ĕl out of Mitsrayim, and by a prophet he was watched over. 
Hos
12:14  Ephrayim has provoked most
bitterly. So his Master left his blood-guilt on him, and repaid him for his
reproach. 
Hos
13:1  When Ephrayim spoke there was
trembling, he was lifted up in Yisra’ĕl. But through Ba‛al he became
guilty, and he died. 
Hos
13:2  And now they sin more and more, and
make for themselves moulded images from their silver, idols according to their
skill, all of them the work of craftsmen. They say of them, “Let the men who
slaughter kiss the calves!” 
Hos
13:3  Therefore they shall be like a
morning cloud, and like dew that goes away early, like chaff blown off from a
threshing-floor, and like smoke from a window. 
Hos
13:4  “But I am יהוה
your Elohim since the land of Mitsrayim, and an Elohim besides Me you shall not
know, for there is no Saviour besides Me. 
Hos
13:5  “I knew you in the wilderness, in
the land of drought. 
Hos
13:6  “When they were fed they were
satisfied. They were satisfied and their heart was exalted, therefore they
forgot Me. 
Hos
13:7  “So I am become like a lion to
them, like a leopard I watch by the way, 
Hos
13:8  like a bear robbed of her young I
attack them and rip open the enclosure of their heart. And there I devour them
like a lion, a wild beast tear them apart. 
Hos
13:9  “You have destroyed yourself, O
Yisra’ĕl, but your help is in Me. 
Hos
13:10  “Where is your sovereign now to
save you in all your cities, and your rulers of whom you said, ‘Give me a
sovereign and rulers’? 
Hos
13:11  “I gave you a sovereign in My
displeasure, but I took him away in
My wrath. 
Hos
13:12  “The crookedness of Ephrayim is
bound up, his sin is hidden. 
Hos
13:13  “Pains of a woman in labour shall
come upon him. He is not a wise son, for it is not the time that he should
delay at the breaking forth of children. 
Hos
13:14  “From the power of the grave I
ransom them, from death I redeem them. Where is your plague, O Death? Where is
your destruction, O Grave? Repentance is hidden from My eyes. 
Hos
13:15  “Though he bears fruit among his
brothers, an east wind comes, a wind from יהוה comes up
from the wilderness, and it dries up his fountain, and his spring becomes dry –
it plunders a treasure of all desirable objects. 
Hos
13:16  “Shomeron is held guilty, for she
has rebelled against her Elohim – they fall by the sword, their infants are
dashed in pieces, and their pregnant women ripped open.” 
Hos
14:1  O Yisra’ĕl, return to יהוה
your Elohim, for you have stumbled by your crookedness. 
Hos
14:2  Take words with you, and return to יהוה.
Say to Him, “Take away all crookedness, and accept what is good, and we render
the bulls of our lips.
Hos
14:3  “Ashshur does not save us. We do
not ride on horses, nor ever again do we say to the work of our hands, ‘Our
mighty ones.’ For the fatherless finds compassion in You.” 
Hos
14:4  “I shall heal their backsliding, I
shall love them spontaneously, for My displeasure has turned away from him. 
Hos
14:5  “I shall be like the dew to Yisra’ĕl.
He shall blossom like the lily, and cast out his roots like Leḇanon. 
Hos
14:6  “His branches shall spread, and his
splendour shall be like an olive tree, and his fragrance like Leḇanon. 
Hos
14:7  “Those who dwell under his shadow
shall return. They shall revive like grain, and blossom like the vine, and
become as fragrant as the wine of Leḇanon. 
Hos
14:8  “What more has Ephrayim to do with
idols? It is I who answer and look after him. I am like a green cypress tree,
your fruit comes from Me.” 
Hos
14:9  Who is wise and understands these words, discerning and knows them? For the
ways of יהוה are straight, and the righteous walk in
them, but the transgressors stumble in them.
