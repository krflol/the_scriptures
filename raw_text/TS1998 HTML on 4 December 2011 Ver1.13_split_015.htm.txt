Shemu’ĕl Aleph/1 Samuel
1Sam
1:1  And there was a certain man of
Ramathayim Tsophim, of the mountains of Ephrayim, and his name was Elqanah son
of Yeroḥam, son of Elihu, son of Tohu, son of Tsuph, an Ephrayimite. 
1Sam
1:2  And he had two wives, the name of
one was Ḥannah, and the name of the other Peninnah. And Peninnah had
children, but Ḥannah had no children. 
1Sam
1:3  Now this man went up from his city
year by year to worship and to slaughter to יהוה of
hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Ĕli, Ḥophni and Pineḥas,
the priests of יהוה, were there. 
1Sam
1:4  And when the day came for Elqanah to
make an offering, he gave portions to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and
daughters, 
1Sam
1:5  but, although he loved Ḥannah,
he gave only one portion to Ḥannah, because יהוה
had shut up her womb. 
1Sam
1:6  Moreover, her rival also provoked
her greatly, to make her irritable, because יהוה had
shut up her womb. 
1Sam
1:7  And so he did, year by year.
Whenever she went up to the House of יהוה, she was
provoked, so that she wept and did not eat. 
1Sam
1:8  And her husband Elqanah said to her,
“Ḥannah, why do you weep? Why do you not eat? And why is your heart sad?
Am I not better to you than ten sons?” 
1Sam
1:9  And Ḥannah rose up after
eating and drinking in Shiloh, while Ĕli the priest was sitting on the
seat by the doorpost of the Hĕḵal of יהוה. 
1Sam
1:10  And she was bitter in life, and
prayed to יהוה and wept greatly. 
1Sam
1:11  And she made a vow and said, “O יהוה
of hosts, if You would indeed look on the affliction of your female servant and
remember me, and not forget your female servant, but shall give your female
servant a male child, then I shall give him to יהוה all
the days of his life, and let no razor come upon his head.” 
1Sam
1:12  And it came to be, as she kept on
praying before יהוה, that Ĕli was watching her
mouth. 
1Sam
1:13  And Ḥannah spoke in her
heart, only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard. So Ĕli thought
she was drunk. 
1Sam
1:14  Then Ĕli said to her, “How
long are you going to be drunk? Put your wine away from you!” 
1Sam
1:15  And Ḥannah answered and said,
“No, my master, I am a woman pained in spirit. And I have drunk neither wine
nor strong drink, but have poured out my being before יהוה.

1Sam
1:16  “Do not take your female servant
for a daughter of Beliya‛al, for it is out of my great concern and
provocation that I have spoken until now.” 
1Sam
1:17  And Ĕli answered and said, “Go
in peace, and the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl give you your petition which you have
asked of Him.” 
1Sam
1:18  And she said, “Let your female
servant find favour in your eyes.” And the woman went her way and ate, and her
face was no more sad. 
1Sam
1:19  And they rose up early in the
morning and worshipped before יהוה, and returned and
came to their house at Ramah. And Elqanah knew Ḥannah his wife, and יהוה
remembered her. 
1Sam
1:20  And it came to be at the turn of
days, that Ḥannah conceived and bore a son, and called his name Shemu’ĕl,
“Because I have asked יהוה for him.” 
1Sam
1:21  And the man Elqanah and all his
house went up to offer to יהוה the yearly slaughtering
and his vow. 
1Sam
1:22  But Ḥannah did not go up, for
she said to her husband, “When the child is weaned, then I shall take him. And
he shall appear before יהוה and remain forever there.” 
1Sam
1:23  And her husband Elqanah said to
her, “Do what is good in your eyes. Remain until you have weaned him. Only let יהוה
establish His word.” And the woman remained and nursed her son until she had
weaned him. 
1Sam
1:24  And when she had weaned him, she
took him up with her, with three bulls, and one ĕphah of flour, and a skin
of wine, and brought him to the House of יהוה in
Shiloh. And the child was young. 
1Sam
1:25  And they slaughtered a bull, and
brought the child to Ĕli. 
1Sam
1:26  And she said, “O my master! As your
being lives, my master, I am the woman who stood by you here, praying to יהוה.

1Sam
1:27  “I prayed for this youth, and יהוה
has granted me what I asked of Him. 
1Sam
1:28  “So I have also loaned him to יהוה.
All the days that he lives he shall be loaned to יהוה.”
And he worshipped there before יהוה. 
1Sam
2:1  And Ḥannah prayed and said, “My
heart rejoices in יהוה, my horn has been high in יהוה.
My mouth is opened wide over my enemies, for I have rejoiced in Your
deliverance. 
1Sam
2:2  “There is no one set-apart like יהוה,
for there is no one besides You, and there is no rock like our Elohim. 
1Sam
2:3  “Do not multiply words so proudly,
proudly; let no arrogance come from your mouth, for יהוה
is an Ĕl of knowledge, and by Him deeds are weighed. 
1Sam
2:4  “Bows of the mighty are broken, and
those who stumble shall be girded with strength. 
1Sam
2:5  “The satisfied have hired themselves
out for bread, and the hungry have ceased. Even the barren has borne seven, and
she who has many children pines away. 
1Sam
2:6  “ יהוה puts
to death and makes alive, He brings down to the grave and raises up. 
1Sam
2:7  “ יהוה makes
poor and makes rich, He brings low and lifts up. 
1Sam
2:8  “He raises the poor from the dust,
He lifts the needy from the dunghill, to sit with princes, and make them
inherit a throne of esteem. For the supports of the earth belong to יהוה,
and He has set the world upon them. 
1Sam
2:9  “He guards the feet of His kind
ones, but the wrong are silent in darkness, for man does not become mighty by
power. 
1Sam
2:10  “Those who oppose יהוה
are shattered, from the heavens He thunders against them. יהוה
judges the ends of the earth, and gives strength to His sovereign, and exalts
the horn of His anointed.” 
1Sam
2:11  And Elqanah went to his house at
Ramah. But the youth served יהוה before Ĕli the
priest.
1Sam
2:12  And the sons of Ĕli were sons
of Beliya‛al – they did not know יהוה.
1Sam
2:13  And the ruling of the priests with
the people was that when any man offered a slaughtering, the priest’s servant
shall come with a three-pronged flesh-hook in his hand while the meat was
cookling,
1Sam
2:14  and shall thrust it into the basin,
or kettle, or cauldron, or pot. And the priest would take for himself all that
the flesh-hook brought up. Thus they did in Shiloh to all the Yisra’ĕlites
who came there.
1Sam
2:15  Also, before they burned the fat,
the priest’s servant would come and say to the man who slaughtered, “Give meat
for roasting to the priest, for he does not accept cooked meat from you, but
raw.” 
1Sam
2:16  And if the man said to him, “Let
the fat be burned up first, then take as much as your being desires,” he would
then answer him, “No, but give it to me now. And if not, I shall take it by
strength.” 
1Sam
2:17  And the sin of the young men was
very great before יהוה, for the men despised the
offering of יהוה. 
1Sam
2:18  But Shemu’ĕl was attending
before יהוה – a youth, wearing a linen shoulder
garment. 
1Sam
2:19  And his mother would make him a
little robe, and bring it to him year by year when she came up with her husband
to offer the yearly slaughtering. 
1Sam
2:20  And Ĕli blessed Elqanah and
his wife, and said, “ יהוה give you offspring from this
woman for the one she prayed for and gave to יהוה.”
Then they would go to their own home. 
1Sam
2:21  And יהוה
visited Ḥannah, so that she conceived and bore three sons and two
daughters, while the young Shemu’ĕl grew before יהוה.

1Sam
2:22  And Ĕli was very old, and had
heard all that his sons were doing to all Yisra’ĕl, and how they lay with
the women who were assembling at the door of the Tent of Meeting. 
1Sam
2:23  And he said to them, “Why do you do
deeds like these? For I hear of your evil deeds from all the people. 
1Sam
2:24  “No, my sons! For it is not a good
report that I hear: making the people of יהוה
transgress. 
1Sam
2:25  “If one man sins against another,
Elohim shall judge him. But if a man sins against יהוה,
who shall pray for him?” But they did not listen to the voice of their father,
though יהוה was pleased to put them to death. 
1Sam
2:26  And the young Shemu’ĕl was
growing in stature, and was in favour with יהוה and
also with men. 
1Sam
2:27  And a man of Elohim came to Ĕli
and said to him, “Thus said יהוה, ‘Did I not clearly
reveal Myself to the house of your father when they were in Mitsrayim in
Pharaoh’s house, 
1Sam
2:28  even to choose him out of all the
tribes of Yisra’ĕl to be My priest, to offer upon My altar, to burn
incense, and to wear a shoulder garment before Me? And did I not give to the
house of your father all the offerings of the children of Yisra’ĕl made by
fire? 
1Sam
2:29  ‘Why do you kick at My slaughtering
and My offering which I have commanded in My Dwelling Place, and esteem your
sons above Me, to make yourselves fat with the best of all the offerings of
Yisra’ĕl My people?’ 
1Sam
2:30  “Therefore יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl declares, ‘I said indeed that your house and the house
of your father would walk before Me forever.’ But now יהוה
declares, ‘Far be it from Me, for those who highly
esteem Me I highly esteem, and those
who despise Me are lightly esteemed. 
1Sam
2:31  ‘See, the days are coming that I
shall cut off your arm and the arm of your father’s house, so that an old man
shall not be found in your house. 
1Sam
2:32  ‘And you shall see an enemy in My
Dwelling Place, despite all the good which Elohim does for Yisra’ĕl, and
there shall not be an old man in your house forever. 
1Sam
2:33  ‘But any of your men whom I do not
cut off from My altar is to consume your eyes and grieve your life, and all the
increase of your house die as men. 
1Sam
2:34  ‘And this is the sign to you that
comes upon your two sons, upon Ḥophni and Pineḥas: in one day they
are going to die, both of them. 
1Sam
2:35  ‘And I shall raise up for Myself a
trustworthy priest who does according to what is in My heart and in My being.
And I shall build him a steadfast house, and he shall walk before My anointed
forever. 
1Sam
2:36  ‘And it shall be that everyone who
is left in your house shall come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and
a cake of bread, and say, “Please, put me in one of the priestly positions to
eat a piece of bread.” ’ ” 
1Sam
3:1  And the young Shemu’ĕl was
serving יהוה before Ĕli. And the word of יהוה
was rare in those days – no vision breaking forth. 
1Sam
3:2  And it came to be in that day, that Ĕli
was lying down in his place. And his eyes had begun to grow so dim that he was
unable to see, 
1Sam
3:3  And the lamp of Elohim had not gone
out in the Hĕḵal of יהוה where the ark of
Elohim was, and Shemu’ĕl was lying down to sleep. 
1Sam
3:4  And יהוה
called Shemu’ĕl, and he answered, “Here I am!” 
1Sam
3:5  He then ran to Ĕli and said, “Here
I am, for you called me.” But he said, “I did not call – lie down again.” So he
went and lay down. 
1Sam
3:6  And יהוה
again called, “Shemu’ĕl!” And Shemu’ĕl arose and went to Ĕli,
and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” But he answered, “My son, I did not
call – lie down again.” 
1Sam
3:7  Now Shemu’ĕl did not yet know יהוה,
and the word of יהוה was not yet revealed to him. 
1Sam
3:8  And יהוה
called Shemu’ĕl again the third time, and he arose and went to Ĕli,
and said, “Here I am, for you did call me.” Then Ĕli understood that יהוה
had called the youth. 
1Sam
3:9  So Ĕli said to Shemu’ĕl, “Go,
lie down. And it shall be, if He calls you, say, ‘Speak, יהוה,
for Your servant hears.’ ” And Shemu’ĕl went and lay down in his place. 
1Sam
3:10  And יהוה
came and stood and called as at other times, “Shemu’ĕl! Shemu’ĕl!”
And Shemu’ĕl answered, “Speak, for Your servant hears.” 
1Sam
3:11  And יהוה
said to Shemu’ĕl, “See, I am doing a matter in Yisra’ĕl at which both
ears of everyone who hears it shall tingle. 
1Sam
3:12  “In that day I shall confirm
against Ĕli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from beginning to
end. 
1Sam
3:13  “For I have declared to him that I
am judging his house forever for the crookedness which he knows, because his
sons cursed Elohim, and he did not rebuke them. 
1Sam
3:14  “And therefore I have sworn to the
house of Ĕli that the crookedness of the house of Ĕli shall never be
atoned for, by slaughtering or grain offering.” 
1Sam
3:15  And Shemu’ĕl lay down until
morning, and opened the doors of the House of יהוה. And
Shemu’ĕl was afraid to report the vision to Ĕli. 
1Sam
3:16  Then Ĕli called Shemu’ĕl
and said, “Shemu’ĕl, my son!” And he answered, “Here I am.” 
1Sam
3:17  And he said, “What is the word that
He spoke to you? Please do not hide it from me. Elohim do so to you, and more
also, if you hide a word from me of all the words that He spoke to you.”
1Sam
3:18  And Shemu’ĕl reported to him
all the words, and hid none from him. And he said, “It is יהוה.
Let Him do what is good in His eyes.” 
1Sam
3:19  And Shemu’ĕl grew up, and יהוה
was with him and did not let any of his words fall to the ground. 
1Sam
3:20  And all Yisra’ĕl from Dan to
Be’ĕrsheḇa knew that Shemu’ĕl had been established as a prophet
of יהוה. 
1Sam
3:21  And יהוה
continued to appear in Shiloh, because יהוה revealed
Himself to Shemu’ĕl in Shiloh by the word of יהוה.

1Sam
4:1  Thus the word of Shemu’ĕl was
to all Yisra’ĕl. And Yisra’ĕl went out to battle against the
Philistines, and encamped beside Eḇen Ha‛ĕzer, while the
Philistines encamped in Aphĕq. 
1Sam
4:2  And the Philistines put themselves
in battle array against Yisra’ĕl. And when the battle spread, Yisra’ĕl
was smitten by the Philistines, who killed about four thousand men of the army
in the field. 
1Sam
4:3  And when the people came into the
camp, the elders of Yisra’ĕl said, “Why has יהוה
smitten us today before the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of the covenant
of יהוה from Shiloh to us, so that He comes into our
midst and save us from the hand of our enemies.” 
1Sam
4:4  And the people sent to Shiloh, and
they brought from there the ark of the covenant of יהוה
of hosts, dwelling between the keruḇim. And the two sons of Ĕli, Ḥophni
and Pineḥas, were there with the ark of the covenant of Elohim. 
1Sam
4:5  And when the ark of the covenant of יהוה
came into the camp, all Yisra’ĕl shouted so loudly that the earth shook. 
1Sam
4:6  And when the Philistines heard the
noise of the shout, they said, “What is the noise of this great shout in the
camp of the Heḇrews?” And when they knew that the ark of יהוה
had come into the camp, 
1Sam
4:7  the Philistines were afraid, for
they said, “Elohim has come into the camp!” And they said, “Woe to us! For it
has never been like this before. 
1Sam
4:8  “Woe to us! Who shall deliver us
from the hand of these mighty Elohim? These are the Elohim who smote the
Mitsrites with all the plagues in the wilderness. 
1Sam
4:9  “Be strong and be men, you Philistines,
that you do not become servants of the Heḇrews, as they have been to you.
Be men, and fight!” 
1Sam
4:10  And the Philistines fought, and
Yisra’ĕl was smitten, and every man fled to his tent. And the slaughter
was very great, and there fell of Yisra’ĕl thirty thousand foot soldiers. 
1Sam
4:11  And the ark of Elohim was captured,
and the two sons of Ĕli died, Ḥophni and Pineḥas. 
1Sam
4:12  And a man of Binyamin ran from the
battle line the same day, and came to Shiloh with his garments torn and dirt on
his head. 
1Sam
4:13  And he came in and saw Ĕli,
sitting on a seat by the wayside watching, for his heart trembled for the ark
of Elohim. And the man came into the city and reported it, and all the city
cried out. 
1Sam
4:14  And Ĕli heard the noise of the
outcry and said, “What is the noise of this uproar?” And the man came hastily
and informed Ĕli. 
1Sam
4:15  Now Ĕli was ninety-eight years
old and his eyes were so dim that he was unable to see. 
1Sam
4:16  And the man said to Ĕli, “I am
he who came from the battle. And I fled today from the battle line.” And he
said, “What was the matter, my son?” 
1Sam
4:17  And the messenger answered and
said, “Yisra’ĕl has fled before the Philistines, and there has been a
great slaughter among the people. And your two sons have died, Ḥophni and
Pineḥas, and the ark of Elohim has been captured.” 
1Sam
4:18  And it came to be, when he made
mention of the ark of Elohim, that Ĕli fell off the seat backward by the
side of the gate. And his neck was broken and he died, for the man was old and
heavy. And he ruled Yisra’ĕl forty years. 
1Sam
4:19  And his daughter-in-law,
Pineḥas’ wife, was pregnant, about to bear. And when she heard the news
that the ark of Elohim was captured, and that her father-in-law and her husband
were dead, she bowed herself and gave birth, because her pains came upon her. 
1Sam
4:20  And about the time of her death the
women who stood by her said to her, “Do not fear, for you have borne a son.”
But she did not answer, nor did she set her heart to it. 
1Sam
4:21  And she called the child Iḵaḇoḏ,
saying, “The esteem has departed from Yisra’ĕl!” because the ark of Elohim
was taken and because of her father-in-law and her husband. 
1Sam
4:22  And she said, “The esteem has departed
from Yisra’ĕl, for the ark of Elohim was taken.” 
1Sam
5:1  And the Philistines took the ark of
Elohim and brought it from Eḇen Ha‛ĕzer to Ashdoḏ, 
1Sam
5:2  and the Philistines took the ark of
Elohim and brought it into the house of Daḡon and set it by Daḡon. 
1Sam
5:3  And the Ashdoḏites rose early
in the morning and saw Daḡon fallen on its face to the ground before the
ark of יהוה. So they took Daḡon and put it in its
place again.
1Sam
5:4  And they arose early the next
morning and saw Daḡon fallen on its face to the ground before the ark of יהוה,
and the head of Daḡon and both the palms of its hands cut off, on the
threshold, only Daḡon itself was left of it. 
1Sam
5:5  That is why, to this day, the
priests of Daḡon and all who come into Daḡon’s house do not tread
on the threshold of Daḡon in Ashdoḏ. 
1Sam
5:6  But the hand of יהוה
was heavy on the Ashdoḏites, and He wasted them and smote them with
tumours – Ashdoḏ and its borders.
1Sam
5:7  And when the men of Ashdoḏ saw
this, they said, “Let not the ark of the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl remain with
us, for His hand has been hard on us, and on Daḡon our mighty one.” 
1Sam
5:8  Then they sent and gathered to them
all the princes of the Philistines, and said, “What do we do with the ark of
the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl?” And they answered, “Let the ark of the Elohim of
Yisra’ĕl be removed to Gath.” And they removed the ark of the Elohim of
Yisra’ĕl. 
1Sam
5:9  And it came to be, after they
removed it, that the hand of יהוה was against the city
with a very great destruction. And He smote the men of the city, from the least
to the greatest, and tumours broke out on them.
1Sam
5:10  They then sent the ark of Elohim to
Eqron. And it came to be, as the ark of Elohim came to Eqron, that the
Eqronites cried out, saying, “They have removed the ark of the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl
to us, to kill us and our people!” 
1Sam
5:11  And they sent and gathered together
all the princes of the Philistines, and said, “Send away the ark of the Elohim
of Yisra’ĕl, and let it return to its own place, so that it does not kill
us and our people.” For there had come a deadly destruction throughout all the
city – the hand of Elohim was very heavy there. 
1Sam
5:12  And the men who did not die were
smitten with tumours, and the cry of the city went up to the heavens. 
1Sam
6:1  And the ark of יהוה
was in the field of the Philistines for seven months. 
1Sam
6:2  And the Philistines called for the
priests and the diviners, saying, “What do we do with the ark of יהוה
? Let us know with what we should send it to its place.” 
1Sam
6:3  And they said, “If you send away the
ark of the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, do not send it empty, but you shall
certainly return it to Him with a guilt offering. Then you are going to be
healed, and it shall be known to you why His hand does not turn aside from you.”

1Sam
6:4  And they said, “What is the guilt
offering which we return to Him?” And they answered, “The number of the princes
of the Philistines: five golden tumours and five golden rats. For the same
plague was on all of you and on your princes. 
1Sam
6:5  “And you shall make images of your
tumours and images of your rats that ruin the land, and you shall give esteem
to the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl. It could be that He does lift His hand from
you, from your mighty ones, and from your land. 
1Sam
6:6  “And why do you harden your hearts
as the Mitsrites and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? When He had severely dealt
with them, did they not send them away, and they went? 
1Sam
6:7  “And now, take and make a new wagon,
and two milk cows which have never been yoked, and hitch the cows to the wagon.
And take their calves home, away from them. 
1Sam
6:8  “And take the ark of יהוה
and put it on the wagon. And put the objects of gold which you are returning to
Him as a guilt offering in a chest by its side, and send it away, and it shall
go. 
1Sam
6:9  “And you shall see, if it goes up
the way to its own border, to Bĕyth Shemesh, then He has done us this
great evil. But if not, then we shall know that His hand has not come against
us – an accident it was to us.”
1Sam
6:10  And the men did so and took two
milk cows and hitched them to the wagon, and shut up their calves at home. 
1Sam
6:11  And they put the ark of יהוה
on the wagon, and the chest with the gold rats and the images of their tumours.

1Sam
6:12  And the cows went straight for the
way to Bĕyth Shemesh, and went along the highway, bellowing as they went,
and did not turn aside, right or left. And the princes of the Philistines went after
them to the border of Bĕyth Shemesh. 
1Sam
6:13  And they of Bĕyth Shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the
valley. And they lifted their eyes and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it. 
1Sam
6:14  And the wagon came into the field
of Yehoshua of Bĕyth Shemesh and stood there, and there was a great stone.
So they split the wood of the wagon and offered the cows as a burnt offering to
יהוה. 
1Sam
6:15  And the Lĕwites took down the
ark of יהוה and the chest that was with it, in which
were the objects of gold, and put them on the great stone. And the men of Bĕyth
Shemesh slaughtered burnt offerings and made offerings the same day to יהוה.

1Sam
6:16  And when the five princes of the
Philistines saw it, they returned to Eqron the same day. 
1Sam
6:17  And these are the gold tumours
which the Philistines returned as a guilt offering to יהוה
: one for Ashdoḏ, one for Azzah, one for Ashqelon, one for Gath, one for
Eqron, 
1Sam
6:18  and the gold rats, by the number of
all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five princes, both walled
cities and country villages, even as far as the great meadow on which they
placed the ark of יהוה, remain to this day in the field of Yehoshua of Bĕyth Shemesh. 
1Sam
6:19  And He smote among the men of Bĕyth
Shemesh, for they had looked into the ark of יהוה. He
smote among the people seventy men, and the people mourned because יהוה
smote among the people, a great smiting. 
1Sam
6:20  And the men of Bĕyth Shemesh
said, “Who is able to stand before this set-apart יהוה
Elohim? And to whom shall He go from us?” 
1Sam
6:21  And they sent messengers to the
inhabitants of Qiryath Ye‛arim, saying, “The Philistines have brought
back the ark of יהוה. Come down, take it up to you.” 
1Sam
7:1  And the men of Qiryath Ye‛arim
came and took the ark of יהוה, and brought it into the
house of Aḇinaḏaḇ on the hill, and set apart El‛azar
his son to guard the ark of יהוה. 
1Sam
7:2  And it came to be, from the day that
the ark remained in Qiryath Ye‛arim, that the time increased, it came to
be twenty years. And all the house of Yisra’ĕl lamented after יהוה.

1Sam
7:3  And Shemu’ĕl spoke to all the
house of Yisra’ĕl, saying, “If you return to יהוה
with all your hearts, then put away the foreign mighty ones and Ashtaroth from
among you, and prepare your hearts for יהוה, and serve
Him only, so that He delivers you from the hand of the Philistines.” 
1Sam
7:4  And the children of Yisra’ĕl
put away the Ba‛als and Ashtaroth, and served יהוה
only. 
1Sam
7:5  And Shemu’ĕl said, “Gather all
Yisra’ĕl to Mitspah and let me pray to יהוה for
you.” 
1Sam
7:6  And they gathered to Mitspah and
drew water, and poured it out before יהוה. And they
fasted that day, and said there, “We have sinned against יהוה.”
And Shemu’ĕl rightly ruled the children of Yisra’ĕl at Mitspah. 
1Sam
7:7  And when the Philistines heard that
the children of Yisra’ĕl had gathered together at Mitspah, the princes of
the Philistines went up against Yisra’ĕl. And the children of Yisra’ĕl
heard of it, and were afraid of the Philistines. 
1Sam
7:8  And the children of Yisra’ĕl
said to Shemu’ĕl, “Do not cease to cry out to יהוה
our Elohim for us, that He would save us from the hand of the Philistines.” 
1Sam
7:9  And Shemu’ĕl took a suckling
lamb and offered it as a burnt offering, completely, to יהוה.
And Shemu’ĕl cried out to יהוה for Yisra’ĕl,
and יהוה answered him. 
1Sam
7:10  And it came to be, as Shemu’ĕl
offered up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against
Yisra’ĕl. But יהוה thundered with a great noise on
that day on the Philistines, and troubled them, and they were smitten before
Yisra’ĕl. 
1Sam
7:11  And the men of Yisra’ĕl went
out from Mitspah and pursued the Philistines, and drove them back as far as
below Bĕyth Kar. 
1Sam
7:12  And Shemu’ĕl took a stone and set
it up between Mitspah and Shĕn, and called its name Eḇen Ha‛ĕzer,
saying, “Thus far יהוה has helped us.” 
1Sam
7:13  Thus the Philistines were humbled,
and no longer came into the border of Yisra’ĕl. And the hand of יהוה
was against the Philistines all the days of Shemu’ĕl. 
1Sam
7:14  And the cities which the
Philistines had taken from Yisra’ĕl were returned to Yisra’ĕl, from
Eqron to Gath. And Yisra’ĕl recovered its border from the hands of the
Philistines. And there was peace between Yisra’ĕl and the Amorites. 
1Sam
7:15  And Shemu’ĕl rightly ruled
Yisra’ĕl all the days of his life, 
1Sam
7:16  and each year he made the rounds of
Bĕyth Ĕl, and Gilgal, and Mitspah, and rightly ruled Yisra’ĕl in
all those places. 
1Sam
7:17  Then he returned to Ramah, for his
home was there. And there he rightly ruled Yisra’ĕl, and there he built an
altar to יהוה. 
1Sam
8:1  And it came to be, when Shemu’ĕl
was old, that he made his sons rulers over Yisra’ĕl. 
1Sam
8:2  And the name of his first-born was
Yo’ĕl, and the name of his second, Aḇiyah, rulers in Be’ĕrsheḇa.

1Sam
8:3  But his sons did not walk in his
ways, and turned aside after own gain, and took bribes, and twisted
right-ruling. 
1Sam
8:4  And all the elders of Yisra’ĕl
gathered together and came to Shemu’ĕl at Ramah, 
1Sam
8:5  and said to him, “Look, you are old,
and your sons do not walk in your ways. Now appoint for us a sovereign to rule
us like all the nations.”
1Sam
8:6  But the word was evil in the eyes of
Shemu’ĕl when they said, “Give us a sovereign to rule us.” So Shemu’ĕl
prayed to יהוה. 
1Sam
8:7  And יהוה
said to Shemu’ĕl, “Listen to the voice of the people in all that they say
to you, for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected Me from reigning
over them. 
1Sam
8:8  “According to all the works which
they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Mitsrayim, even to
this day – forsaking Me and serving other mighty ones – so they are doing to
you too. 
1Sam
8:9  “And now, listen to their voice, but
you shall certainly warn them, and shall make known to them the ruling of the
sovereign who does reign over them.” 
1Sam
8:10  And Shemu’ĕl spoke all the
words of יהוה to the people who asked him for a
sovereign, 
1Sam
8:11  and said, “This is the ruling of
the sovereign who does reign over you: He shall take your sons and appoint them
for his own chariots and to be his horsemen, and they shall run before his
chariots, 
1Sam
8:12  and appoint commanders over his
thousands and commanders over his fifties, or to plough his ground and reap his
harvest, or to make his weapons, and equipment for his chariots. 
1Sam
8:13  “And your daughters he is going to
take to be perfumers, and cooks, and bakers. 
1Sam
8:14  “And the best of your fields, and
your vineyards, and your olive-trees he is going to take and give them to his
servants. 
1Sam
8:15  “And a tenth of your grain and your
vintage he is going to take and give it to his officers and servants.
1Sam
8:16  “And your male servants and your
female servants and your best young men and your donkeys he is going to take
and use for his own work. 
1Sam
8:17  “A tenth of your sheep he is going
to take, and you are to be his servants. 
1Sam
8:18  “And you shall cry out in that day
because of your sovereign whom you have chosen for yourselves, but יהוה
is not going to answer you in that day.” 
1Sam
8:19  However, the people refused to
listen to the voice of Shemu’ĕl, and said, “No, but let a sovereign be
over us. 
1Sam
8:20  Then we shall be, we also, like all
the nations, and our sovereign shall rule us and go out before us and fight our
battles.” 
1Sam
8:21  And Shemu’ĕl heard all the
words of the people, and he repeated them in the hearing of יהוה.

1Sam
8:22  And יהוה
said to Shemu’ĕl, “Listen to their voice, and make them a sovereign.” And
Shemu’ĕl said to the men of Yisra’ĕl, “Each of you go to his city.” 
1Sam
9:1  And there was a man of Binyamin
whose name was Qish, son of Aḇi’ĕl, son of Tseror, son of Beḵorath,
son of Aphiyaḥ, a Binyamite, a mighty man of power. 
1Sam
9:2  And he had a son whose name was Sha’ul,
young and handsome. And there was not a more handsome man than he among the
children of Yisra’ĕl, taller than any of the people by the shoulders and
upwards. 
1Sam
9:3  And the donkeys of Qish, father of
Sha’ul, were lost. And Qish said to his son Sha’ul, “Please take one of the
servants with you, and arise, go seek the donkeys.” 
1Sam
9:4  And he passed through the mountains
of Ephrayim and through the land of Shalishah, but they did not find them. Then
they passed through the land of Sha‛alim, but they were not. Then he
passed through the land of the Binyamites, but they did not find them. 
1Sam
9:5  They came to the land of Tsuph, and
Sha’ul said to his servant who was with him, “Come, let us turn back, lest my
father stops thinking about the
donkeys and become worried about us.” 
1Sam
9:6  And he said to him, “See, there is
in this city a man of Elohim, and the man is esteemed. All that he says comes
true, without fail. Now, let us go there. It could be that he shows us the way
to go.” 
1Sam
9:7  And Sha’ul said to his servant, “But
look, if we go, what do we bring the man? For the bread in our bags is all
gone, and there is no present to bring to the man of Elohim. What do we have?” 
1Sam
9:8  And the servant answered Sha’ul
again and said, “Look, I have here at hand one fourth of a sheqel of silver.
And I shall give that to the man of Elohim, and he shall make known to us our
way.” 
1Sam
9:9  Formerly, in Yisra’ĕl, when a
man went to inquire of Elohim, he spoke thus, “Come, let us go to the seer,”
for the prophet of today was formerly called a seer. 
1Sam
9:10  And Sha’ul said to his servant, “Your
word is good. Come, let us go.” And they went to the city where the man of
Elohim was. 
1Sam
9:11  As they went up the hill to the
city, they met some young women going out to draw water, and said to them, “Is
the seer here?” 
1Sam
9:12  And they answered them and said, “He
is. Look, ahead of you. Hurry now, for he came to this city today, for the
people have an offering on the high place today. 
1Sam
9:13  “As you come into the city, you are
going to find him before he goes up to the high place to eat. For the people do
not eat until he comes, for he blesses the slaughtering, afterward they who are
invited eat. And now, go up, for you should find him about this time.” 
1Sam
9:14  And they went up to the city. They
were coming into the midst of the city, and saw Shemu’ĕl coming out toward
them to go up to the high place. 
1Sam
9:15  And יהוה
had revealed to Shemu’ĕl in his ear the day before Sha’ul came, saying, 
1Sam
9:16  “At this time tomorrow I shall send
you a man from the land of Binyamin, and you shall anoint him leader over My
people Yisra’ĕl, and he shall save My people from the hand of the
Philistines. For I have seen My people, because their cry has come to me.”
1Sam
9:17  And when Shemu’ĕl saw Sha’ul, יהוה
said to him, “See, the man of whom I spoke to you. Let this one govern My
people.” 
1Sam
9:18  And Sha’ul drew near to Shemu’ĕl
in the gate, and said, “Please inform me, where is the house of the seer?” 
1Sam
9:19  And Shemu’ĕl answered Sha’ul
and said, “I am the seer. Go up before me to the high place, for you shall eat
with me today. And tomorrow I shall let you go and make known to you all that
is in your heart. 
1Sam
9:20  “As for your donkeys that were lost
three days ago, do not set your heart on them, for they have been found. And on
whom is all the desire of Yisra’ĕl? Is it not on you and on all your
father’s house?” 
1Sam
9:21  And Sha’ul answered and said, “Am I
not a Binyamite – of the smallest of the tribes of Yisra’ĕl, and my clan
the least of all the clans of the tribe of Binyamin? Why then do you speak like
this to me?” 
1Sam
9:22  And Shemu’ĕl took Sha’ul and
his servant and brought them into the hall, and gave to them a place at the
head of those who were invited, and there were about thirty men. 
1Sam
9:23  And Shemu’ĕl said to the cook,
“Bring the portion which I gave you, of which I told you to set it aside.” 
1Sam
9:24  And the cook brought out the thigh
with its upper part and set it before Sha’ul. And Shemu’ĕl said, “See what
was kept back. It was set aside for you. Eat, for it has been kept for you for
this appointed time, saying, I have invited the people.” And Sha’ul ate with
Shemu’ĕl on that day. 
1Sam
9:25  And they came down from the high
place into the city, and Shemu’ĕl spoke with Sha’ul on the roof. 
1Sam
9:26  And they rose early. And it came to
be about the dawning of the day that Shemu’ĕl called to Sha’ul on the
roof, saying, “Rise, so that I send you on your way.” And Sha’ul rose, and both
of them went outside, he and Shemu’ĕl. 
1Sam
9:27  As they were walking toward the
edge of the city, Shemu’ĕl said to Sha’ul, “Say to the servant to go on
ahead of us.” And he went on. “But you stand here a moment, so that I let you
hear the word of Elohim.” 
1Sam
10:1  And Shemu’ĕl took a flask of
oil and poured it on his head, and kissed him and said, “Is it not because יהוה
has anointed you leader over His inheritance? 
1Sam
10:2  “When you leave me today, you shall
find two men by Raḥĕl’s tomb in the border of Binyamin at
Tseltsaḥ, and they shall say to you, ‘The donkeys which you went to look
for have been found. And see, your father has left the matters of the donkeys
and is worrying about you, saying, “What shall I do for my son?” ’ 
1Sam
10:3  “And you shall pass on from there,
and beyond, and shall come to the terebinth tree of Taḇor. And three men
going up to Elohim at Bĕyth Ĕl shall find you there, one bearing
three young goats, another bearing three loaves of bread, and another bearing a
skin of wine. 
1Sam
10:4  “And they shall greet you and give
you two loaves of bread, which you shall accept from their hand. 
1Sam
10:5  “After that go to the hill of Elohim
where the Philistine watch-post is. And it shall be, when you have come there
to the city, that you shall meet a group of prophets coming down from the high
place with a stringed instrument, and a tambourine, and a flute, and a lyre
before them, and they are prophesying. 
1Sam
10:6  “And the Spirit of יהוה
shall come upon you, and you shall prophesy with them and be turned into
another man. 
1Sam
10:7  “And it shall be, when these signs
come to you, do for yourself as your hand finds to do, for Elohim is with you. 
1Sam
10:8  “And you shall go down before me to
Gilgal. And see, I am coming down to you to slaughter burnt offerings and make
peace offerings. Wait seven days, till I come to you, then I shall make known
to you what you should do.” 
1Sam
10:9  And it came to be, when he had
turned his back to go from Shemu’ĕl, that Elohim gave him another heart.
And all those signs came on that day. 
1Sam
10:10  And they came there to the hill
and saw a group of prophets, to meet him. And the Spirit of Elohim came upon
him, and he prophesied in their midst. 
1Sam
10:11  And it came to be, all who knew
him formerly looked and saw that he prophesied among the prophets. So the
people said to each other, “What is this that has come upon the son of Qish? Is
Sha’ul also among the prophets?” 
1Sam
10:12  And a man there answered and said,
“And who is their father?” That is why it became a proverb, “Is Sha’ul also
among the prophets?” 
1Sam
10:13  And when he stopped prophesying,
he went to the high place. 
1Sam
10:14  And the uncle of Sha’ul asked him
and his servant, “Where did you go?” And he said, “To look for the donkeys. And
when we saw that they were nowhere to be found, we went to Shemu’ĕl.” 
1Sam
10:15  And the uncle of Sha’ul said, “Please
inform me what Shemu’ĕl said to you.” 
1Sam
10:16  And Sha’ul said to his uncle, “He
informed us plainly that the donkeys had been found.” But he did not disclose
to him about the matter of the reign, what Shemu’ĕl had said. 
1Sam
10:17  And Shemu’ĕl called the
people together to יהוה at Mitspah, 
1Sam
10:18  and said to the children of Yisra’ĕl,
“Thus said יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, ‘I have
brought Yisra’ĕl up out of Mitsrayim, and delivered you from the hand of
the Mitsrites and from the hand of all reigns and from those who oppressed you.’
1Sam
10:19  “And today you have rejected your
Elohim, who Himself saved you out of all your evils and your distresses. And
you have said to Him, ‘No, but set a sovereign over us!’ And now, present
yourselves before יהוה by your tribes and by your
clans.” 
1Sam
10:20  And Shemu’ĕl brought near all
the tribes of Yisra’ĕl, and the tribe of Binyamin was taken. 
1Sam
10:21  Then he brought near the tribe of
Binyamin, by their clans, and the clan of Matri was taken, and Sha’ul son of
Qish was taken. And when they sought him, he could not be found. 
1Sam
10:22  And they asked again of יהוה,
“Has the man come here yet?” And יהוה answered, “See,
he has hidden by the baggage.” 
1Sam
10:23  And they ran and brought him from
there. And he stood in the midst of the people, and he was taller than any of
the people, from his shoulders and upwards. 
1Sam
10:24  And Shemu’ĕl said to all the
people, “Do you see him whom יהוה has chosen, that
there is no one like him among all the people?” And all the people shouted and
said, “Let the sovereign live!” 
1Sam
10:25  And Shemu’ĕl declared to the
people the rulings of the reign, and wrote it in a book and placed it before יהוה.
And Shemu’ĕl sent all the people away, each to his house.
1Sam
10:26  And Sha’ul went to his house too,
to Giḇ‛ah. And with him went brave men whose hearts Elohim had
touched. 
1Sam
10:27  But the sons of Beliya‛al
said, “What! Does this one save us?” And they despised him, and brought him no
presents. But he kept silent. 
1Sam
11:1  And Naḥash the Ammonite came
up and camped against Yaḇĕsh Gil‛aḏ. And all the men of
Yaḇĕsh said to Naḥash, “Make a covenant with us, and we shall
serve you.” 
1Sam
11:2  Then Naḥash the Ammonite
answered them, “For this I make a covenant with you, that I dig out all your
right eyes, and I shall bring reproach on all Yisra’ĕl.” 
1Sam
11:3  And the elders of Yaḇĕsh
said to him, “Leave us alone for seven days, so that we send messengers to all
the borders of Yisra’ĕl. And then, if there is no one to save us, we shall
come out to you.” 
1Sam
11:4  And the messengers came to Giḇ‛ah
of Sha’ul and spoke the words in the hearing of the people. And all the people
lifted up their voices and wept. 
1Sam
11:5  And look, Sha’ul was coming behind
the herd from the field. And Sha’ul said, “Why are the people weeping?” And
they related to him the words of the men of Yaḇĕsh.
1Sam
11:6  And the Spirit of Elohim came upon
Sha’ul mightily as he heard these words, and his displeasure burned greatly. 
1Sam
11:7  And he took a yoke of cattle and
cut them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the border of Yisra’ĕl by
the hands of messengers, saying, “Whoever does not go out with Sha’ul and Shemu’ĕl
to battle, let this be done to his cattle.” And the fear of יהוה
fell on the people, and they came out as one man. 
1Sam
11:8  And he mustered them in Bezeq, and
the children of Yisra’ĕl were three hundred thousand, and the men of Yehuḏah
thirty thousand. 
1Sam
11:9  And they said to the messengers who
came, “Say this to the men of Yaḇĕsh Gil‛aḏ, ‘Tomorrow,
by the time the sun is hot, you shall have help.’ ” Then the messengers came
and informed the men of Yaḇĕsh, and they rejoiced. 
1Sam
11:10  So the men of Yaḇĕsh
said, “Tomorrow we come out to you, and you shall do to us whatever seems good
to you.”
1Sam
11:11  And it came to be, on the next
day, that Sha’ul put the people in three companies. And they came into the
midst of the camp in the morning watch and smote Ammon until the heat of the
day. And it came to be that those left were scattered, so that no two of them
were left together. 
1Sam
11:12  And the people said to Shemu’ĕl,
“Who said, ‘Shall Sha’ul reign over us?’ Bring the men, so that we put them to
death.” 
1Sam
11:13  But Sha’ul said, “No man is put to
death this day, for today יהוה has wrought deliverance
in Yisra’ĕl.” 
1Sam
11:14  And Shemu’ĕl said to the
people, “Come, and let us go to Gilgal and renew the reign there.” 
1Sam
11:15  And all the people went to Gilgal,
and there they set up Sha’ul to reign before יהוה in
Gilgal, and there they made slaughterings of peace offerings before יהוה.
And there Sha’ul rejoiced, and all the men of Yisra’ĕl, very greatly. 
1Sam
12:1  And Shemu’ĕl said to all Yisra’ĕl,
“Look, I have listened to your voice in all that you said to me, and have set a
sovereign over you. 
1Sam
12:2  “And now, look, the sovereign is
walking before you. And I am old and grey, and look, my sons are with you. And
I have walked before you from my youth to this day. 
1Sam
12:3  “Look, here I am. Witness against
me before יהוה and before His anointed: Whose ox have I
taken, or whose donkey have I taken, or whom have I oppressed? Whom have I
abused, or from whose hand have I received any bribe with which to blind my
eyes? – then I restore it to you.” 
1Sam
12:4  And they said, “You have not
oppressed us or abused us, nor have you taken any bribe from anyone’s hand.” 
1Sam
12:5  So he said to them, “ יהוה
is witness against you, and His anointed is witness today, that you have found
naught in my hand.” And they answered, “He is witness.” 
1Sam
12:6  And Shemu’ĕl said to the
people, “It is יהוה who appointed Mosheh and Aharon,
and who brought your fathers up from the land of Mitsrayim. 
1Sam
12:7  “And now, stand still, so that I
judge you before יהוה concerning all the righteous acts
of יהוה which He did to you and your fathers: 
1Sam
12:8  “When Ya‛aqoḇ had come
to Mitsrayim, and your fathers cried out to יהוה, then יהוה
sent Mosheh and Aharon, who brought your fathers out of Mitsrayim and made them
dwell in this place. 
1Sam
12:9  “But they forgot יהוה
their Elohim, so He sold them into the hand of Sisera, commander of the army of
Ḥatsor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the
sovereign of Mo’aḇ. And they fought against them. 
1Sam
12:10  “And they cried out to יהוה,
and said, ‘We have sinned, because we have forsaken יהוה
and served the Ba‛als and the Ashtaroth. And now, deliver us from the
hand of our enemies, and we serve You.’ 
1Sam
12:11  “And יהוה
sent Yerubba‛al, and Beḏan, and Yiphtaḥ, and Shemu’ĕl,
and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies round about, and you dwelt in
safety. 
1Sam
12:12  “And when you saw that
Naḥash sovereign of the children of Ammon came against you, you said to
me, ‘No, but let a sovereign reign over us,’ when יהוה
your Elohim was your sovereign.
1Sam
12:13  “And now, here is the sovereign
whom you have chosen and whom you have asked. And see, יהוה
has set a sovereign over you. 
1Sam
12:14  “If you fear יהוה,
and shall serve Him and obey His voice, and not rebel against the command of יהוה,
then both you and the sovereign who reigns over you shall follow יהוה
your Elohim. 
1Sam
12:15  “But if you do not obey the voice
of יהוה, and shall rebel against the command of יהוה,
then the hand of יהוה shall be against you, as it was
against your fathers. 
1Sam
12:16  “And now, stand and see this great
matter which יהוה does before your eyes: 
1Sam
12:17  “Is today not the wheat harvest?
Let me call to יהוה, so that He sends thunder and rain –
know then and see that your evil is great, which you have done in the eyes of יהוה,
in asking for yourselves a sovereign.” 
1Sam
12:18  And Shemu’ĕl called to יהוה,
and יהוה sent thunder and rain that day. And all the
people greatly feared יהוה and Shemu’ĕl. 
1Sam
12:19  And all the people said to Shemu’ĕl,
“Pray for your servants to יהוה your Elohim, that we do
not die, for we have added to all our sins this
evil of asking for ourselves a sovereign.” 
1Sam
12:20  And Shemu’ĕl said to the
people, “Do not fear. You have done all this evil. Only, do not turn aside from
following יהוה. And you shall serve יהוה
with all your heart, 
1Sam
12:21  and do not turn aside after
worthless matters which do not profit
or deliver, for they are worthless. 
1Sam
12:22  “For יהוה
would not cast away His people, for His great Name’s sake, seeing it has
pleased יהוה to make you His people.
1Sam
12:23  “Also, as for me, far be it from
me that I should sin against יהוה in ceasing to pray
for you, but I shall teach you the good and straight way. 
1Sam
12:24  “Only fear יהוה,
and you shall serve Him in truth with all your heart, for consider what marvels
He has done for you. 
1Sam
12:25  “But if you persist in doing evil,
both you and your sovereign are consumed.” 
1Sam
13:1  Sha’ul was ... years old when he
began to reign. And when he had reigned two years over Yisra’ĕl, 
1Sam
13:2  Sha’ul chose for himself three
thousand men of Yisra’ĕl. And two thousand were with Sha’ul in Miḵmash
and in the mountains of Bĕyth Ĕl, and a thousand were with Yonathan
in Giḇ‛ah of Binyamin. And the rest of the people he sent away,
each to his tent. 
1Sam
13:3  And Yonathan smote the watch-post
of the Philistines that was in Geḇa, and the Philistines heard of it. And
Sha’ul blew the ram’s horn throughout all the land, saying, “Let the Heḇrews
hear!” 
1Sam
13:4  And all Yisra’ĕl heard the
news that Sha’ul had smitten a watch-post of the Philistines, and also that
Yisra’ĕl had become a stench to the Philistines. And the people were
summoned to Sha’ul at Gilgal.
1Sam
13:5  And the Philistines gathered to
fight Yisra’ĕl, thirty thousand chariots and six thousand horsemen, and
people as numerous as the sand on the seashore. And they came up and encamped
in Miḵmash, east of Bĕyth Awen. 
1Sam
13:6  And the men of Yisra’ĕl saw
that they were in trouble, for the people were distressed, and the people hid
in caves, and in thorny bushes, and in rocks, and in holes, and in pits. 
1Sam
13:7  And some Heḇrews passed over the Yardĕn to the land of Gaḏ
and Gil‛aḏ. But Sha’ul was still in Gilgal, and all the people
followed him, trembling. 
1Sam
13:8  And he waited for seven days,
according to the appointment with Shemu’ĕl. But Shemu’ĕl did not come
to Gilgal, and the people were scattered from him. 
1Sam
13:9  And Sha’ul said, “Bring a burnt
offering and peace offerings here to me.” And he offered the burnt offering. 
1Sam
13:10  And it came to be, as he had
finished offering the burnt offering, look, Shemu’ĕl came. And Sha’ul went
out to meet him, to bless him. 
1Sam
13:11  Then Shemu’ĕl said, “What
have you done?” And Sha’ul said, “Because I saw that the people were scattered
from me, and that you did not come within the days appointed, and that the
Philistines gathered at Miḵmash, 
1Sam
13:12  so I said, ‘The Philistines are
going to come down on me at Gilgal, and I have not appeased the face of יהוה.’
So I felt compelled, and offered a burnt offering.” 
1Sam
13:13  And Shemu’ĕl said to Sha’ul, “You
have been foolish. You have not guarded the command of יהוה
your Elohim, which He commanded you. For now יהוה would
have established your reign over Yisra’ĕl forever. 
1Sam
13:14  “But now, your reign is not going
to stand. יהוה shall seek for Himself a man after His own
heart, and יהוה shall command him to be leader over His
people, because you have not guarded what יהוה
commanded you.”
1Sam
13:15  And Shemu’ĕl arose and went
up from Gilgal to Giḇ‛ah of Binyamin. And Sha’ul mustered the
people who were present with him, about six hundred men. 
1Sam
13:16  And Sha’ul, and Yonathan his son,
and the people who were present with them remained in Giḇ‛ah of
Binyamin, while the Philistines camped at Miḵmash. 
1Sam
13:17  And from the camp of the
Philistines raiders went out in three companies. The one company turned to the
way that leads to Ophrah, to the land of Shu‛al, 
1Sam
13:18  and another company turned toward
the way of Bĕyth Ḥoron, and another company turned toward the way of
the border that overlooks the Valley of Tseḇo‛im toward the
wilderness. 
1Sam
13:19  Now no blacksmith could be found
in all the land of Yisra’ĕl, for the Philistines said, “Lest the Heḇrews
make swords or spears.” 
1Sam
13:20  And all Yisra’ĕl went down to
the Philistines, each one to sharpen his ploughshare, and his mattock, and his
axe, and his sickle. 
1Sam
13:21  And the charge was a pim for the
ploughshares, and the mattocks, and the forks, and the axes, and to set the
points of the goads.
1Sam
13:22  And it came to be, on the day of
battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the
people who were with Sha’ul and Yonathan. But they were found with Sha’ul and
Yonathan his son. 
1Sam
13:23  And the outpost of the Philistines
went out to the pass of Miḵmash. 
1Sam
14:1  And it came to be one day that
Yonathan son of Sha’ul said to the young man who bore his armour, “Come, and
let us go over to the outpost of the Philistines which is on the other side.”
But he did not inform his father. 
1Sam
14:2  And Sha’ul remained at the
outskirts of Giḇ‛ah under a pomegranate tree at Miḡron, and
the people who were with him were about six hundred men. 
1Sam
14:3  And Aḥiyah son of Aḥituḇ,
Iḵaḇoḏ’s brother, son of Pineḥas, son of Ĕli, the
priest of יהוה in Shiloh, was wearing a shoulder
garment. And the people did not know that Yonathan had gone. 
1Sam
14:4  And between the passes, by which
Yonathan sought to go over to the outpost of the Philistines, there was an edge
of a rock on one side and an edge of a rock on the other side. And the name of
one was Botsĕts, and the name of the other Seneh. 
1Sam
14:5  The one edge was on the north
opposite Miḵmash, and the other on the south opposite Giḇ‛ah.

1Sam
14:6  And Yehonathan said to the young
man who bore his armour, “Come, and let us go over to the outpost of these
uncircumcised. If so be, יהוה does work for us. For
there is no hindrance for יהוה to save by many or by
few.”
1Sam
14:7  And his armour-bearer said to him, “Do
all that is in your heart, incline yourself. See, I am with you, according to
your heart.” 
1Sam
14:8  And Yehonathan said, “See, we are
passing over to the men – and show ourselves to them. 
1Sam
14:9  “If they say this to us, ‘Wait
until we come to you,’ then we shall stand still in our place and not go up to
them. 
1Sam
14:10  “But if they say this, ‘Come up to
us,’ then we shall go up. For יהוה has given them into
our hand, and this is the sign to us.” 
1Sam
14:11  And both of them disclosed
themselves to the outpost of the Philistines, and the Philistines said, “See,
the Heḇrews are coming out of the holes where they have hidden.” 
1Sam
14:12  And the men of the outpost called
to Yonathan and his armour-bearer, and said, “Come up to us, and let us teach
you a lesson.” Then Yonathan said to his armour-bearer, “Come up after me, for יהוה
has given them into the hand of Yisra’ĕl.” 
1Sam
14:13  And Yonathan climbed up on his
hands and knees with his armour-bearer after him. And they fell before
Yonathan, and his armour-bearer was putting them to death behind him. 
1Sam
14:14  And that first slaughter which
Yonathan and his armour-bearer made was about twenty men, in about half an acre
of land. 
1Sam
14:15  And there was trembling in the
camp, in the field, and among all the people. The outpost and the raiders also
trembled, and the ground shook. And it became a trembling of Elohim. 
1Sam
14:16  And the watchmen of Sha’ul in Giḇ‛ah
of Binyamin looked and saw the crowd melting away, and they went here and
there. 
1Sam
14:17  And Sha’ul said to the people who
were with him, “Please inspect and see who has gone from us.” So they inspected
and saw that Yonathan and his armour-bearer were missing. 
1Sam
14:18  And Sha’ul said to Aḥiyah, “Bring
the ark of Elohim here.” For the ark of Elohim was with the children of Yisra’ĕl
on that day. 
1Sam
14:19  And it came to be, while Sha’ul
talked to the priest, that the noise which was in the camp of the Philistines
went on, and became great, so Sha’ul said to the priest, “Withdraw your hand.” 
1Sam
14:20  And Sha’ul was called, and all the
people who were with him , and they went to the battle. And see, every man’s
sword was against his neighbour – a very great confusion. 
1Sam
14:21  And the Heḇrews who were
with the Philistines before that time, who went up with them into the camp,
turned round, they too, to be with Yisra’ĕl, who were with Sha’ul and
Yonathan. 
1Sam
14:22  And all the men of Yisra’ĕl
who had hidden in the mountains of Ephrayim, heard that the Philistines fled,
and they also pursued them in the battle. 
1Sam
14:23  Thus יהוה
saved Yisra’ĕl that day, and the battle passed over to Bĕyth Awen. 
1Sam
14:24  And the men of Yisra’ĕl were
distressed that day, for Sha’ul had placed the people under oath, saying, “Cursed
be the man who eats food until evening, and I have taken revenge on my enemies.”
Therefore none of the people tasted food.
1Sam
14:25  And all they of the land came into the woods, and there was honey on the
ground. 
1Sam
14:26  And the people came into the woods
and saw the honey, dripping. But no one put his hand to his mouth, for the
people feared the oath. 
1Sam
14:27  But Yonathan had not heard that
his father had taken an oath of the people, and he stretched out the end of the
rod that was in his hand and dipped it in a honeycomb, and put his hand to his
mouth. And his eyes lit up. 
1Sam
14:28  Then one of the people said, “Your
father strictly took an oath of the people, saying, ‘Cursed be the man who eats
food today.’ ” And the people were weary. 
1Sam
14:29  And Yonathan said, “My father has
troubled the land. Now see how my eyes lit up when I tasted a little of this
honey. 
1Sam
14:30  “How much better if the people had
well eaten today of the spoil of their enemies which they found! For then,
would not the slaughter among the Philistines have been greater?” 
1Sam
14:31  And they smote the Philistines
that day from Miḵmash to Ayalon. So the people were very weary, 
1Sam
14:32  and the people pounced on the
spoil, and took sheep, and cattle, and calves, and slaughtered them on the
ground. And the people ate with the blood. 
1Sam
14:33  And they told Sha’ul, saying, “Look,
the people are sinning against יהוה by eating with the
blood!” And he said, “You have acted treacherously. Roll a large stone to me
today.” 
1Sam
14:34  And Sha’ul said, “Scatter among
the people, and say to them, ‘Each one bring his ox near to me, and each one
his sheep, and you shall slaughter them here, and eat. And do not sin against יהוה
by eating with the blood.’ ” So every one of the people brought his ox with him
that night, and slaughtered it there. 
1Sam
14:35  And Sha’ul built an altar to יהוה.
It was the first altar he built to יהוה.
1Sam
14:36  And Sha’ul said, “Let us go down
after the Philistines by night, and plunder them until the morning light, and
not leave a man of them.” And they said, “Do whatever seems good to you.” But
the priest said, “Let us draw near to Elohim here.” 
1Sam
14:37  And Sha’ul asked of Elohim, “Should
I go down after the Philistines? Do You give them into the hand of Yisra’ĕl?”
But He did not answer him that day. 
1Sam
14:38  And Sha’ul said, “Come over here,
all you chiefs of the people, and know and see what this sin was today. 
1Sam
14:39  “For as יהוה
lives, who saves Yisra’ĕl, though it be in Yonathan my son, he shall
certainly die.” But not one among all the people answered him. 
1Sam
14:40  And he said to all Yisra’ĕl, “You
be on one side, and my son Yonathan and I be on the other side.” And the people
said to Sha’ul, “Do what seems good to you.” 
1Sam
14:41  Then Sha’ul said to יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, “Give a perfect lot.”
And Sha’ul and Yonathan were taken, but the people escaped. 
1Sam
14:42  And Sha’ul said, “Cast lots between my son Yonathan and me.”
And Yonathan was taken. 
1Sam
14:43  Sha’ul then said to Yonathan, “Explain
to me what you have done.” And Yonathan explained to him, and said, “I only
tasted a little honey with the end of the rod that was in my hand. See, let me
die!” 
1Sam
14:44  And Sha’ul answered, “Elohim do so
and more also, for you shall certainly die, Yonathan.” 
1Sam
14:45  But the people said to Sha’ul, “Should
Yonathan die, who has wrought this great deliverance in Yisra’ĕl? Far be
it! As יהוה lives, let not one hair of his head fall to
the ground, for he has wrought with Elohim this day.” Thus the people delivered
Yonathan, and he did not die. 
1Sam
14:46  And Sha’ul returned from pursuing
the Philistines, and the Philistines went to their own place. 
1Sam
14:47  And Sha’ul took the reign over
Yisra’ĕl, and fought against all his enemies round about, against Mo’aḇ,
and against the children of Ammon, and against Eḏom, and against the
sovereigns of Tsoḇah, and against the Philistines. And wherever he
turned, he inflicted punishment. 
1Sam
14:48  And he gathered an army and smote
the Amalĕqites, and delivered Yisra’ĕl from the hands of those who
plundered them. 
1Sam
14:49  And the sons of Sha’ul were
Yonathan and Yishwi and Malkishua. And the names of his two daughters were
these: the name of the first-born Mĕraḇ, and the name of the younger
Miḵal.
1Sam
14:50  And the name of Sha’ul’s wife was
Aḥino‛am the daughter of Aḥima‛ats. And the name of the
commander of his army was Aḇnĕr son of Nĕr, uncle of Sha’ul.’ 
1Sam
14:51  And Qish was the father of Sha’ul,
and Nĕr the father of Aḇnĕr was the son of Aḇi’ĕl. 
1Sam
14:52  And there was fierce fighting
against the Philistines all the days of Sha’ul. And when Sha’ul saw any mighty
man or any brave man, he took him for himself. 
1Sam
15:1  And Shemu’ĕl said to Sha’ul, “
יהוה sent me to anoint you sovereign over His people,
over Yisra’ĕl. And now, listen to the voice of the words of יהוה.

1Sam
15:2  “Thus said יהוה
of hosts, ‘I shall punish Amalĕq for what he did to Yisra’ĕl, how he
set himself against him on the way when he came up from Mitsrayim. 
1Sam
15:3  ‘Now go, and you shall smite Amalĕq
and put under the ban all that he has, and you shall not spare them, and put to
death from man to woman, from infant to nursing child, from ox to sheep, from
camel to donkey.’ ” 
1Sam
15:4  Then Sha’ul summoned the people and
mustered them in Tela’im, two hundred thousand foot soldiers and ten thousand
men of Yehuḏah. 
1Sam
15:5  And Sha’ul came to a city of Amalĕq,
and lay in wait in the wadi. 
1Sam
15:6  And Sha’ul said to the Qĕynites,
“Go, turn aside, come down from among the Amalĕqites, lest I destroy you
with them. For you did show kindness to all the children of Yisra’ĕl when
they came up out of Mitsrayim.” So the Qĕynites turned aside from the
midst of the Amalĕqites. 
1Sam
15:7  And Sha’ul smote the Amalĕqites,
from Ḥawilah all the way to Shur, which is before Mitsrayim. 
1Sam
15:8  And he caught Aḡaḡ
sovereign of the Amalĕqites alive, and put under the ban all the people
with the edge of the sword. 
1Sam
15:9  But Sha’ul and the people spared Aḡaḡ
and the best of the sheep, and the cattle, and the fatlings, and the lambs, and
all that was good, and would not put them under the ban. But all goods despised
and worthless, that they put under the ban. 
1Sam
15:10  And the word of יהוה
came to Shemu’ĕl, saying, 
1Sam
15:11  “I am grieved that I have set up
Sha’ul as sovereign, for he has turned back from following Me, and has not
performed My words.” And it displeased Shemu’ĕl, and he cried to יהוה
all night. 
1Sam
15:12  And Shemu’ĕl rose early in
the morning to meet Sha’ul, and it was told to Shemu’ĕl, saying, “Sha’ul
went to Karmel, and see, he set up a monument for himself, then turned and
passed over, and went down to Gilgal.” 
1Sam
15:13  And Shemu’ĕl came to Sha’ul,
and Sha’ul said to him, “Blessed are you of יהוה ! I
have performed the word of יהוה.” 
1Sam
15:14  But Shemu’ĕl said, “What then
is this bleating of the sheep in my ears, and the lowing of the cattle which I
hear?” 
1Sam
15:15  And Sha’ul said, “They have
brought them from Amalĕq, because the people spared the best of the sheep
and the cattle, to slaughter to יהוה your Elohim. And
the rest we have put under the ban.” 
1Sam
15:16  And Shemu’ĕl said to Sha’ul, “Wait,
and let me declare to you what יהוה said to me last
night.” And he said to him, “Speak.” 
1Sam
15:17  And Shemu’ĕl said, “Though
you were little in your own eyes, were you not head of the tribes of Yisra’ĕl?
And did not יהוה anoint you sovereign over Yisra’ĕl?

1Sam
15:18  “And יהוה
sent you on the way, and said, ‘Go, and you shall put under the ban the
sinners, the Amalĕqites, and fight against them until they are consumed.’ 
1Sam
15:19  “And why did you not obey the
voice of יהוה, but swooped down on the spoil, and did
evil in the eyes of יהוה ?” 
1Sam
15:20  And Sha’ul said to Shemu’ĕl, “I
did obey the voice of יהוה, and I went on the way on
which יהוה sent me, and brought back Aḡaḡ
sovereign of Amalĕq, and I put Amalĕq under the ban. 
1Sam
15:21  “But the people took of the spoil,
of the sheep and cattle, the best of that which should have been put under the
ban, to slaughter to יהוה your Elohim in Gilgal.” 
1Sam
15:22  Then Shemu’ĕl said, “Does יהוה
delight in burnt offerings and slaughterings, as in obeying the voice of יהוה
? Look, to obey is better than an
offering, to heed is better than the fat of rams. 
1Sam
15:23  “For rebellion is as the sin of
divination, and stubbornness is as wickedness and idolatry. Because you have
rejected the word of יהוה, He also does reject you as
sovereign.” 
1Sam
15:24  And Sha’ul said to Shemu’ĕl, “I
have sinned, for I have transgressed the command of יהוה
and your words, because I feared the people and listened to their voice. 
1Sam
15:25  “And now, please pardon my sin,
and return with me, and let me bow myself to יהוה.” 
1Sam
15:26  But Shemu’ĕl said to Sha’ul, “I
do not return with you, for you have rejected the word of יהוה,
and יהוה does reject you from being sovereign over
Yisra’ĕl.” 
1Sam
15:27  And as Shemu’ĕl turned around
to go away, Sha’ul seized the edge of
his robe, and it tore. 
1Sam
15:28  And Shemu’ĕl said to him, “ יהוה
has torn the reign of Yisra’ĕl from you today, and has given it to a
neighbour of yours, better than you. 
1Sam
15:29  “Moreover, the Eminence of Yisra’ĕl
does not lie nor relent. For He is not a man, that He should relent.” 
1Sam
15:30  Then he said, “I have sinned. But
esteem me now, please, before the elders of my people and before Yisra’ĕl,
and return with me, and I shall bow myself to יהוה your
Elohim.”
1Sam
15:31  And Shemu’ĕl turned back
after Sha’ul, and Sha’ul bowed himself to יהוה. 
1Sam
15:32  And Shemu’ĕl said, “Bring Aḡaḡ
sovereign of the Amalĕqites here to me.” So Aḡaḡ came to him
delightedly, and Aḡaḡ said, “Truly, the bitterness of death has
turned aside.” 
1Sam
15:33  And Shemu’ĕl said, “As your
sword bereaved women, let your mother be bereaved among women too.” Shemu’ĕl
then hewed Aḡaḡ to pieces before יהוה in
Gilgal. 
1Sam
15:34  And Shemu’ĕl went to Ramah,
while Sha’ul went up to his house at Giḇ‛ah of Sha’ul. 
1Sam
15:35  And Shemu’ĕl did not see Sha’ul
again until the day of his death, for Shemu’ĕl mourned for Sha’ul. And יהוה
was grieved that He had made Sha’ul to reign over Yisra’ĕl. 
1Sam
16:1  And יהוה
said to Shemu’ĕl, “How long are you going to mourn for Sha’ul, seeing I
have rejected him from reigning over Yisra’ĕl? Fill your horn with oil,
and go, I am sending you to Yishai the Bĕyth Leḥemite. For I have
seen among his sons a sovereign for Myself.” 
1Sam
16:2  And Shemu’ĕl said, “How would
I go? When Sha’ul hears it, he shall kill me.” And יהוה
said, “Take a heifer with you, and say, ‘I have come to slaughter to יהוה.’

1Sam
16:3  “And you shall invite Yishai to the
slaughtering, then let Me show you what to do. And you shall anoint for Me the
one I say to you.” 
1Sam
16:4  And Shemu’ĕl did what יהוה
said, and went to Bĕyth Leḥem. And the elders of the town trembled
at his coming, and said, “Do you come in peace?” 
1Sam
16:5  And he said, “In peace. I have come
to slaughter to יהוה. Set yourselves apart, and you
shall come with me to the slaughtering.” And he set Yishai and his sons apart,
and invited them to the slaughtering. 
1Sam
16:6  And it came to be, when they came,
that he saw Eliyaḇ and thought, “The anointed of יהוה
is indeed before Him.” 
1Sam
16:7  But יהוה
said to Shemu’ĕl, “Do not look at his appearance or at the height of his
stature, because I have refused him, for not as man sees, for man looks at the
eyes, but יהוה looks at the heart.” 
1Sam
16:8  Then Yishai called Aḇinaḏaḇ,
and made him pass before Shemu’ĕl. And he said, “Neither has יהוה
chosen this one.” 
1Sam
16:9  Next Yishai made Shammah pass by.
And he said, “Neither has יהוה chosen this one.” 
1Sam
16:10  And Yishai made seven of his sons
pass before Shemu’ĕl. And Shemu’ĕl said to Yishai, “ יהוה
has not chosen these.” 
1Sam
16:11  And Shemu’ĕl said to Yishai, “Are
these all the young men?” And he said, “There remains yet the youngest, and
see, he is tending the sheep.” And Shemu’ĕl said to Yishai, “Send and
bring him, for we do not turn round till he comes here.” 
1Sam
16:12  And he sent and brought him in.
And he was ruddy, with bright eyes, and good-looking. And יהוה
said, “Arise, anoint him, for this is the one!” 
1Sam
16:13  And Shemu’ĕl took the horn of
oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers. And the Spirit of יהוה
came upon Dawiḏ from that day and onwards. And Shemu’ĕl arose and
went to Ramah. 
1Sam
16:14  And the Spirit of יהוה
turned aside from Sha’ul, and an evil spirit from יהוה
troubled him. 
1Sam
16:15  And the servants of Sha’ul said to
him, “Look, now, an evil spirit from Elohim is troubling you. 
1Sam
16:16  “Please, let our master command
your servants who are before you, to seek out a man who is a skilled player on
the lyre. And it shall be that when the evil spirit from Elohim is upon you,
that he shall play with his hand, and you be well.”
1Sam
16:17  And Sha’ul said to his servants, “Please
get me a man that plays well, and bring him to me.” 
1Sam
16:18  And one of the servants answered
and said, “Look, I have seen a son of Yishai the Bĕyth Leḥemite, who
knows how to play, a brave one, and a man of battle, and skilled in words, and
a handsome man. And יהוה is with him.” 
1Sam
16:19  So Sha’ul sent messengers to
Yishai, and said, “Send me your son Dawiḏ, who is with the sheep.” 
1Sam
16:20  And Yishai took a donkey loaded
with bread, and a skin of wine, and a young goat, and sent them by his son Dawiḏ
to Sha’ul. 
1Sam
16:21  And Dawiḏ came to Sha’ul and
stood before him. And he loved him greatly, and he became his armour-bearer. 
1Sam
16:22  Sha’ul therefore sent to Yishai,
saying, “Please let Dawiḏ stand before me, for he has found favour in my
eyes.” 
1Sam
16:23  And it came to be, whenever the evil spirit from Elohim was upon Sha’ul,
that Dawiḏ would take a lyre and play it with his hand. Then Sha’ul would
become refreshed and well, and the evil spirit would leave him. 
1Sam
17:1  And the Philistines had gathered
their armies for battle, and came together at Soḵoh, which belongs to
Yehuḏah, and encamped between Soḵoh and Azĕqah, in Ephes
Dammim. 
1Sam
17:2  And Sha’ul and the men of Yisra’ĕl
were gathered and encamped in the Valley of Ĕlah, and drew up in battle
array to meet the Philistines. 
1Sam
17:3  And the Philistines stood on a
mountain on one side, and Yisra’ĕl stood on a mountain on the other side,
with the valley between them. 
1Sam
17:4  Then a champion came out from the
camp of the Philistines, named Golyath, from Gath, whose height was six cubits
and a span. 
1Sam
17:5  And a bronze helmet was on his
head, and he was armed with a scaled armour, and the weight of the coat was
five thousand sheqels of bronze, 
1Sam
17:6  and bronze shin guards on his legs
and a bronze spear between his shoulders. 
1Sam
17:7  And the wood of his spear was like
a weaver’s beam, and his iron spearhead weighed
six hundred sheqels, and a shield-bearer went before him. 
1Sam
17:8  And he stood and shouted to the
armies of Yisra’ĕl, and said to them, “Why have you come out to line up
for battle? Am I not a Philistine, and you the servants of Sha’ul? Choose a man
for yourselves, and let him come down to me. 
1Sam
17:9  “If he is able to fight with me,
and shall smite me, then we shall be your servants. But if I overcome him and
shall smite him, then you shall be our servants and serve us.” 
1Sam
17:10  Then the Philistine said, “This
day I shall reproach the armies of Yisra’ĕl. Give me a man, and let us
fight together.” 
1Sam
17:11  And Sha’ul and all Yisra’ĕl
heard these words of the Philistine, and they were broken down and in great
fear. 
1Sam
17:12  Now Dawiḏ was the son of
that Ephrathite of Bĕyth Leḥem in Yehuḏah, whose name was
Yishai, and he had eight sons, and in the days of Sha’ul the man was old among
men. 
1Sam
17:13  And the three oldest sons of
Yishai went, they had gone to follow Sha’ul to the battle, and the names of his
three sons who went to the battle were Eliyaḇ the first-born, and his
second Aḇinaḏaḇ, and the third Shammah. 
1Sam
17:14  And Dawiḏ was the youngest.
And the three oldest followed Sha’ul, 
1Sam
17:15  but Dawiḏ went and returned
from Sha’ul to feed his father’s sheep at Bĕyth Leḥem. 
1Sam
17:16  And for forty days the Philistine
drew near, morning and evening, and took his stand. 
1Sam
17:17  Then Yishai said to his son Dawiḏ,
“Please take to your brothers an ĕphah of this dried grain and these ten
loaves, and run to your brothers at the camp. 
1Sam
17:18  “And take these ten cheeses to the
commander of the thousand, and see how your brothers are, and bring back news
of them.” 
1Sam
17:19  For Sha’ul and they and all the
men of Yisra’ĕl were in the Valley of Ĕlah, fighting with the
Philistines. 
1Sam
17:20  And Dawiḏ rose up early in
the morning, and left the sheep with a herdsman, and took and went as Yishai
had commanded him. And he came to the camp as the army was going out to the
fight, and they shouted for the battle. 
1Sam
17:21  And Yisra’ĕl and the
Philistines drew up in battle array, army against army. 
1Sam
17:22  And Dawiḏ left his supplies
in the hand of the keeper of the supplies, and ran to the army, and came and greeted
his brothers. 
1Sam
17:23  And he was speaking with them and
saw the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Golyath by name, coming up from the
armies of the Philistines. And he spoke according to the same words, and Dawiḏ
heard. 
1Sam
17:24  And all the men of Yisra’ĕl,
when they saw the man, ran from him and were in great fear. 
1Sam
17:25  And the men of Yisra’ĕl said,
“Have you seen this man who has come up? For he has come up to reproach Yisra’ĕl.
And it shall be that the man who smites him, the sovereign is going to enrich
him with great riches, and give him his daughter, and give his father’s house
exemption in Yisra’ĕl.” 
1Sam
17:26  And Dawiḏ spoke to the men
who stood by him, saying, “What shall be done for the man who smites this
Philistine and shall take away reproach from Yisra’ĕl? For who is this
uncircumcised Philistine, that he should reproach the armies of the living
Elohim?” 
1Sam
17:27  And the people answered him
according to this word, saying, “This is what is done for the man who smites
him.” 
1Sam
17:28  And Eliyaḇ his oldest
brother heard when he spoke to the men. And Eliyaḇ’s displeasure burned
against Dawiḏ, and he said, “Why did you come down here? And with whom
have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your pride and the evil
of your heart, for you have come down to see the battle.” 
1Sam
17:29  And Dawiḏ said, “Now what
have I done? Was it not but a word?” 
1Sam
17:30  And he turned around from him
toward another and said the same word. And these people answered him a word
like the first word. 
1Sam
17:31  And when the words which Dawiḏ
spoke were heard, they reported them to Sha’ul, and he sent for him. 
1Sam
17:32  And Dawiḏ said to Sha’ul, “Let
no man’s heart fail because of him, your servant is going, and shall fight with
this Philistine.” 
1Sam
17:33  And Sha’ul said to Dawiḏ, “You
are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him, for you are but a
youth, and he a man of battle from his youth.” 
1Sam
17:34  Then Dawiḏ said to Sha’ul, “Your
servant has been tending sheep for his father, and when a lion or a bear came
and took a lamb out of the flock, 
1Sam
17:35  I went out after it and smote it,
and rescued it from its mouth. And when it rose against me, I caught it by its
beard, and smote it and killed it. 
1Sam
17:36  “Your servant has smitten both
lion and bear. And this uncircumcised Philistine shall be like one of them,
seeing he has reproached the armies of the living Elohim.” 
1Sam
17:37  And Dawiḏ said, “ יהוה,
who delivered me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear, He does
deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.” And Sha’ul said to Dawiḏ, “Go,
and יהוה be with you!” 
1Sam
17:38  And Sha’ul dressed Dawiḏ
with his garments, and he put a bronze helmet on his head, and put a coat of
armour on him. 
1Sam
17:39  And Dawiḏ girded his sword
over his garments, and began to go, but he had not tried them. Then Dawiḏ
said to Sha’ul, “I am not able to go with these, for I have not tried them.” So
Dawiḏ took them off. 
1Sam
17:40  And he took his staff in his hand,
and chose for himself five smooth stones from the wadi, and put them in a
shepherd’s bag, in a pouch which he had, and his sling was in his hand. And he
drew near to the Philistine. 
1Sam
17:41  And the Philistine came, and began
drawing near to Dawiḏ, and the man who bore the shield went before him. 
1Sam
17:42  And when the Philistine looked
about and saw Dawiḏ, he despised him, for he was a youth, and ruddy and
good-looking. 
1Sam
17:43  And the Philistine said to Dawiḏ,
“Am I a dog, that you come to me with sticks?” And the Philistine cursed Dawiḏ
by his mighty ones. 
1Sam
17:44  And the Philistine said to Dawiḏ,
“Come to me, and I give your flesh to the birds of the heavens and the beasts
of the field!”
1Sam
17:45  But Dawiḏ said to the
Philistine, “You come to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a javelin.
But I come to you in the Name of יהוה of hosts, the
Elohim of the armies of Yisra’ĕl, whom you have reproached. 
1Sam
17:46  “This day יהוה
shall deliver you into my hand, and I shall smite you and take your head from
you, and give the carcasses of the camp of the Philistines today to the birds
of the heavens and the wild beasts of the earth, so that all the earth know
that Elohim is for Yisra’ĕl, 
1Sam
17:47  and all this assembly know that יהוה
does not save with sword and spear, for the battle belongs to יהוה,
and He shall give you into our hands.” 
1Sam
17:48  And it came to be, when the
Philistine arose and came and drew near to meet Dawiḏ, that Dawiḏ
hurried and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine. 
1Sam
17:49  And Dawiḏ put his hand in
his bag and took out a stone, and slung it and smote the Philistine on his
forehead, so that the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell on his face to
the ground. 
1Sam
17:50  Thus Dawiḏ prevailed over
the Philistine with a sling and a stone, and smote the Philistine and killed
him, and there was no sword in the hand of Dawiḏ. 
1Sam
17:51  Then Dawiḏ ran and stood
over the Philistine, and took his sword and drew it out of its sheath and
killed him, and cut off his head with it. And when the Philistines saw that
their champion was dead, they fled. 
1Sam
17:52  And the men of Yisra’ĕl and
Yehuḏah arose and shouted, and pursued the Philistines as far as the
entrance of the valley and to the gates of Eqron. And the wounded of the
Philistines fell along the way to Sha‛arayim, even as far as Gath and
Eqron.
1Sam
17:53  Then the children of Yisra’ĕl
turned back from chasing the Philistines, and they plundered their camps. 
1Sam
17:54  And Dawiḏ took the head of
the Philistine and brought it to Yerushalayim, but he put his weapons in his
tent. 
1Sam
17:55  And when Sha’ul saw Dawiḏ
going out against the Philistine, he said to Aḇnĕr, the commander of
the army, “Aḇnĕr, whose son is this youth?” And Aḇnĕr
said, “As your being lives, O sovereign, I do not know.” 
1Sam
17:56  And the sovereign said, “Ask whose
son this young man is.” 
1Sam
17:57  And when Dawiḏ returned from
the slaughter of the Philistine, Aḇnĕr took him and brought him
before Sha’ul with the head of the Philistine in his hand. 
1Sam
17:58  And Sha’ul said to him, “Whose son
are you, young man?” And Dawiḏ said, “The son of your servant Yishai the
Bĕyth Leḥemite.” 
1Sam
18:1  And it came to be, when he had
ended speaking to Sha’ul, that the being of Yehonathan was knit to the being of
Dawiḏ, and Yehonathan loved him as his own being. 
1Sam
18:2  And Sha’ul took him that day, and
would not let him return to his father’s house any more. 
1Sam
18:3  And Yehonathan and Dawiḏ made
a covenant, because he loved him as his own being. 
1Sam
18:4  And Yehonathan took off the robe
that was on him and gave it to Dawiḏ, and his garments, even to his sword
and his bow and his girdle. 
1Sam
18:5  And Dawiḏ went out wherever
Sha’ul sent him. He acted wisely, and Sha’ul set him over the men of battle,
and it was right in the eyes of all the people and also in the eyes of Sha’ul’s
servants. 
1Sam
18:6  And it came to be, as they came in,
as Dawiḏ was returning from smiting the Philistine, that the women came
out from all the cities of Yisra’ĕl, singing and dancing, to meet Sha’ul
the sovereign with tambourines, with joy, and with musical instruments. 
1Sam
18:7  And the women sang as they danced,
and said, “Sha’ul smote his thousands, and Dawiḏ his ten thousands.” 
1Sam
18:8  And Sha’ul was very wroth, and this
matter was evil in his eyes, and he said, “To Dawiḏ they have given ten
thousands, and to me they have given thousands. So what more for him, except
the reign?” 
1Sam
18:9  And from that day on Sha’ul eyed
Dawiḏ. 
1Sam
18:10  And it came to be on the next day
that an evil spirit from Elohim came upon Sha’ul, and he prophesied inside the
house, while Dawiḏ was playing the
lyre with his hand, as usual. And the spear was in the hand of Sha’ul. 
1Sam
18:11  Then Sha’ul hurled the spear, for
he said, “Let me smite Dawiḏ, even to the wall.” But twice Dawiḏ
withdrew from his presence. 
1Sam
18:12  And Sha’ul was afraid of Dawiḏ,
because יהוה was with him, but from Sha’ul He had
turned away. 
1Sam
18:13  Sha’ul therefore removed him from
his presence, and made him his commander over a thousand. And he went out and
came in before the people. 
1Sam
18:14  And Dawiḏ was acting wisely
in all his ways, and יהוה was with him. 
1Sam
18:15  And Sha’ul saw that he was acting
very wisely, and was afraid of him. 
1Sam
18:16  But all Yisra’ĕl and Yehuḏah
loved Dawiḏ, as he went out and came in before them. 
1Sam
18:17  And Sha’ul said to Dawiḏ, “See
my older daughter Mĕraḇ! I give her to you as a wife. Only be brave
for me, and fight the battles of יהוה.” For Sha’ul
thought, “Let not my hand be against him, but let the hand of the Philistines
be against him.” 
1Sam
18:18  And Dawiḏ said to Sha’ul, “Who
am I, and what is my life or my father’s clan in Yisra’ĕl, that I should
be son-in-law to the sovereign?” 
1Sam
18:19  And it came to be at the time when
Mĕraḇ, Sha’ul’s daughter, should have been given to Dawiḏ,
that she was given to Aḏri’ĕl the Meḥolathite as a wife. 
1Sam
18:20  And Miḵal, Sha’ul’s
daughter, loved Dawiḏ. And they told Sha’ul, and the matter was right in
his eyes. 
1Sam
18:21  And Sha’ul said, “Let me give her
to him and let her be a snare to him, and the hand of the Philistines be
against him.” So Sha’ul said to Dawiḏ a second time, “Become my
son-in-law today.” 
1Sam
18:22  And Sha’ul commanded his servants,
“Speak to Dawiḏ gently, and say, ‘See, the sovereign has delighted in
you, and all his servants have loved you. And now, be the sovereign’s son-in-law!’
” 
1Sam
18:23  And the servants of Sha’ul spoke
those words in the hearing of Dawiḏ. And Dawiḏ said, “Does it seem
to you a small matter to be a sovereign’s son-in-law, seeing I am a poor man,
and lightly esteemed?” 
1Sam
18:24  And the servants of Sha’ul told
him, saying, “Dawiḏ has spoken according to these words.” 
1Sam
18:25  And Sha’ul said, “Say to Dawiḏ,
‘The sovereign has no delight in any payment for the bride but one hundred
foreskins of the Philistines, to take vengeance on the sovereign’s enemies.’ ”
But Sha’ul intended to have Dawiḏ fall by the hand of the Philistines. 
1Sam
18:26  And his servants declared these
words to Dawiḏ, and it pleased Dawiḏ well to become the sovereign’s
son-in-law. And the days had not expired, 
1Sam
18:27  and Dawiḏ arose and went, he
and his men, and smote two hundred men of the Philistines. And Dawiḏ
brought their foreskins, and they set them before the sovereign, to become the
sovereign’s son-in-law. And Sha’ul gave him Miḵal his daughter as a wife.

1Sam
18:28  And Sha’ul saw and knew that יהוה
was with Dawiḏ, and Miḵal daughter of Sha’ul did love him. 
1Sam
18:29  So then Sha’ul was still more
afraid of Dawiḏ. And Sha’ul came to be an enemy of Dawiḏ all the
days. 
1Sam
18:30  And the princes of the Philistines
went out to fight. And it came to be,
whenever they went out, that Dawiḏ acted more wisely than all the
servants of Sha’ul, so that his name came to be very precious. 
1Sam
19:1  And Sha’ul spoke to Yonathan his
son and to all his servants, to put Dawiḏ to death. But Yehonathan, Sha’ul’s
son, delighted much in Dawiḏ, 
1Sam
19:2  and Yehonathan declared to Dawiḏ,
saying, “My father Sha’ul seeks to put you to death. And now, please be on your
guard until morning, and dwell in secrecy, and hide. 
1Sam
19:3  “And I myself shall go out and
stand beside my father in the field where you are, and speak with my father
about you, and shall see, and shall let you know.” 
1Sam
19:4  And Yehonathan spoke well of Dawiḏ
to Sha’ul his father, and said to him, “Let not the sovereign sin against his
servant, against Dawiḏ, because he has not sinned against you, and
because his works have been very good toward you. 
1Sam
19:5  “For he took his life in his hands
and smote the Philistine, and יהוה wrought a great
deliverance for all Yisra’ĕl. You saw it and rejoiced. Why then do you sin
against innocent blood, to put Dawiḏ to death without cause?” 
1Sam
19:6  And Sha’ul listened to the voice of
Yehonathan, and Sha’ul swore, “As יהוה lives, he does
not die.” 
1Sam
19:7  Yehonathan then called Dawiḏ,
and Yehonathan told him all these words. So Yehonathan brought Dawiḏ to
Sha’ul, and he was in his presence as before. 
1Sam
19:8  And there was fighting again, and
Dawiḏ went out and fought with the Philistines, and smote them, a great
smiting, and they fled before him. 
1Sam
19:9  And an evil spirit from יהוה
came upon Sha’ul as he sat in his house with his spear in his hand. And Dawiḏ
was playing the lyre with his hand, 
1Sam
19:10  and Sha’ul sought to smite the
spear through Dawiḏ, and into the wall, but he slipped away from the
presence of Sha’ul, so he smote the spear into the wall. And Dawiḏ fled
and escaped that night. 
1Sam
19:11  And Sha’ul sent messengers to Dawiḏ’s
house to watch him and to put him to death in the morning. And Miḵal,
Dawiḏ’s wife, informed him, saying, “If you do not save your life
tonight, tomorrow you are put to death.”
1Sam
19:12  So Miḵal let Dawiḏ
down through a window, and he went and fled and escaped. 
1Sam
19:13  And Miḵal took the household
idol and laid it in the bed, and put a cover of goats’ hair for his head, and covered it with a garment. 
1Sam
19:14  And when Sha’ul sent messengers to
take Dawiḏ, she said, “He is sick.” 
1Sam
19:15  And Sha’ul sent the messengers
back to see Dawiḏ, saying, “Bring him up to me in the bed to put him to
death.” 
1Sam
19:16  And the messengers came in and saw
the household idol in the bed, with a cover of goats’ hair for his head. 
1Sam
19:17  Sha’ul then said to Miḵal, “Why
have you deceived me like this, and sent my enemy away, so that he escaped?”
And Miḵal answered Sha’ul, “He said to me, ‘Let me go, why should I put
you to death?’ ” 
1Sam
19:18  Now Dawiḏ fled and escaped,
and went to Shemu’ĕl at Ramah, and told him all that Sha’ul had done to
him. And he and Shemu’ĕl went and dwelt in Nawith. 
1Sam
19:19  And it was reported to Sha’ul,
saying, “See, Dawiḏ is in Nawith in Ramah!” 
1Sam
19:20  And Sha’ul sent messengers to take
Dawiḏ. And they saw the assembly of the prophets prophesying, and Shemu’ĕl
standing as leader over them, and the Spirit of Elohim came upon the messengers
of Sha’ul, and they also prophesied. 
1Sam
19:21  And when Sha’ul was told, he sent
other messengers, and they prophesied likewise. So Sha’ul sent messengers
again, the third time, and they prophesied also. 
1Sam
19:22  Then he himself went to Ramah, and
came to the great well that is at Seḵu. And he asked, and said, “Where
are Shemu’ĕl and Dawiḏ?” And one said, “There in Nawith in Ramah.” 
1Sam
19:23  So he went there to Nawith in
Ramah. And the Spirit of Elohim was upon him too, and he went on and prophesied
until he came to Nawith in Ramah. 
1Sam
19:24  And he also stripped off his
garments and prophesied before Shemu’ĕl, and lay down naked all that day
and all that night. Therefore they say, “Is Sha’ul also among the prophets?” 
1Sam
20:1  And Dawiḏ fled from Nawith in
Ramah, and went and said to Yehonathan, “What have I done? What is my
crookedness, and what is my sin before your father, that he seeks my life?” 
1Sam
20:2  And Yehonathan said to him, “Far be
it! You are not going to die! See, my father does no big matter nor small
matter without disclosing it to me. And why should my father hide this matter
from me? It is not so!” 
1Sam
20:3  But Dawiḏ swore again, and
said, “Your father knows well that I have found favour in your eyes, and he
says, ‘Do not let Yehonathan know this, lest he be grieved.’ But truly, as יהוה
lives and as your being lives, there is but a step between me and death.” 
1Sam
20:4  And Yehonathan said to Dawiḏ,
“Whatever your desire is, I do it for you.” 
1Sam
20:5  And Dawiḏ said to Yehonathan,
“See, tomorrow is the New Moon, and I ought to sit with the sovereign to eat.
But let me go, and I shall hide in the field until the third day at evening. 
1Sam
20:6  “If your father misses me at all,
then you shall say, ‘Dawiḏ earnestly asked my permission to run over to Bĕyth
Leḥem, his city, for a yearly slaughtering is made there for all the
clan.’ 
1Sam
20:7  “If he says thus, ‘It is well,’
your servant is safe. But if he is very displeased, then know that he has
resolved to do evil. 
1Sam
20:8  “And you shall show kindness to
your servant, for you have brought your servant into a covenant of יהוה
with you. And if there is crookedness in me, put me to death yourself, for why
should you bring me to your father?” 
1Sam
20:9  And Yehonathan said, “Far be it
from you! For if I knew with certainty that my father has resolved that evil is
to come upon you, then would I not make it known to you?” 
1Sam
20:10  And Dawiḏ said to Yehonathan,
“Who would make it known to me, or what if your father answers you sharply?” 
1Sam
20:11  And Yehonathan said to Dawiḏ,
“Come, and let us go out into the field.” And they both went out into the
field.
1Sam
20:12  And Yehonathan said to Dawiḏ,
“ יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl be witness! When I search out my father sometime tomorrow, or the
third day, and see if there is good toward Dawiḏ, and I do not send to
you or disclose it to you,
1Sam
20:13  so let יהוה
do so and much more to Yehonathan. And if it pleases my father to do you evil,
then I shall disclose it to you and send you away, and you shall go in peace.
And יהוה be with you as He has been with my father. 
1Sam
20:14  “But show me the kindness of יהוה,
not only while I still live, so that I do not die, 
1Sam
20:15  and do not cut off your kindness
from my house forever, no, not when יהוה has cut off
every one of the enemies of Dawiḏ from the face of the earth.” 
1Sam
20:16  And Yehonathan made a covenant
with the house of Dawiḏ, saying,
“ יהוה shall require it at the hand of the enemies of
Dawiḏ.” 
1Sam
20:17  And Yehonathan again made Dawiḏ
swear, because he loved him, for he loved him as he loved his own being. 
1Sam
20:18  So Yehonathan said to him, “Tomorrow
is the New Moon, and you shall be missed, because your seat shall be empty. 
1Sam
20:19  “And on the third day, go down
quickly and you shall come to the place where you hid on the day of the deed,
and shall remain by the stone Ĕtsel. 
1Sam
20:20  “And let me shoot three arrows to
the side of it as though shooting at a target, 
1Sam
20:21  and see, I shall send the youth,
saying, ‘Go, find the arrows.’ If I expressly say to the youth, ‘Look, the
arrows are on this side of you, get them and come,’ then, as יהוה
lives, there is safety for you and no concern. 
1Sam
20:22  “But if I say thus to the youth, ‘Look,
the arrows are beyond you,’ go your way, for יהוה has
sent you away. 
1Sam
20:23  “And as for the word which you and
I have spoken of, see, יהוה is between you and me
forever.” 
1Sam
20:24  And Dawiḏ hid in the field.
And when the New Moon came, the sovereign sat down by the food to eat. 
1Sam
20:25  And the sovereign sat on his seat,
as at other times, on a seat by the wall, with Yehonathan standing, and Aḇnĕr
sitting by Sha’ul’s side, but the place of Dawiḏ was empty. 
1Sam
20:26  But Sha’ul spoke not a word that day, for he thought, “It is
an accident; he is not clean, for he has not been cleansed.” 
1Sam
20:27  And it came to be the next day,
the second day of the month, that Dawiḏ’s place was empty. And Sha’ul
said to Yehonathan his son, “Why has the son of Yishai not come to eat, either
yesterday or today?” 
1Sam
20:28  And Yehonathan answered Sha’ul, “Dawiḏ
earnestly asked my permission to go to Bĕyth Leḥem. 
1Sam
20:29  “And he said, ‘Please let me go,
for our clan has a slaughtering in the city, and my brother has commanded me to
be there. And now, if I have found favour in your eyes, please let me get away
and see my brothers.’ That is why he has not come to the sovereign’s table.” 
1Sam
20:30  Then the displeasure of Sha’ul
burned against Yehonathan, and he said to him, “You son of a perverse,
rebellious woman! Do I not know that you have chosen the son of Yishai to your
own shame and to the shame of your mother’s nakedness? 
1Sam
20:31  “For as long as the son of Yishai
lives on the earth, you shall not be established, you and your reign. And now,
send and bring him to me, for he is a son of death.” 
1Sam
20:32  And Yehonathan answered Sha’ul his
father, and said to him, “Why should he be put to death? What has he done?”
1Sam
20:33  At that, Sha’ul hurled a spear at
him to smite him. Then Yehonathan knew that his father had resolved to put Dawiḏ
to death. 
1Sam
20:34  And Yehonathan rose up from the
table in the heat of displeasure, and ate no food the second day of the month,
for he was grieved for Dawiḏ, because his father put him to shame. 
1Sam
20:35  And it came to be, in the morning,
that Yehonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with Dawiḏ,
and a small youth was with him. 
1Sam
20:36  And he said to the youth, “Now
run, find the arrows which I shoot.” As the youth ran, he shot an arrow beyond
him. 
1Sam
20:37  And when the youth came to the
place where the arrow was which Yehonathan had shot, Yehonathan called out
after the youth and said, “Is not the arrow beyond you?” 
1Sam
20:38  And Yehonathan shouted after the
youth, “Make haste, hurry, do not stand still!” And Yehonathan’s youth picked
up the arrows and came to his master. 
1Sam
20:39  But the youth knew not a speck.
Only Yehonathan and Dawiḏ knew of the matter. 
1Sam
20:40  Then Yehonathan gave his weapons
to the youth and said to him, “Go, take them to the city.” 
1Sam
20:41  And as soon as the youth had gone,
Dawiḏ rose up from the south side, and fell on his face to the ground,
and bowed down three times. And they kissed one another. And they wept
together, but Dawiḏ more so. 
1Sam
20:42  And Yehonathan said to Dawiḏ,
“Go in peace, since we have both sworn in the Name of יהוה,
saying, ‘ יהוה is between you and me, and between your
seed and my seed, forever.’ ” Then he arose and left, and Yehonathan went into
the city. 
1Sam
21:1  And Dawiḏ came to Noḇ,
to Aḥimeleḵ the priest. And Aḥimeleḵ trembled when he
met Dawiḏ, and asked him, “Why are you alone, and no one is with you?” 
1Sam
21:2  And Dawiḏ said to
Aḥimeleḵ the priest, “The sovereign has commanded me a word, and
said to me, ‘Let no one know whatever of the word about which I send you, and
which I have commanded you.’ And I have directed my young men to such and such
a place. 
1Sam
21:3  “And now, what do you have on hand?
Give five loaves into my hand, or whatever is found.” 
1Sam
21:4  And the priest answered Dawiḏ
and said, “There is no ordinary bread on hand, but there is set-apart bread –
provided the young men have kept themselves from women.” 
1Sam
21:5  And Dawiḏ answered the
priest, and said to him, “Truly, women have been kept from us about three days
since I came out. And the vessels of the young men are set-apart, and it is an
ordinary mission, and also, it was set-apart in the vessel today.” 
1Sam
21:6  Then the priest gave him set-apart bread, for there was no bread there
except the showbread which had been taken from before יהוה,
in order to put hot bread in on the day it is taken away. 
1Sam
21:7  Now one of the servants of Sha’ul
was there that day, detained before יהוה. And his name
was Do’ĕḡ, an Eḏomite, the chief of the herdsmen who belonged
to Sha’ul. 
1Sam
21:8  And Dawiḏ said to
Aḥimeleḵ, “Is there not here on hand a spear or a sword? For I have
brought neither my sword nor my weapons with me, because the matter of the
sovereign was urgent.” 
1Sam
21:9  And the priest said, “The sword of
Golyath the Philistine, whom you smote in the Valley of Ĕlah. See, it is
wrapped in a garment behind the shoulder garment. If you would take it, take
it. For there is none other except this one here.” And Dawiḏ said, “There
is none like it, give it to me.” 
1Sam
21:10  And Dawiḏ rose and fled that
day from before Sha’ul, and went to Aḵish the sovereign of Gath. 
1Sam
21:11  But the servants of Aḵish
said to him, “Is this not Dawiḏ the sovereign of the land? Did they not
sing of him to each other in dances, saying, ‘Sha’ul smote his thousands, and
Dawiḏ his ten thousands’?” 
1Sam
21:12  And Dawiḏ took these words
to heart, and was very much afraid of Aḵish the sovereign of Gath, 
1Sam
21:13  and changed his behaviour before
them, and feigned madness in their hands, and scratched on the doors of the
gate, and let his saliva run down on his beard. 
1Sam
21:14  Then Aḵish said to his
servants, “Look, you see the man is acting like a madman. Why do you bring him
to me? 
1Sam
21:15  “Am I short of madmen, that you
have brought this one to act as a madman near me? Should this one come into my
house?” 
1Sam
22:1  And Dawiḏ went from there and
escaped to the cave of Aḏullam. And his brothers and all his father’s
house heard it, and went down to him there. 
1Sam
22:2  And everyone who was in distress,
everyone who was in debt, and everyone bitter in being gathered to him. So he
became head over them, and there were about four hundred men with him. 
1Sam
22:3  And Dawiḏ went from there to
Mitspeh of Mo’aḇ and said to the sovereign of Mo’aḇ, “Please let my
father and mother come here with you, till I know what Elohim does for me.” 
1Sam
22:4  And he left them with the sovereign
of Mo’aḇ, and they dwelt with him all the time that Dawiḏ was in
the stronghold. 
1Sam
22:5  And the prophet Gaḏ said to
Dawiḏ, “Do not remain in the stronghold. Leave, and go to the land of
Yehuḏah.” So Dawiḏ left and went into the Ḥereth woods. 
1Sam
22:6  And Sha’ul heard that Dawiḏ
and the men who were with him had been discovered, while Sha’ul was in Giḇ‛ah,
sitting under a tamarisk tree in Ramah, with his spear in his hand, and all his
servants standing about him. 
1Sam
22:7  And Sha’ul said to his servants who
were standing around him, “Hear now, you Binyamites! Does the son of Yishai
give every one of you fields and vineyards, and make you all commanders of
thousands and commanders of hundreds? 
1Sam
22:8  “For all of you have conspired
against me, and there is no one who reveals to me that my son has made a
covenant with the son of Yishai. And there is not one of you who is grieved for
me or reveals to me that my son has stirred up my servant against me, to lie in
wait, as it is this day.” 
1Sam
22:9  And Do’ĕḡ the Eḏomite,
who was set over the servants of Sha’ul, answered and said, “I saw the son of
Yishai going to Noḇ, to Aḥimeleḵ son of Aḥituḇ. 
1Sam
22:10  “And he inquired of יהוה
for him, gave him food, and gave him the sword of Golyath the Philistine.” 
1Sam
22:11  And the sovereign sent someone to
call Aḥimeleḵ the priest, son of Aḥituḇ, and all his
father’s house, the priests who were in Noḇ. And they all came to the
sovereign, 
1Sam
22:12  and Sha’ul said, “Hear now, son of
Aḥituḇ!” And he answered, “Here I am, my master.” 
1Sam
22:13  And Sha’ul said to him, “Why have
you conspired against me, you and the son of Yishai, by giving him bread and a
sword, and have inquired of Elohim for him, to rise against me, to lie in wait,
as it is this day?” 
1Sam
22:14  And Aḥimeleḵ answered
the sovereign and said, “And who among all your servants is so trustworthy as
Dawiḏ, who is the sovereign’s son-in-law, and has turned aside to your
counsel, and is esteemed in your house? 
1Sam
22:15  “Have I today begun to inquire of
Elohim for him? Far be it from me! Let not the sovereign lay a case against his
servant, or against any in the house of my father. For your servant knew not of
all this, little or much.” 
1Sam
22:16  And the sovereign said, “You shall
certainly die, Aḥimeleḵ, you and all your father’s house!” 
1Sam
22:17  The sovereign then said to the
guards who stood about him, “Turn and put the priests of יהוה
to death, because their hand also is with Dawiḏ, and because they knew
when he fled and did not reveal it to me.” But the servants of the sovereign
would not lift their hands to come against the priests of יהוה.

1Sam
22:18  And the sovereign said to Do’ĕḡ,
“You turn and come against the priests!” So Do’ĕḡ the Eḏomite
turned and came against the priests, and put to death on that day eighty-five
men who wore a linen shoulder garment. 
1Sam
22:19  And he smote Noḇ, the city of
the priests, with the edge of the sword, from men even to women, from children
even to nursing infants, and oxen and donkeys and sheep, with the edge of the
sword.
1Sam
22:20  And one of the sons of
Aḥimeleḵ son of Aḥituḇ, named Eḇyathar, escaped
and fled after Dawiḏ. 
1Sam
22:21  And Eḇyathar reported to
Dawiḏ that Sha’ul had slain the priests of יהוה. 
1Sam
22:22  And Dawiḏ said to Eḇyathar,
“I knew that day, when Do’ĕḡ the Eḏomite was there, that he
would certainly inform Sha’ul. I am accountable for all the lives of your
father’s house. 
1Sam
22:23  “Remain with me, do not fear. For
he who seeks my life seeks your life, but with me you are safe.” 
1Sam
23:1  And they informed Dawiḏ,
saying, “See, the Philistines are fighting against Qe‛ilah, and they are
plundering the threshing-floors.” 
1Sam
23:2  So Dawiḏ inquired of יהוה,
saying, “Shall I go and smite these Philistines?” And יהוה
said to Dawiḏ, “Go and smite the Philistines, and save Qe‛ilah.” 
1Sam
23:3  And Dawiḏ’s men said to him, “See,
we here in Yehuḏah are afraid. How much more, then, if we go to Qe‛ilah
against the armies of the Philistines?” 
1Sam
23:4  And Dawiḏ inquired of יהוה
once again. And יהוה answered him and said, “Arise, go
down to Qe‛ilah, for I am giving the Philistines into your hand.” 
1Sam
23:5  So Dawiḏ and his men went to
Qe‛ilah and fought with the Philistines, and he led away their livestock
and smote them, a great smiting. Thus Dawiḏ saved the inhabitants of Qe‛ilah.
1Sam
23:6  And it came to be, when Eḇyathar
son of Aḥimeleḵ fled to Dawiḏ at Qe‛ilah, that he went
down with a shoulder garment in his hand. 
1Sam
23:7  And Sha’ul was informed that Dawiḏ
had gone to Qe‛ilah. Then Sha’ul said, “Elohim has estranged him into my
hand, for he has shut himself in by entering a town that has gates and bars.” 
1Sam
23:8  And Sha’ul summoned all the people
to battle, to go down to Qe‛ilah to besiege Dawiḏ and his men. 
1Sam
23:9  And Dawiḏ knew that Sha’ul
was plotting evil against him, and said to Eḇyathar the priest, “Bring
the shoulder garment here.” 
1Sam
23:10  And Dawiḏ said, “O יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, Your servant has heard for certain that Sha’ul seeks
to come to Qe‛ilah to destroy the city for my sake. 
1Sam
23:11  “Are the landowners of Qe‛ilah
going to surrender me into his hand? Is Sha’ul coming down, as Your servant has
heard? O יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, I pray, let Your
servant know.” And יהוה said, “He is coming down.” 
1Sam
23:12  And Dawiḏ said, “Are the
landowners of Qe‛ilah going to surrender me and my men into the hand of
Sha’ul?” And יהוה said, “They are going to surrender
you.” 
1Sam
23:13  Then Dawiḏ and his men,
about six hundred, arose and left Qe‛ilah and went wherever they could
go. And Sha’ul was informed that Dawiḏ had escaped from Qe‛ilah,
and he ceased to go out. 
1Sam
23:14  And Dawiḏ remained in the
wilderness, in strongholds, and remained in the hill country in the Wilderness
of Ziph. And Sha’ul sought him every day, but Elohim did not give him into his
hand. 
1Sam
23:15  And Dawiḏ saw that Sha’ul
had come out to seek his life while Dawiḏ was in the Wilderness of Ziph
at Ḥoresh. 
1Sam
23:16  And Yehonathan, Sha’ul’s son,
arose and went to Dawiḏ at Ḥoresh and strengthened his hand in
Elohim, 
1Sam
23:17  and said to him, “Do not fear, for
the hand of Sha’ul my father is not going to find you, and you are to reign
over Yisra’ĕl, and I am to be next to you. Even my father Sha’ul knows
that.”
1Sam
23:18  And they made a covenant before יהוה.
And Dawiḏ remained at Ḥoresh while Yehonathan went to his own
house. 
1Sam
23:19  And the Ziphites came up to Sha’ul
at Giḇ‛ah, saying, “Is Dawiḏ not hiding with us in
strongholds Ḥoresh, in the hill of Ḥaḵilah, which is on the
south of the wasteland? 
1Sam
23:20  “And now, O sovereign, by all the
desire of your being, come down, come down, and our part is to surrender him
into the sovereign’s hand.” 
1Sam
23:21  And Sha’ul said, “Blessed are you
of יהוה, for you have sympathy with me. 
1Sam
23:22  “Please go, prepare yet further
and find out and see the place where his hide-out is, who has seen him there.
For I am told that he is very cunning. 
1Sam
23:23  “So look, and learn all about the
hiding places where he hides. And you shall come back to me with certainty,
then I shall go with you. And it shall be, if he is in the land, that I shall
search for him throughout all the clans of Yehuḏah.” 
1Sam
23:24  And they rose up and went to Ziph
before Sha’ul, while Dawiḏ and his men were in the Wilderness of Ma‛on,
in the desert plain on the south of the wasteland. 
1Sam
23:25  And Sha’ul and his men went to
seek him, and they informed Dawiḏ, so he went down to the rock, and
remained in the Wilderness of Ma‛on. And when Sha’ul heard this, he
pursued Dawiḏ in the Wilderness of Ma‛on. 
1Sam
23:26  And Sha’ul went on one side of the
mountain, and Dawiḏ and his men on the other side of the mountain. And
Dawiḏ was hurrying to get away from Sha’ul, for Sha’ul and his men were
surrounding Dawiḏ and his men to take them. 
1Sam
23:27  Then a messenger came to Sha’ul,
saying, “Hurry and come, for the Philistines have invaded the land!” 
1Sam
23:28  So Sha’ul turned back from
pursuing Dawiḏ, and went against the Philistines. Therefore they called
that place Sela Hammaḥleqoth. 
1Sam
23:29  And Dawiḏ went up from there
and remained in strongholds at Ĕn Geḏi. 
1Sam
24:1  And it came to be, when Sha’ul had
returned from pursuing the Philistines, that it was reported to him, saying, “See,
Dawiḏ is in the Wilderness of Ĕn Geḏi.” 
1Sam
24:2  So Sha’ul took three thousand
chosen men from all Yisra’ĕl, and went to seek Dawiḏ and his men on
the Rocks of the Wild Goats. 
1Sam
24:3  And he came to the sheepfolds, on
the way, and there was a cave. And Sha’ul went in to relieve himself. Now Dawiḏ
and his men were sitting in the sides of the cave. 
1Sam
24:4  And the men of Dawiḏ said to
him, “See, the day of which יהוה said to you, ‘See, I
am giving your enemy into your hand, and you shall do to him as it seems good
to you!’ ” And Dawiḏ arose and gently cut off a corner of Sha’ul’s robe. 
1Sam
24:5  And it came to be afterward that
the heart of Dawiḏ smote him because he had cut the robe of Sha’ul. 
1Sam
24:6  So he said to his men, “Far be it
from me, by יהוה, that I should do this matter to my
master, anointed of יהוה, to stretch out my hand
against him, for he is the anointed of יהוה.” 
1Sam
24:7  And Dawiḏ dispersed his
servants with words, and did not allow them to rise against Sha’ul. And Sha’ul
rose up from the cave and went on his way. 
1Sam
24:8  And afterward Dawiḏ arose and
went out of the cave, and called out to Sha’ul, saying, “My master the
sovereign!” And when Sha’ul looked behind him, Dawiḏ bowed with his face
to the earth, and did obeisance. 
1Sam
24:9  And Dawiḏ said to Sha’ul, “Why
do you listen to the words of men who say, ‘See, Dawiḏ seeks to do you
evil’? 
1Sam
24:10  “See, this day your eyes have seen
that יהוה gave you today into my hand in the cave, and one said to slay you. But my eye
pardoned you, and I said, ‘I do not stretch out my hand against my master, for
he is the anointed of יהוה.’ 
1Sam
24:11  “And my father, see! Yea, see the
corner of your robe in my hand! For in that I cut off the corner of your robe,
and did not slay you, know and see that there is neither evil nor rebellion in
my hand, and I have not sinned against you, while you are hunting my life to
take it. 
1Sam
24:12  “Let יהוה
judge between you and me, and let יהוה revenge me on
you, but my hand is not against you. 
1Sam
24:13  “As the proverb of the ancients
says, ‘Wrong comes from the wrongdoer.’ But my hand is not against you. 
1Sam
24:14  “After whom has the sovereign of
Yisra’ĕl come out? Whom do you pursue? A dead dog? A flea? 
1Sam
24:15  “And יהוה
shall be judge, and rightly rule between you and me, and see and plead my case,
and rightly rule me out of your hand.” 
1Sam
24:16  And it came to be, when Dawiḏ
had ended speaking these words to Sha’ul, that Sha’ul said, “Is this your
voice, my son Dawiḏ?” So Sha’ul lifted up his voice and wept. 
1Sam
24:17  And he said to Dawiḏ, “You
are more righteous than I, for you have rewarded me with good, whereas I have
rewarded you with evil. 
1Sam
24:18  “And you have shown today how you
have done good to me, for when יהוה surrendered me into
your hand you did not slay me. 
1Sam
24:19  “For if a man finds his enemy, shall
he let him get away safely? And let יהוה reward you
with good for what you have done to me today. 
1Sam
24:20  “And now look, I know that you
shall certainly reign, and that the reign of Yisra’ĕl shall be established
in your hand. 
1Sam
24:21  “And now, swear to me by יהוה
that you do not cut off my seed after me, nor destroy my name from my father’s
house.” 
1Sam
24:22  And Dawiḏ swore to Sha’ul.
Then Sha’ul went home, and Dawiḏ and his men went up to the stronghold. 
1Sam
25:1  And Shemu’ĕl died, and all
Yisra’ĕl gathered and mourned for him, and buried him at his home in
Ramah. And Dawiḏ arose and went down into the Wilderness of Paran. 
1Sam
25:2  Now there was a man in Ma‛on
and his work was in Karmel, and the man was very great. And he had three
thousand sheep and a thousand goats. And he came to be shearing his sheep in
Karmel. 
1Sam
25:3  And the name of the man was Naḇal,
and the name of his wife Aḇiḡayil. And she was a woman of good
understanding and good-looking. But the man was hard and evil in his doings.
And he was of Kalĕḇ. 
1Sam
25:4  And Dawiḏ heard in the
wilderness that Naḇal was shearing his sheep. 
1Sam
25:5  And Dawiḏ sent ten young men,
and Dawiḏ said to the young men, “Go up to Karmel, and you shall come to
Naḇal, and greet him in my name,
1Sam
25:6  and say this, ‘Long life and peace
to you! And peace to your house, and peace to all that you have! 
1Sam
25:7  ‘And now, I have heard that you
have shearers. Now your shepherds have been with us. We did not put them to
shame, and not a speck of theirs was missing all the days they were in Karmel. 
1Sam
25:8  ‘Ask your young men, and let them
inform you. So let my young men find
favour in your eyes, for we come on a good day. Please give whatever comes to
your hand to your servants and to your son Dawiḏ.’ ”
1Sam
25:9  And the young men of Dawiḏ
came and spoke to Naḇal according to all these words in the name of Dawiḏ,
and waited. 
1Sam
25:10  But Naḇal answered the
servants of Dawiḏ and said, “Who is Dawiḏ, and who is the son of
Yishai? The servants who are running away from their masters, have become many
nowadays. 
1Sam
25:11  “And shall I take my bread and my
water and my meat that I have slaughtered for my shearers, and give it to men
coming from who knows where?” 
1Sam
25:12  And the young men of Dawiḏ
turned around on their way and went back, and came and reported to him all
these words. 
1Sam
25:13  And Dawiḏ said to his men, “Each
one gird on his sword.” So they each girded on his sword, and Dawiḏ also
girded on his sword. And about four hundred men went with Dawiḏ, and two
hundred remained with the baggage. 
1Sam
25:14  And one of the young men informed
Aḇiḡayil, the wife of Naḇal, saying, “See, Dawiḏ have
sent messengers from the wilderness to greet our master, but he scoffed at
them. 
1Sam
25:15  “But the men were very good to us,
and did not put us to shame, nor did we miss any item all the days we accompanied them, when we were in the fields. 
1Sam
25:16  “They were a wall to us both by
night and day, all the days we were with them tending the sheep. 
1Sam
25:17  “And now, know and see what you
should do, for evil has been resolved against our master, and against all his
household, and he is too much of a son of Beliya‛al to speak to.” 
1Sam
25:18  Then Aḇiḡayil made
haste and took two hundred loaves, and two skins of wine, and five sheep made
ready, five measures of roasted grain, and one hundred clusters of raisins, and
two hundred cakes of figs, and loaded them on donkeys. 
1Sam
25:19  And she said to her servants, “Pass
over before me. See, I am coming after you.” But she did not inform her husband
Naḇal. 
1Sam
25:20  And it came to be, as she rode on
the donkey, that she went down under cover of the hill, and there were Dawiḏ
and his men, coming down toward her, and she met them. 
1Sam
25:21  And Dawiḏ had said, “Only in
vain have I protected all that this one has in the wilderness, so that not a
speck was missing of all that belongs to him. And he has repaid me evil for
good. 
1Sam
25:22  “Let Elohim do so, and more also,
to the enemies of Dawiḏ, if I leave one male of all who belong to him by
morning light.” 
1Sam
25:23  And Aḇiḡayil saw Dawiḏ,
and she hastened to come down from the donkey, and fell on her face before Dawiḏ,
and bowed down to the ground, 
1Sam
25:24  and fell at his feet and said, “On
me, my master, let this crookedness be on me! And please let your female
servant speak in your ears, and hear the words of your female servant. 
1Sam
25:25  “Please, let not my master regard
this man of Beliya‛al, Naḇal. For as his name is, so is he: Naḇal
is his name, and folly is with him. But I, your female servant, did not see the
young men of my master whom you sent. 
1Sam
25:26  “And now my master, as יהוה
lives and as your being lives, since יהוה has withheld
you from coming to bloodshed and from avenging yourself with your own hand, now
then, let your enemies be as Naḇal, even those seeking evil against my
master. 
1Sam
25:27  “And now this present which your
female servant has brought to my master, let it be given to the young men who
follow my master. 
1Sam
25:28  “Please forgive the transgression
of your female servant. For יהוה is certainly making a
steadfast house for my master, because my master fights the battles of יהוה,
and evil is not found in you in all your
days. 
1Sam
25:29  “And if a man rises to pursue you
and seek your life, and the life of my master has been bound in the bundle of
the living with יהוה your Elohim, then the lives of
your enemies He shall sling out, as from the pocket of a sling. 
1Sam
25:30  “And it shall be, when יהוה
has done for my master according to all the good that He has spoken concerning
you, and has appointed you ruler over Yisra’ĕl, 
1Sam
25:31  do not let this be a staggering
and stumbling of heart to my master, that you have shed blood without cause, or
that my master has saved himself. And when יהוה has
done good to my master, then remember your female servant.” 
1Sam
25:32  And Dawiḏ said to Aḇiḡayil,
“Blessed be יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, who sent you
to meet me today! 
1Sam
25:33  “And blessed is your good taste,
and blessed are you, because you have kept me this day from coming to bloodshed
and from avenging myself with my own hand. 
1Sam
25:34  “Nevertheless, as יהוה
Elohim of Yisra’ĕl lives, who has kept me back from doing evil to you, if
you had not hurried and come to meet me, not a male would have been left to Naḇal
by break of day, for certain.” 
1Sam
25:35  And Dawiḏ received from her
hand what she had brought him, and said to her, “Go up in peace to your house.
See, I have listened to your voice and have accepted your face.” 
1Sam
25:36  And Aḇiḡayil went to
Naḇal, and see, he was at a feast in his house, like the feast of a
sovereign. And Naḇal’s heart was glad within him, and he was exceedingly
drunk. So she told him not a word, little or much, until morning light. 
1Sam
25:37  And it came to be, in the morning,
when the wine had gone from Naḇal, and his wife had told him these
matters, that his heart died within him, and he became like a stone. 
1Sam
25:38  And it came to be in about ten
days, that יהוה smote Naḇal, and he died. 
1Sam
25:39  And Dawiḏ heard that Naḇal
was dead, and he said, “Blessed be יהוה, who has
pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Naḇal, and has kept His
servant from evil! For יהוה has returned the evil of Naḇal
on his own head.” And Dawiḏ sent and spoke to Aḇiḡayil, to
take her as his wife. 
1Sam
25:40  And when the servants of Dawiḏ
had come to Aḇiḡayil at Karmel, they spoke to her saying, “Dawiḏ
sent us to you, to ask you to become his wife.” 
1Sam
25:41  And she arose, bowed her face to
the earth, and said, “Here is your female servant, a servant to wash the feet
of the servants of my master.” 
1Sam
25:42  And Aḇiḡayil hurried
and rose, and rode on a donkey, with five of her female attendants. And she
followed the messengers of Dawiḏ, and became his wife. 
1Sam
25:43  Dawiḏ had also taken
Aḥino‛am of Yizre‛ĕl, and so both of them were his
wives. 
1Sam
25:44  But Sha’ul had given Miḵal
his daughter, Dawiḏ’s wife, to Palti son of Layish, who was from Galliym.

1Sam
26:1  And the Ziphites came to Sha’ul at
Giḇ‛ah, saying, “Is not Dawiḏ hiding himself in the hill of Ḥaḵilah,
overlooking the wasteland?” 
1Sam
26:2  And Sha’ul rose up and went down to
the Wilderness of Ziph, and with him three thousand chosen men of Yisra’ĕl,
to seek Dawiḏ in the Wilderness of Ziph. 
1Sam
26:3  And Sha’ul encamped in the hill of Ḥaḵilah,
overlooking the wasteland, by the way, while Dawiḏ was dwelling in the
wilderness, and he saw that Sha’ul came after him into the wilderness. 
1Sam
26:4  And Dawiḏ sent out spies, and
learned that Sha’ul had indeed come. 
1Sam
26:5  And Dawiḏ rose up and came to
the place where Sha’ul had encamped. And Dawiḏ saw the place where Sha’ul
lay, and Aḇnĕr son of Nĕr, the commander of his army. And Sha’ul
was lying within the enclosure, with the people encamped all around him. 
1Sam
26:6  And Dawiḏ spoke up and said
to Aḥimeleḵ the Ḥittite and to Aḇishai son of Tseruyah,
brother of Yo’aḇ, saying, “Who does go down with me to Sha’ul in the
camp?” And Aḇishai said, “I, I go down with you.” 
1Sam
26:7  And Dawiḏ and Aḇishai
came to the people by night and saw Sha’ul lying asleep within the camp, with
his spear stuck in the ground by his head, and Aḇnĕr and the people
lay all around him. 
1Sam
26:8  And Aḇishai said to Dawiḏ,
“Elohim has surrendered your enemy into your hand this day. And now, please,
let me smite him at once with the spear, right into the earth, and not a second
time!” 
1Sam
26:9  But Dawiḏ said to Aḇishai,
“Do not destroy him, for who shall stretch out his hand against the anointed of
יהוה, and be guiltless?” 
1Sam
26:10  Dawiḏ also said, “As יהוה
lives, except יהוה does smite him, or his day come that
he shall die, or he shall go out to battle and perish,
1Sam
26:11  far be it from me, by יהוה,
that I stretch out my hand against the anointed of יהוה.
And now, please take the spear and the jug of water that are by his head, and
let us go.” 
1Sam
26:12  So Dawiḏ took the spear and
the jug of water by Sha’ul’s head, and they went away. And no man saw it or
knew it or awoke, for they were all asleep, because a deep sleep from יהוה
had fallen on them. 
1Sam
26:13  And Dawiḏ passed over to the
other side, and stood on the top of a hill far away, a great distance being
between them. 
1Sam
26:14  And Dawiḏ called out to the
people and to Aḇnĕr son of Nĕr, saying, “Do you not answer, Aḇnĕr?”
And Aḇnĕr answered and said, “Who are you, calling out to the
sovereign?” 
1Sam
26:15  And Dawiḏ said to Aḇnĕr,
“Are you not a man? And who is like you in Yisra’ĕl? Why then have you not
guarded your master the sovereign? For one of the people came in to destroy
your master the sovereign.
1Sam
26:16  “What you have done is not good.
As יהוה lives, you are worthy to die, because you have
not guarded your master, the anointed of יהוה. And now
see where the sovereign’s spear is, and the jug of water that was by his head.”

1Sam
26:17  And Sha’ul recognised Dawiḏ’s
voice, and said, “Is that your voice, my son Dawiḏ?” And Dawiḏ
said, “It is my voice, my master, O sovereign.” 
1Sam
26:18  And he said, “Why is this that my
master is pursuing his servant? For what have I done, or what evil is in my
hand? 
1Sam
26:19  “And now, please, let my master
the sovereign hear the words of his servant: If יהוה
has moved you against me, let Him accept an offering. But if it is the children
of men, then they are cursed before יהוה, for they have
driven me out today that I should not join myself to the inheritance of יהוה,
saying, ‘Go, serve other mighty ones.’ 
1Sam
26:20  “And now, do not let my blood fall
to the earth before the face of יהוה. For the sovereign
of Yisra’ĕl has come out to seek a flea, as when one hunts a partridge in
the mountains.” 
1Sam
26:21  And Sha’ul said, “I have sinned.
Come back, my son Dawiḏ. For no more am I going to do evil to you,
because my life was precious in your eyes today. See, I have acted foolishly,
and have greatly strayed.” 
1Sam
26:22  And Dawiḏ answered and said,
“See, the sovereign’s spear! And let one of the young men come over and get it.

1Sam
26:23  “And let יהוה
reward every man for his righteousness and his trustworthiness, for this day יהוה
gave you into my hand, but I would not stretch out my hand against the anointed
of יהוה.
1Sam
26:24  “And see, as your life has been
valued in my eyes today, so let my life be valued in the eyes of יהוה,
and let Him deliver me out of all distress.” 
1Sam
26:25  And Sha’ul said to Dawiḏ, “Blessed
are you, my son Dawiḏ, achieving much, and indeed prevailing!” Then Dawiḏ
went on his way, and Sha’ul returned to his place. 
1Sam
27:1  And Dawiḏ said in his heart, “Now
I shall perish by the hand of Sha’ul, some day. There is naught better for me
than to escape to the land of the Philistines. Then Sha’ul shall give up
searching for me any longer in any part of Yisra’ĕl, and I shall escape
out of his hand.” 
1Sam
27:2  So Dawiḏ rose up and passed
over with the six hundred men who were with him to Aḵish son of Ma‛oḵ,
sovereign of Gath. 
1Sam
27:3  And Dawiḏ dwelt with Aḵish
at Gath, he and his men, each man with his household – Dawiḏ with his two
wives, Aḥino‛am the Yizre‛ĕlitess, and Aḇiḡayil
the Karmelitess, Naḇal’s widow. 
1Sam
27:4  And it was reported to Sha’ul that
Dawiḏ had fled to Gath, so he sought him no more. 
1Sam
27:5  And Dawiḏ said to Aḵish,
“If I have now found favour in your eyes, let them give me a place in some town
in the country, to dwell there. For why should your servant dwell in the royal
city with you?” 
1Sam
27:6  And Aḵish gave him Tsiqlaḡ
that day. That is why Tsiqlaḡ has belonged to the sovereigns of Yehuḏah
to this day. 
1Sam
27:7  And the time that Dawiḏ dwelt
in the country of the Philistines came to be a year and four months. 
1Sam
27:8  And Dawiḏ and his men went up
and raided the Geshurites, and the Girzites, and the Amalĕqites. For those
nations were the inhabitants of the land from of old, as you go to Shur, even
as far as the land of Mitsrayim. 
1Sam
27:9  And when Dawiḏ had smitten
the land, he left neither man nor woman alive, but took away sheep, and cattle,
and donkeys, and camels, and garments, and returned and came to Aḵish. 
1Sam
27:10  And Aḵish would say, “Where
have you made a raid today?” And Dawiḏ would say, “Against the South of
Yehuḏah, or against the South of the Yeraḥme’ĕlites, or
against the South of the Qĕynites.” 
1Sam
27:11  Dawiḏ did not keep alive man
nor woman, to bring news to Gath, saying, “Lest they inform against us, saying,
‘Thus Dawiḏ did.’ ” And this was his practice all the days that he dwelt
in the country of the Philistines.
1Sam
27:12  And Aḵish trusted Dawiḏ,
saying to himself, “He has indeed
made himself a stench to his people in Yisra’ĕl, and has become my servant
forever.” 
1Sam
28:1  And it came to be in those days
that the Philistines gathered their armies for battle, to fight with Yisra’ĕl.
And Aḵish said to Dawiḏ, “You know, of course, that you are to go
out with me in the army, you and your men.” 
1Sam
28:2  And Dawiḏ said to Aḵish,
“Very well, you shall know what your servant should do.” And Aḵish said
to Dawiḏ, “Very well, I make you one of my chief guardians forever.” 
1Sam
28:3  And Shemu’ĕl had died, and all
Yisra’ĕl had mourned for him and buried him in Ramah, in his own city. And
Sha’ul had put away the mediums and the spiritists from the land. 
1Sam
28:4  And the Philistines were gathered,
and came and encamped at Shunĕm. And Sha’ul gathered all Yisra’ĕl,
and they encamped at Gilboa. 
1Sam
28:5  And when Sha’ul saw the army of the
Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly. 
1Sam
28:6  And Sha’ul inquired of יהוה,
but יהוה did not answer him, either by dreams or by
Urim or by the prophets. 
1Sam
28:7  Sha’ul then said to his servants, “Find
me a woman who is a medium, to go to her and inquire of her.” And his servants
said to him, “Look, there is a woman who is a medium at Ĕn Dor.”
1Sam
28:8  And Sha’ul disguised himself and
put on other garments, and went, he and two men with him. And they came to the
woman by night. And he said, “Please divine for me, and bring up for me the one
I shall name.” 
1Sam
28:9  But the woman said to him, “Look,
you know what Sha’ul has done, how he has cut off the mediums and the
spiritists from the land. Why then do you lay a snare for my life, to put me to
death?” 
1Sam
28:10  And Sha’ul swore to her by יהוה,
saying, “As יהוה lives, no punishment comes upon you
for this matter.” 
1Sam
28:11  And the woman said, “Whom do I
bring up for you?” So he said, “Bring up Shemu’ĕl for me.” 
1Sam
28:12  And when the woman saw Shemu’ĕl,
she cried out with a loud voice. And the woman spoke to Sha’ul, saying, “Why
have you deceived me? You yourself are Sha’ul!” 
1Sam
28:13  And the sovereign said to her, “Do
not be afraid. What did you see?” And the woman said to Sha’ul, “I saw a spirit
coming up out of the earth.” 
1Sam
28:14  And he said to her, “What is his
form?” And she said, “An old man is coming up, and he is covered with a mantle.”
And Sha’ul knew that it was Shemu’ĕl, and he bowed with his face to the
ground and did obeisance.
1Sam
28:15  And Shemu’ĕl said to Sha’ul, “Why
have you disturbed me by bringing me up?” And Sha’ul answered, “I am deeply
distressed, for the Philistines are fighting against me, and Elohim has turned
aside from me and does not answer me any more, neither by prophets nor by
dreams. So I have called you, to reveal to me what I should do.”
1Sam
28:16  Then Shemu’ĕl said, “And why
do you ask me, seeing יהוה has turned aside from you
and has become your enemy? 
1Sam
28:17  “And יהוה
has done for Himself as He spoke by me. For יהוה has
torn the reign out of your hand and given it to your neighbour, to Dawiḏ.

1Sam
28:18  “Because you did not obey the
voice of יהוה nor execute His burning wrath upon Amalĕq,
therefore יהוה has done this matter to you today. 
1Sam
28:19  “Further, יהוה
also gives Yisra’ĕl with you into the hand of the Philistines. And
tomorrow you and your sons are with me. יהוה also gives
the army of Yisra’ĕl into the hand of the Philistines.” 
1Sam
28:20  And immediately Sha’ul fell on the
ground, his complete length, and greatly feared because of the words of Shemu’ĕl.
And there was no strength in him, for he had eaten no food all day or all
night. 
1Sam
28:21  And the woman came to Sha’ul and
saw that he had been greatly disturbed, and said to him, “See, your female
servant has obeyed your voice, and I have put my life in my hands and has
listened to the words which you spoke to me. 
1Sam
28:22  “And now, please listen to the
voice of your female servant too, and let me set a piece of bread before you.
And eat, so that you have strength when you go on your way.” 
1Sam
28:23  But he refused and said, “I am not
going to eat.” But his servants, together with the woman, urged him. And he
listened to their voice. So he rose from the ground and sat on the bed. 
1Sam
28:24  And the woman had a fatted calf in
the house, and she quickly slaughtered it. And she took flour and kneaded it,
and baked unleavened bread from it. 
1Sam
28:25  And she brought it before Sha’ul
and his servants. And they ate, and rose up and went away that night. 
1Sam
29:1  And the Philistines gathered all
their armies at Aphĕq, while Yisra’ĕl encamped by a fountain which is
in Yizre‛ĕl. 
1Sam
29:2  And the princes of the Philistines
were passing on by hundreds and by thousands, and Dawiḏ and his men were
passing on in the rear with Aḵish. 
1Sam
29:3  And the princes of the Philistines
said, “Who are these Heḇrews?” And Aḵish said to the princes of the
Philistines, “Is this not Dawiḏ, the servant of Sha’ul sovereign of Yisra’ĕl,
who has been with me these days, or these years? And to this day I have found
no evil in him since he came over.” 
1Sam
29:4  But the princes of the Philistines
were wroth with him, and the princes of the Philistines said to him, “Send the
man back, let him return to the place which you have appointed for him, and do
not let him go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he become our
adversary. For with what could he appease his master, if not with the heads of
these men? 
1Sam
29:5  “Is this not Dawiḏ, of whom
they sang to each other in dances, saying, ‘Sha’ul smote his thousands, and
Dawiḏ his ten thousands’?” 
1Sam
29:6  And Aḵish called Dawiḏ
and said to him, “As יהוה lives, you have been
straight, and your going out and your coming in with me in the army is good in
my eyes. For to this day I have not found evil in you since the day of your
coming to me. But in the eyes of the princes you are not good. 
1Sam
29:7  “And now, return, and go in peace,
and do no evil in the eyes of the princes of the Philistines.” 
1Sam
29:8  And Dawiḏ said to Aḵish,
“But what have I done? And to this day what have you found in your servant as
long as I have been with you, that I should not go and fight against the
enemies of my master the sovereign?” 
1Sam
29:9  But Aḵish answered and said
to Dawiḏ, “I know that you are as good in my eyes as a messenger of
Elohim, but the princes of the Philistines have said, ‘Let him not go up with
us to the battle.’ 
1Sam
29:10  “And now, rise early in the
morning with your master’s servants who have come with you. And as soon as you
are up early in the morning and have light, then go.” 
1Sam
29:11  And Dawiḏ and his men rose
up early to go in the morning, to return to the land of the Philistines, and
the Philistines went up to Yizre‛ĕl. 
1Sam
30:1  And it came to be, when Dawiḏ
and his men came to Tsiqlaḡ, on the third day, that the Amalĕqites
had invaded the South and Tsiqlaḡ, and smote Tsiqlaḡ and burned it
with fire. 
1Sam
30:2  And they took captive the women and
those who were there, from small to great. They did not kill anyone, but they
led them away and went their way. 
1Sam
30:3  And Dawiḏ and his men came to
the city and saw it burned with fire, and their wives and their sons and their
daughters had been taken captive. 
1Sam
30:4  And Dawiḏ and the people who
were with him lifted up their voices and wept, until they had no more power to
weep. 
1Sam
30:5  And Dawiḏ’s two wives,
Aḥino‛am the Yizre‛ĕlitess, and Aḇiḡayil the
widow of Naḇal the Karmelite, had been taken captive. 
1Sam
30:6  And Dawiḏ was greatly
distressed, for the people spoke of stoning him, because the being of all the
people was grieved, each for his sons and his daughters. But Dawiḏ
strengthened himself in יהוה his Elohim. 
1Sam
30:7  And Dawiḏ said to Eḇyathar
the priest, son of Aḥimeleḵ, “Please bring the shoulder garment
here to me.” So Eḇyathar brought the shoulder garment to Dawiḏ. 
1Sam
30:8  And Dawiḏ inquired of יהוה,
saying, “Do I pursue this band? Do I overtake them?” And He answered him, “Pursue,
for you shall certainly overtake them, and certainly rescue.” 
1Sam
30:9  So Dawiḏ went, he and the six
hundred men who were with him, and came to the wadi Besor, where a halt was
made by those who were left behind, 
1Sam
30:10  while Dawiḏ pursued, he and
four hundred men – for two hundred halted, who were too faint to pass over the
wadi Besor. 
1Sam
30:11  And they found a man in the field,
a Mitsrite, and took him to Dawiḏ. And they gave him bread and he ate,
and they let him drink water, 
1Sam
30:12  and gave him a piece of a cake of
figs and two clusters of raisins. And when he had eaten, his strength came back
to him, for he had not eaten bread nor drunk water for three days and three
nights. 
1Sam
30:13  And Dawiḏ said to him, “To
whom do you belong, and where are you from?” And he said, “I am a young man
from Mitsrayim, servant of an Amalĕqite. And my master left me behind, for
I had been sick three days. 
1Sam
30:14  “We attacked the south of the Kerĕthites
and against that which belongs to Yehuḏah, and upon the south of Kalĕḇ,
and we burned Tsiqlaḡ with fire.” 
1Sam
30:15  And Dawiḏ said to him, “Could
you bring me down to this marauding band?” And he said, “Swear to me by Elohim
that you neither kill me nor surrender me into the hands of my master, then I
bring you down to this marauding band.” 
1Sam
30:16  And he brought him down and saw
they were spread out over all the land, eating and drinking and dancing,
because of all the great spoil which they had taken from the land of the Philistines
and from the land of Yehuḏah. 
1Sam
30:17  And Dawiḏ smote them from
twilight until the evening of the next day. And none of them escaped, except
four hundred young men who rode on camels and fled. 
1Sam
30:18  And Dawiḏ rescued all that
the Amalĕqites had taken. Dawiḏ also rescued his two wives. 
1Sam
30:19  And there was none missing to
them, whether small or great, whether sons or daughters, or spoil or whatever
they had taken from them. Dawiḏ recovered all. 
1Sam
30:20  Besides, Dawiḏ captured all
the flocks and herds they had driven before those livestock, and they said, “This
is Dawiḏ’s spoil.” 
1Sam
30:21  And Dawiḏ came to the two
hundred men who were too faint to follow Dawiḏ, who had also been left at
the wadi Besor. And they went out to meet Dawiḏ and to meet the people
who were with him. And when Dawiḏ came near the people, he greeted them. 
1Sam
30:22  And all the evil and worthless men
of those who went with Dawiḏ answered and said, “Because they did not go
with us, we do not give them any of the spoil that we have rescued, except for
every man’s wife and children, and let them take them and go.” 
1Sam
30:23  But Dawiḏ said, “My
brothers, do not do so with what יהוה has given us, who
has protected us and gave into our hand the band that came against us. 
1Sam
30:24  “And who would listen to you in
this matter? For as his portion is who goes down to the battle, so is his
portion who remains with the baggage, they share alike.” 
1Sam
30:25  And it came to be, from that day
forward, he appointed it for a law and a right-ruling for Yisra’ĕl to this
day. 
1Sam
30:26  And when Dawiḏ came to
Tsiqlaḡ, he sent some of the spoil to the elders of Yehuḏah, to his
friends, saying, “Here is a present for you from the spoil of the enemies of יהוה,”

1Sam
30:27  to those in Bĕyth Ĕl,
and to those in Ramoth of the South, and to those in Yattir, 
1Sam
30:28  and to those in Aro‛ĕr,
and to those in Siphmoth, and to those in Eshtemoa, 
1Sam
30:29  and to those in Raḵal, and
to those in the cities of the Yeraḥme’ĕlites, and to those in the
cities of the Qĕynites, 
1Sam
30:30  and to those in Ḥormah, and
to those in Korashan, and to those in Athaḵ, 
1Sam
30:31  and to those in Ḥeḇron,
and to all the places where Dawiḏ had gone up and down, he and his men. 
1Sam
31:1  And the Philistines were fighting
against Yisra’ĕl, and the men of Yisra’ĕl fled from before the
Philistines, and fell slain on Mount Gilboa. 
1Sam
31:2  And the Philistines followed hard
after Sha’ul and his sons. And the Philistines smote Yehonathan, and Aḇinaḏaḇ,
and Malkishua, sons of Sha’ul. 
1Sam
31:3  And the battle went hard against
Sha’ul, and the archers hit him, so that he was severely wounded by the
archers.
1Sam
31:4  And Sha’ul said to his
armour-bearer, “Draw your sword, and thrust me through with it, lest these
uncircumcised men come and thrust me through and roll themselves on me.” But
his armour-bearer would not, for he was greatly afraid. So Sha’ul took the
sword and fell on it. 
1Sam
31:5  And when his armour-bearer saw that
Sha’ul was dead, he also fell on his sword, and died with him. 
1Sam
31:6  Thus Sha’ul died, and three of his
sons, and his armour-bearer, also all his men, together on that day. 
1Sam
31:7  And they saw – the men of Yisra’ĕl
who were beyond the valley, and those who were beyond the Yardĕn – that
the men of Yisra’ĕl had fled and that Sha’ul and his sons were dead. So
they forsook the cities and fled, and the Philistines came and dwelt in them. 
1Sam
31:8  And the next day it came to be,
when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Sha’ul and his
three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa. 
1Sam
31:9  And they cut off his head and
stripped off his armour, and sent word throughout the land of the Philistines,
to announce it in the house of their idols and to the people. 
1Sam
31:10  And they placed his armour in the
house of the Ashtaroth, and they fastened his body to the wall of Bĕyth
Shan. 
1Sam
31:11  And the inhabitants of Yaḇĕsh
Gil‛aḏ heard what the Philistines had done to Sha’ul, 
1Sam
31:12  and all the brave men arose and
went all night, and took the body of Sha’ul and the bodies of his sons from the
