_The Fall of the Rebel Angels_ by [Hieronymus Bosch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hieronymus_Bosch "Hieronymus Bosch"), based on Genesis 6:1–4

The **Nephilim** ([/ˈnɛfɪˌlɪm/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English "Help:IPA/English"); [Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language "Hebrew language"): נְפִילִים _Nəfīlīm_) are mysterious beings or humans in the [Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible "Bible") traditionally understood as being of great size and strength, or alternatively beings of great [power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_\(social_and_political\) "Power (social and political)") and authority.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-:0-1) The origins of the Nephilim are disputed. Some, including the author of the [Book of Enoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Enoch "Book of Enoch"), view them as the offspring of [rebellious angels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallen_angel "Fallen angel") and humans.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-:2-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-NAB-p1370-footnotes-3) Others view them as descendants of [Seth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth "Seth") and [Cain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cain "Cain").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-:4-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-:5-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-:6-6)

This reference to them is in [Genesis 6:1–4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Genesis#Primeval_history_\(chapters_1%E2%80%9311\) "Book of Genesis"), but the passage is ambiguous and the identity of the Nephilim is disputed.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-:1-7)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-Doedens-8) According to [Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Numbers "Book of Numbers") 13:33, ten of the [Twelve Spies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_Spies "Twelve Spies") report the existence of Nephilim in [Canaan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canaan "Canaan") prior to its [conquest by the Israelites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Joshua#Entry_into_the_land_and_conquest_\(chapters_2%E2%80%9312\) "Book of Joshua").[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-JPS_1917-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-10)

A similar or identical [Biblical Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_Hebrew "Biblical Hebrew") term, read as "Nephilim" by some scholars, or as the word "fallen" by others, appears in [Ezekiel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Ezekiel "Book of Ezekiel") 32:27 and is also mentioned in the [deuterocanonical books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterocanonical_books "Deuterocanonical books") [Judith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith "Judith") 16:6, [Sirach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirach "Sirach") 16:7, [Baruch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Baruch "Book of Baruch") 3:26–28, and [Wisdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_Solomon "Wisdom of Solomon") 14:6.[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-13)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-Hendel-1987-11)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-Doak-2013-12)

## Etymology

The [Brown-Driver-Briggs Lexicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown-Driver-Briggs "Brown-Driver-Briggs") (1908) gives the meaning of Nephilim as "[giants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant "Giant")", and warns that proposed etymologies of the word are "all very precarious".[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-Driver_Briggs_Hebrew_Lexicon'_p._658-14) Many suggested interpretations are based on the assumption that the word is a derivative of Hebrew verbal root _n-p-l_ (נ־פ־ל) "fall". [Girdlestone (1871](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#CITEREFGirdlestone1871), p. 91) argued the word comes from the [hif'il](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiphil "Hiphil") [causative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causative "Causative") stem, possibly indicating that the name 'Nephilim' is to be understood as 'those that cause others to fall down'.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-15) Ronald Hendel states that it is a passive form: 'Ones who have fallen', grammatically analogous to _paqid_ 'one who is appointed' (i.e., a deputy or overseer), _asir_ 'one who is bound' (i.e., a prisoner).[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-16)[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-17) It is also argued that the "fallen" refer to those who "fell in battle", similar to the [_gibborim_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibborim_\(biblical\) "Gibborim (biblical)").[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-:7-18)

The majority of ancient biblical translations – including the [Septuagint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septuagint "Septuagint"), [Theodotion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodotion "Theodotion"), [Latin Vulgate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_Vulgate "Latin Vulgate"), [Samaritan Targum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samaritan_Targum "Samaritan Targum"), [Targum Onkelos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targum_Onkelos "Targum Onkelos"), and [Targum Neofiti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targum_Neofiti "Targum Neofiti") – interpret the word to mean "giants".[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-19) [Symmachus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmachus_\(translator\) "Symmachus (translator)") translates it as "the violent ones"[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-Wright80-81-20)[[b]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-22)[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-Stackhouse-23) and [Aquila](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquila_of_Sinope "Aquila of Sinope")'s translation has been interpreted to mean either "the fallen ones"[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-Wright80-81-20) or "the ones falling [upon their enemies]."[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-Stackhouse-23)[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-Salvesen-1994-1998-24)[[c]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-25)

## Origins of belief

Archaeologist [G.E. Wright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Ernest_Wright "George Ernest Wright") states that belief in the Nephilim, especially as giants, originated from the Hebrews’ contemplation of [Transjordian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transjordan_\(region\) "Transjordan (region)") [megalithic structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megalith "Megalith") and [cyclopean masonry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclopean_masonry "Cyclopean masonry") walls of Canaanite cities, with some being 18 feet thick. Nonetheless, he notes that ancient Canaanites were relatively short, before and after 3000 BC, with no significant findings of abnormally sized aborigines.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-26) Biblical professor Brian R. Doak believes that Nephilim lore is a [polemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polemic "Polemic") against the tropes of [epic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_poetry "Epic poetry") and [heroism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero "Hero"), commonly found in the worldviews of cultures similar to the Hebrews'.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-27) J.C. Greenfield similarly believes that Nephilim lore is based on "the negative aspects of the [Apkallu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apkallu "Apkallu") tradition" in [Sumerian mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumerian_mythology "Sumerian mythology").[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-vdToorn-Becking-vdHorst-1999-28)(pp [72–74](https://books.google.com/books?id=yCkRz5pfxz0C&pg=PA72)) The Apkallu were seven [antediluvian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antediluvian "Antediluvian") [culture heroes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_hero "Culture hero") who were praised for their exceptional wisdom. In fact, some were called "the son of [Ea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ea_\(god_Enki\) "Ea (god Enki)")".[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-vdToorn-Becking-vdHorst-1999-28)(p [73](https://books.google.com/books?id=yCkRz5pfxz0C&pg=PA73))

Brand _et al_. (2023)[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-:7-18) argue that the Nephilim refer to elite or royal warriors from legendary antiquity, who do not necessarily have abnormal stature or divine parentage. They view the Nephilim in Numbers 13–14 as autochthonous elite warriors who dwelt in pre-Israelite Canaan.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-:7-18) Ellen White believes that their purpose, narratively speaking, is to die so that [God's chosen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chosen_people "Chosen people"), who are the "[underdogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underdog "Underdog")", could prevail.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-White-2024-29)

The [Anakites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anakim "Anakim"), who are associated with the Nephilim,[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-White-2023-30) are mentioned in the Egyptian [Execration texts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Execration_texts "Execration texts") of the [Middle Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Kingdom_of_Egypt "Middle Kingdom of Egypt")[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-31) (2055–1650 BC) as one of Egypt's political enemies in Canaan.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWyatt2001-32)

## In the Hebrew Bible

In the Hebrew Bible, there are three interconnected passages referencing the _nephilim._ Two of them come from the [Pentateuch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torah "Torah"). The first occurrence is in Genesis 6:1–4, immediately before the account of [Noah's Ark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah%27s_Ark "Noah's Ark"). Genesis 6:4 reads as follows:

> The Nephilim were in the earth in those days, and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bore children to them; the same were the mighty men that were of old, the men of renown.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-JPS_1917-9)

Where the [Jewish Publication Society's translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Publication_Society_of_America_Version "Jewish Publication Society of America Version") simply transliterates the Hebrew _nephilim_ as "Nephilim",[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-JPS_1917-9) the [King James Version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_James_Version "King James Version") translates the term as "giants".[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-33)

The nature of the Nephilim is complicated by the ambiguity of Genesis 6:4, which leaves it unclear whether they are the "sons of God" or their offspring who are the "mighty men of old, men of renown". [Richard Hess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hess "Richard Hess") takes it to mean that the Nephilim are the offspring,[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-34) as does P.W. Coxon.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-Coxon-1999-DoDDB-35)

The second is Numbers 13:32–33, where ten of [the Twelve Spies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Twelve_Spies "The Twelve Spies") describe the Anakites (a [Rephaite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rephaite "Rephaite") tribe) as descendants of the Nephilim:

> And there we saw the Nephilim, the sons of [Anak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anak "Anak"), who come of the Nephilim; and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-JPS_1917-9)

Outside the Pentateuch there is one more passage indirectly referencing _nephilim_ and this is Ezekiel 32:17–32. Of special significance is Ezekiel 32:27, which contains a phrase of disputed meaning. With the traditional vowels added to the text in the medieval period, the phrase is read _gibborim nophlim_ ("'fallen warriors" or "fallen [Gibborim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibborim_\(biblical\) "Gibborim (biblical)")"), although some scholars read the phrase as _gibborim nephilim_ ("Nephilim warriors" or "warriors, Nephilim").[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-36)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-Hendel-1987-11)[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-Coxon-1999-DoDDB-35) According to R.S. Hendel, the phrase should be interpreted as "warriors, the Nephilim" in a reference to Genesis 6:4. The verse as understood by Hendel reads:

> They lie with the warriors, the Nephilim of old, who descended to [Sheol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheol "Sheol") with their weapons of war. They placed their swords beneath their heads and their shields upon their bones, for the terror of the warriors was upon the land of the living.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-Hendel-1987-11)

B.R. Doak, on the other hand, proposes to read the term as the Hebrew verb "fallen" (נופלים _nophlim_), not a use of the specific term "Nephilim", but still according to Doak a clear reference to the Nephilim tradition as found in Genesis.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-Doak-2013-12)(p [622](https://digitalcommons.georgefox.edu/ccs/9))

## Interpretations

### Giants

Main article: [Giants (Greek mythology)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giants_\(Greek_mythology\) "Giants (Greek mythology)")

The earliest translations of the Hebrew Bible, the [Septuagint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septuagint "Septuagint"), composed in the 3rd or 2nd century BC, renders the said word as _gigantes_. In Greek Mythology the gigantes were beings of great strength and aggression but not necessarily of great size.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-37) The choice made by the Greek translators has been preserved in Latin translation. The [Vulgate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulgate "Vulgate"), compiled in the 4th or 5th century AD, transcribes the Greek term rather than translating the Hebrew _nefilim_. From there, the tradition of the giant progeny of the sons of God and the daughters of men spread to later medieval translations of the Bible.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-:0-1)

The decision of the Greek translators to render the Hebrew _nefilim_ as Greek _gigantes_ is a separate matter. The Hebrew _nefilim_ means literally "the fallen ones" and the strict translation into Greek would be _peptokotes_, which in fact appears in the Septuagint of Ezekiel 32:22–27. It seems then that the authors of Septuagint wished not only to simply translate the foreign term into Greek, but also to employ a term which would be intelligible and meaningful for their Hellenistic audiences. Given the complex meaning of the _nefilim_ which emerged from the three interconnected biblical passages (human–divine hybrids in Genesis 6, autochthonous people in Numbers 13 and ancient warriors damned in the underworld in Ezekiel 32), the Greek translators recognized some similarities. First and foremost, both _nefilim_ and _gigantes_ possessed an ambiguous identity, being a mixture of the human and divine. They were also viewed with fascination and moral contempt. Secondly, both were presented as impersonating chaotic qualities and posing some serious danger to gods and humans. Lastly, both _gigantes_ and _nefilim_ were clearly connected with the underworld and were said to have originated from earth, and they both end up closed therein.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-:0-1)

In [1 Enoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_Enoch "1 Enoch"), the Nephilim were "great giants, whose height was three hundred cubits". Assuming 1 [cubit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubit "Cubit") is 18 inches (46 cm), this would make them 450 feet (140 m) tall. However, "three hundred cubits" is considered by scholars[_[who?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Words_to_watch#Unsupported_attributions "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch")_] to be a translation error in the Ethiopian version. The earlier Greek translation is considered to be closer to the original: "The giants gave birth to Nephilim, and from Nephilim, 'Elioud' came out, and they were growing up according to their grandeur." This matches with [Book of Jubilees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Jubilees "Book of Jubilees") 7:21-22, which states that there are three races of giants: Naphidim, Naphil, and Eljo. Therefore, instead of being about the giants' height, the verse actually refers to the three races of giants including [Elioud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elioud "Elioud"). Knowing this, John Baty, in his 1839 translation of the Ethiopian version of 1 Enoch, rendered that verse according to the Greek text.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-38)

The [Quran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quran "Quran") refers to the [people of Ād](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CA%BF%C4%80d "ʿĀd") in [Quran 26](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quran_26 "Quran 26"):130 whom the [prophet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophets_in_Islam "Prophets in Islam") [Hud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hud_\(prophet\) "Hud (prophet)") declares to be like _jabbarin_ (Hebrew: _gibborim_), probably a reference to the Biblical Nephilim. The people of Ād are said to be giants, the tallest among them 100 ft (30 m) high.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-39) However, according to [Islamic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam "Islam") legend, the ʿĀd were not wiped out by [the Flood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah%27s_Ark "Noah's Ark"), since some of them had been too tall to be drowned. Instead, God destroyed them after they rejected further warnings.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-40) After death, they were banished into the lower layers of [hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jahannam "Jahannam").[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-41)

_The Sons of God Saw the Daughters of Men That They Were Fair_, sculpture by [Daniel Chester French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Chester_French "Daniel Chester French")

From the third century BC onwards, references are found in the [Enochic literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Enoch "Book of Enoch"), the [Dead Sea Scrolls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Sea_Scrolls "Dead Sea Scrolls"),[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-42) [Jubilees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jubilees "Jubilees"), the Testament of Reuben, [2 Baruch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2_Baruch "2 Baruch"), [Josephus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus "Josephus"), and the [Book of Jude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Jude "Book of Jude") (compare with 2 Peter 2). For example:

1 Enoch 7:[2]"And when the angels, [3]the sons of heaven, beheld them, they became enamoured of them, saying to each other, Come, let us select for ourselves wives from the progeny of men, and let us beget children."

Some Christian apologists, such as [Tertullian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertullian "Tertullian") and especially [Lactantius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactantius "Lactantius"), shared this opinion.

The earliest statement in a secondary commentary explicitly interpreting this to mean that angelic beings mated with humans can be traced to the rabbinical _[Targum Pseudo-Jonathan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targum_Pseudo-Jonathan "Targum Pseudo-Jonathan")_ and it has since become especially commonplace in modern Christian commentaries. This line of interpretation finds additional support in the text of Genesis 6:4, which juxtaposes the sons of God (male gender, divine nature) with the daughters of men (female gender, human nature). From this parallelism it could be inferred that the sons of God are understood as some superhuman beings.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-:2-2)

The _[New American Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_American_Bible "New American Bible")_ commentary draws a parallel to the [Epistle of Jude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistle_of_Jude "Epistle of Jude") and the statements set forth in Genesis, suggesting that the Epistle refers implicitly to the paternity of Nephilim as heavenly beings who came to earth and had sexual intercourse with women.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-NAB-p1370-footnotes-3)[[d]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-43) The footnotes of the [Jerusalem Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem_Bible "Jerusalem Bible") suggest that the biblical author intended the Nephilim to be an "anecdote of a superhuman race". Superhuman, in this context, refers to the extremity of their wickedness.[[e]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-45)

Some Christian commentators have argued against this view, citing [Jesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus "Jesus")'s statement that angels do not marry.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-46) Others disagree since Jesus also compared angels to men, thus implying the former's ability to have sex.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-47) Angels are also never explicitly described as being incapable of marriage. The absence of marriage among angels can be thus compared to wilful [celibacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celibacy "Celibacy").[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-48)

Evidence cited in favor of the fallen angels interpretation includes the fact that the phrase "the sons of God" (Hebrew: בְּנֵי הָֽאֱלֹהִים‎; or "sons of the gods") is used twice outside of Genesis 6, in the [Book of Job](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Job "Book of Job") (1:6 and 2:1) where the phrase explicitly references angels. The [Septuagint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septuagint "Septuagint") manuscript [Codex Alexandrinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Alexandrinus "Codex Alexandrinus") reading of Genesis 6:2 renders this phrase as "the angels of God" while [Codex Vaticanus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Vaticanus "Codex Vaticanus") reads "sons".[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-49)

Another modern view that aligns with the fallen angel interpretation includes Nephilim being the offspring of [demon-possessed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_possession "Demon possession") men and women.[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-50)

The Greek, Aramaic, and main Ge'ez manuscripts of 1 Enoch and [Jubilees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jubilees "Jubilees") obtained in the 19th century and held in the [British Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Museum "British Museum") and [Vatican Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatican_Library "Vatican Library"), connect the origin of the Nephilim with the fallen angels, and in particular with the _[egrḗgoroi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watcher_\(angel\) "Watcher (angel)")_ (_watchers_). [Samyaza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samyaza "Samyaza"), an [angel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel "Angel") of high rank, is described as leading a rebel sect of angels in a descent to earth to have sexual intercourse with human females:

> And it came to pass when the children of men had multiplied that in those days were born unto them beautiful and comely daughters. And the angels, the children of the heaven, saw and lusted after them, and said to one another: "Come, let us choose us wives from among the children of men and beget us children." And Semjaza, who was their leader, said unto them: "I fear ye will not indeed agree to do this deed, and I alone shall have to pay the penalty of a great sin." And they all answered him and said: "Let us all swear an oath, and all bind ourselves by mutual imprecations not to abandon this plan but to do this thing." Then sware they all together and bound themselves by mutual imprecations upon it. And they were in all two hundred; who descended in the days of Jared on the summit of Mount Hermon, and they called it Mount Hermon, because they had sworn and bound themselves by mutual imprecations upon it ...[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-51)

In this tradition, the children of the Nephilim are called the [Elioud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elioud "Elioud"), who are considered a separate race from the Nephilim, but they share the fate of the Nephilim.

Some believe the fallen angels who [begat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_reproduction "Human reproduction") the Nephilim were cast into [Tartarus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartarus "Tartarus") (2 Peter 2:4, Jude 1:6) (Greek Enoch 20:2),[[f]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-53) a place of "total darkness". An interpretation is that God granted ten percent of the disembodied spirits of the Nephilim to remain after [the Flood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah%27s_Ark "Noah's Ark"), as [demons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon "Demon"), to try to lead the human race astray until the [final Judgment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Judgment "Final Judgment"). Another similar view was proposed by Dr. Michael Heiser, an [Old Testament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Testament "Old Testament") scholar from the [University of Pennsylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania "University of Pennsylvania") and the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Wisconsin-Madison "University of Wisconsin-Madison"). In his book _The Unseen Realm_ he states that the disembodied spirits of the Nephilim became what has been known as demons or unclean spirits.[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-54)

In addition to _Enoch_, the _[Book of Jubilees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Jubilees "Book of Jubilees")_ (7:21–25) also states that ridding the Earth of these Nephilim was one of God's purposes for flooding the Earth in Noah's time.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-55) These works describe the Nephilim as being evil giants.

The New Testament [Epistle of Jude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistle_of_Jude "Epistle of Jude") (14–15) cites from [1 Enoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_Enoch "1 Enoch") 1:9, which many scholars believe is based on [Deuteronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuteronomy "Deuteronomy") 33:2.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-56)[[g]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-57)[[h]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-59)[[i]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-61) To most commentators this confirms that the author of Jude regarded the Enochic interpretations of Genesis 6 as correct; however, others[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-62) have questioned this.

### Descendants of Seth and Cain

References to the offspring of [Seth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth "Seth") rebelling from God and mingling with the daughters of [Cain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cain "Cain") are found from the second century AD onwards in both Christian and Jewish sources (e.g., Rabbi [Shimon bar Yochai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimon_bar_Yochai "Shimon bar Yochai"), [Augustine of Hippo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo "Augustine of Hippo"), [Sextus Julius Africanus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sextus_Julius_Africanus "Sextus Julius Africanus"), and the [Letters attributed to St. Clement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clementine_literature "Clementine literature")). It is also the view expressed in the modern canonical [Amharic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amharic "Amharic") [Ethiopian Orthodox Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible_translations_\(Amharic\) "Bible translations (Amharic)"): Henok 2:1–3

"and the Offspring of Seth, who were upon the Holy Mount, saw them and loved them. And they told one another, 'Come, let us choose for us daughters from Cain's children; let us bear children for us.'"

Orthodox Judaism has taken a stance against the idea that Genesis 6 refers to angels or that angels could intermarry with men. [Shimon bar Yochai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimon_bar_Yochai "Shimon bar Yochai") pronounced a curse on anyone teaching this idea. [Rashi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashi "Rashi") and [Nachmanides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nachmanides "Nachmanides") followed this. [Pseudo-Philo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-Philo "Pseudo-Philo") (_Biblical Antiquities_ 3:1–3) may also imply that the "sons of God" were human.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-63) This is also the rendering suggested in the [Targum Onkelos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targum_Onqelos "Targum Onqelos"), [Symmachus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmachus_\(translator\)#His_translation "Symmachus (translator)") and the [Samaritan Targum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samaritan_Targum "Samaritan Targum"), which read "sons of the rulers", where [Targum Neophyti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targum_Neophyti "Targum Neophyti") reads "sons of the judges".

Likewise, a long-held view among some Christians is that the "sons of God" were the formerly righteous descendants of Seth who rebelled, while the "daughters of men" were the unrighteous descendants of Cain, and the Nephilim the offspring of their union.[[j]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-64) This view, dating to at least the 1st century AD in Jewish literature as described above, is also found in Christian sources from the 3rd century if not earlier, with references throughout the [Clementine literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clementine_literature "Clementine literature"),[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-65) as well as in [Sextus Julius Africanus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sextus_Julius_Africanus "Sextus Julius Africanus"),[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-:6-6) [Ephrem the Syrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephrem_the_Syrian "Ephrem the Syrian"),[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-66) and others. Holders of this view have looked for support in Jesus' statement that "in those days before [the flood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah%27s_Ark "Noah's Ark") _they_ [humans] were ... _marrying and giving in marriage_" ([Matthew 24:38](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+24:38&version=nasb), emphasis added).[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-67)[_[self-published source?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Self-published_sources "Wikipedia:Verifiability")_]

Some individuals and groups, including [St. Augustine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo "Augustine of Hippo"), [John Chrysostom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Chrysostom "John Chrysostom"), and [John Calvin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Calvin "John Calvin"), take the view of Genesis 6:2 that the "Angels" who fathered the Nephilim referred to certain human males from the lineage of [Seth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth "Seth"), who were called _sons of God_ probably in reference to their prior [covenant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covenant_\(religion\) "Covenant (religion)") with [Yahweh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahweh "Yahweh") (cf. [Deuteronomy 14:1](https://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0514.htm#1); [32:5](https://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0532.htm#5)); according to these sources, these men had begun to pursue bodily interests, and so took wives of "the daughters of men", e.g., those who were descended from [Cain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cain "Cain") or from any people who did not worship God.

This also is the view of the [Ethiopian Orthodox Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopian_Orthodox_Church "Ethiopian Orthodox Church"),[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-68) supported by their own [Ge'ez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ge%27ez "Ge'ez") manuscripts and [Amharic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amharic "Amharic") translation of the [Haile Selassie Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible_translations_\(Amharic\) "Bible translations (Amharic)")—where the books of [1 Enoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_Enoch "1 Enoch") and [Jubilees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jubilees "Jubilees"), counted as canonical by this church, differ from western academic editions.[[k]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-69) The "Sons of Seth view" is also the view presented in a few extra-biblical, yet ancient works, including [Clementine literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clementine_literature "Clementine literature"), the 3rd century _[Cave of Treasures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_of_Treasures "Cave of Treasures")_, and the c. 6th century [Ge'ez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ge%27ez "Ge'ez") work _The [Conflict of Adam and Eve with Satan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_of_Adam_and_Eve_with_Satan "Conflict of Adam and Eve with Satan")_. In these sources, these offspring of Seth were said to have disobeyed God, by breeding with the Cainites and producing wicked children "who were all unlike", thus angering God into bringing about the Deluge, as in the _Conflict_:

> Certain wise men of old wrote concerning them, and say in their [sacred] books that angels came down from heaven and mingled with the daughters of Cain, who bare unto them these giants. But these [wise men] err in what they say. God forbid such a thing, that angels who are spirits, should be found committing sin with human beings. Never, that cannot be. And if such a thing were of the nature of angels, or Satans, that fell, they would not leave one woman on earth, undefiled ... But many men say, that angels came down from heaven, and joined themselves to women, and had children by them. This cannot be true. But they were children of Seth, who were of the children of Adam, that dwelt on the mountain, high up, while they preserved their virginity, their innocence and their glory like angels; and were then called 'angels of God'. But when they transgressed and mingled with the children of Cain, and begat children, ill-informed men said, that angels had come down from heaven, and mingled with the daughters of men, who bear them giants.

### Offspring of Orion

In [Aramaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aram_\(biblical_region\) "Aram (biblical region)") culture, the term _nephilim_ refers to the offspring of [Orion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_\(mythology\) "Orion (mythology)") in mythology.[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-70) However, the [Brown–Driver–Briggs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown%E2%80%93Driver%E2%80%93Briggs "Brown–Driver–Briggs") lexicon notes this as a "dubious etymology" and "all very precarious".[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-Driver_Briggs_Hebrew_Lexicon'_p._658-71)

## Arabian paganism

Fallen angels were believed by [Arab pagans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_pre-Islamic_Arabia "Religion in pre-Islamic Arabia") to be sent to earth in form of men. Some of them mated with humans and gave rise to hybrid children. As recorded by [Al-Jahiz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Jahiz "Al-Jahiz"), a common belief held that Abu Jurhum, the ancestor of the [Jurhum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurhum "Jurhum") tribe, was actually the son of a disobedient angel and a human woman.[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-72)[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-73)

## Fossil remains of giants

Further information: [List of tallest people § Disputed and unverified claims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tallest_people#Disputed_and_unverified_claims "List of tallest people")

Alleged discoveries of Nephilim remains have been a common source of hoaxing and misidentification.[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-74)

In 1577, a series of large bones discovered near [Lucerne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucerne "Lucerne") were interpreted as the bones of an [antediluvian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antediluvian "Antediluvian") giant about 5.8 m (19 ft) tall.[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-75) In 1786, [Johann Friedrich Blumenbach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Friedrich_Blumenbach "Johann Friedrich Blumenbach") found out that these remains belonged to a [mammoth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammoth "Mammoth").[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-76) [Cotton Mather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_Mather "Cotton Mather") believed that [fossilized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil "Fossil") leg bones and teeth discovered near [Albany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albany,_New_York "Albany, New York"), New York in 1705 were the remains of Nephilim who perished in [a great flood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genesis_flood_narrative "Genesis flood narrative"). [Paleontologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleontologist "Paleontologist") have identified these as [mastodon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon "Mastodon") remains.[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-77)[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-78) In 1869, the [Cardiff Giant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiff_Giant "Cardiff Giant"), a hoax intended to fool believers in Nephilim, was supposedly discovered in [Cardiff, New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiff,_New_York "Cardiff, New York").[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-79)

## In popular culture

Main article: [Nephilim in popular culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim_in_popular_culture "Nephilim in popular culture")

The name and idea of Nephilim, like many other religious concepts, is sometimes used in popular culture. Examples include the [gothic rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_rock "Gothic rock") band [Fields of the Nephilim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fields_of_the_Nephilim "Fields of the Nephilim"); _[The Renquist Quartet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Renquist "Victor Renquist")_ novels by [Mick Farren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_Farren "Mick Farren"); _[The Mortal Instruments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mortal_Instruments "The Mortal Instruments")_, _[The Infernal Devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Infernal_Devices "The Infernal Devices")_, _[The Last Hours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Hours "The Last Hours")_, _[The Dark Artifices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Artifices "The Dark Artifices")_ and other books in _[The Shadowhunter Chronicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shadowhunter_Chronicles "The Shadowhunter Chronicles")_ series by [Cassandra Clare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassandra_Clare "Cassandra Clare"); the _[Hush, Hush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush,_Hush_\(series\) "Hush, Hush (series)")_ series by [Becca Fitzpatrick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Becca_Fitzpatrick "Becca Fitzpatrick"); the book _[Many Waters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many_Waters "Many Waters")_ by [Madeleine L'Engle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madeleine_L%27Engle "Madeleine L'Engle"); and TV series _[The X-Files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Souls_\(The_X-Files\) "All Souls (The X-Files)")_ and _[Supernatural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernatural_\(season_8\)#ep171 "Supernatural (season 8)")._ Erich Anton Paul von Däniken (b. 1935), in his best-selling [Chariots of the Gods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chariots_of_the_Gods "Chariots of the Gods") (1968) claims that Nephilim were "skyfallers" from higher dimensions.

In the video game series _[Darksiders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darksiders "Darksiders")_, the [Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_horsemen_of_the_apocalypse "Four horsemen of the apocalypse") are said to be Nephilim, wherein the Nephilim were created by the unholy union of angels and demons. Dante and Vergil, the main characters of the game _[DmC: Devil May Cry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DmC:_Devil_May_Cry "DmC: Devil May Cry")_ (2013), a reboot of the popular original series _[Devil May Cry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil_May_Cry "Devil May Cry")_, are also referred to as Nephilim; being the offspring of the demon Sparda and the angel Eva. In the trading card game _[Magic: The Gathering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering "Magic: The Gathering")_, the Nephilim are interpreted as "Old Gods" from before modern society.[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-MTG-80) In _[Diablo 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diablo_3 "Diablo 3")_, the Nephalem were the first humans upon Sanctuary, created as a result of the union between angels and demons. They figure prominently in the plot of _Antarktos Rising_[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-81) by author Jeremy Robinson. In the heist-themed first-person-shooter _[Payday 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payday_2 "Payday 2")_, several paintings, artifacts, and far off visuals reference the Nephilim, and a secret ending to the game brings in alien technology supposedly left by the Nephilim. A creature referred to as "Nephilim" appears in season 2 of the Japanese animated series _[Symphogear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphogear "Symphogear")_. _[Nephilim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim_\(role-playing_game\) "Nephilim (role-playing game)")_ is a [role-playing game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game "Role-playing game") about powerful elemental entities reincarnating into human beings.[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-82) Nephilim feature in the plot of _[Indiana Jones and the Great Circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Great_Circle "Indiana Jones and the Great Circle")_, with the title character encountering a secret order in the [Vatican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatican_City "Vatican City") whose members are giants alleged to be the descendants of Nephilim.[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-Characters_of_Indiana_Jones_and_the_Great_Circle-83)[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-Indiana_Jones_encounters_giants_&_fallen_angels-84)

There are several movies, videos, documentaries, and podcasts on Nephilim.[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-85)[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-86)

1.  [Hendel (1987)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#CITEREFHendel1987) presents the view that the word used in Ezekiel 32 is explicitly the word "Nephilim", the same word used in other Bible books.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-Hendel-1987-11)
    
    [Doak (2013)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#CITEREFDoak2013) proposes an alternate view, that the actual term used in Ezekiel 32:27 is a related, but different word, that is deliberately used to refer back to the traditional ideas about the Nephilim, but that it is _not_ itself the explicit term "Nephilim".[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-Doak-2013-12)

3.  The rendering _he fell upon, attacked_ [in Symmachus, Genesis 6:6] is something of a puzzle ...

Two passages are central to it: The first is Deuteronomy 33:1 ... the second is Numbers 24:3–4."[_[verification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability "Wikipedia:Verifiability")_][[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-60)
10.  Later Judaism and almost all the earliest ecclesiastical writers identify the "sons of God" with the fallen angels; but from the fourth century onwards, as the idea of angelic natures becomes less material, the Fathers commonly take the "sons of God" to be Seth's descendants and the "daughters of men" those of Cain.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim#cite_note-:4-4)
11.  The Amharic text of Henok 2:1–3 (i.e. 1 En) in the 1962 [Ethiopian Orthodox Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodox_Tewahedo_biblical_canon "Orthodox Tewahedo biblical canon") may be translated as follows:
    
    "After mankind abounded, it became thus: And in that season, handsome comely children were born to them; and the offspring of Seth, who were upon the Holy Mount, saw them and loved them. And they told one another, 'Come, let us choose for us daughters from Cain's children; let us bear children for us.'"
