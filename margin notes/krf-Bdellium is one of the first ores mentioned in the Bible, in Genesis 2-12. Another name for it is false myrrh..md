Bdellium is one of the first ores mentioned in the Bible, in Genesis 2:12. Another name for it is ‘false myrrh’.

And the manna was as coriander seed, and the colour thereof as the colour of bdellium. (Numbers 11:7) In ancient Egypt women carried small pouches filled with bdellium pieces as a source of perfume.

The Bible describes the Pishon River as winding through the land of Havilah, noted only for its gold and aromatic resin-producing plant, bdellium:

The bdellium is actually a deciduous tree indigenous to sub-Saharan African; its genus and species names are Commiphora africana. Bdellium doesn’t appear in Israeli plant data bases.

The inclusion of the bdellium plant in the creation story is probably a way to emphasise the separation or differentiation of the Biblical Garden of Eden from the lands outside: none of the lands outside of Eden were described as attractive or food producing. When the biblical creation story was first recorded, during the 6th and 5th centuries BCE, bdellium was also somewhat looked down as as it was sometimes used to ‘pad out’ the more expensive genuine myrrh.

Today, nomadic peoples still use the bdellium tree for several purposes, from timber to a chew for toothache. Despite its colour and appearance, preserved Bdellium, which consists of a water-soluble gum, a resin and essential oil is still used elsewhere in traditional medicine and as an incense.
