[[Genesis_Bereshith_10]]

Eber (Hebrew: **עֵבֶר**, _Ever_) was the great-grandson of Shem and a key ancestor of Abraham. His name is the origin of the word **Hebrew**.

The name Eber comes from the root word _avar_, which means "to cross over" or "the other side." Therefore, the "children of Eber" literally means "the Hebrews"—the people who "crossed over," which could refer to:

- Their origins from "across the river" (the Euphrates).
    
- Their status as a distinct people who "crossed over" from the rest of the nations.
    

By highlighting Shem as "the father of all the children of Eber," the author of Genesis is narrowing the focus from all the nations of the world down to the specific lineage that will lead to the Israelites. It's a way of saying, "Now, let's pay attention to the line that will become the Hebrew people."
