[[Genesis 10|Genesis 10:16]]

The **Amorites** were a powerful and widespread Semitic people. The term is used in two ways: sometimes for a specific group, and sometimes as a general term for _all_ the pre-Israelite inhabitants of Canaan. They established powerful kingdoms, including the two that the Israelites defeated east of the Jordan River, led by kings Sihon and Og.

**Location:** This was a broad group, not tied to one city. They dominated **the hill country of Canaan (modern Israel/Palestine) and the Transjordan (modern Jordan)**.
