# Geolocating the "Mountains of Ararat": A Synthesis of Textual, Historical, and Scientific Analysis

## Section 1: Textual and Historical Deconstruction of "The Mountains of Ararat"

The query to geolocate the resting place of Noah's Ark, as described in the Book of Genesis, requires an investigation that extends far beyond modern cartography. The biblical passage in question, Genesis 8:4, states, "and in the seventh new moon, the seventeenth day of the new moon, the ark rested on the mountains of Ararat." The interpretation of this phrase has evolved significantly over millennia, shifting from a broad regional designation to a specific, iconic mountain peak. A thorough analysis must begin by deconstructing the original textual, historical, and geographical context of the term "Ararat" as understood by the ancient authors and their audience. This foundational analysis reveals that the biblical "Ararat" refers not to a single mountain but to the vast, mountainous territory of the Iron Age Kingdom of Urartu. This conclusion is overwhelmingly supported by linguistic etymology, archaeological evidence, and the earliest interpretive traditions, which predate the modern identification.

### 1.1 The Biblical Locus: An Analysis of Genesis 8:4

The primary key to understanding the intended location lies within the Hebrew text itself. The phrase in question is `hare 'Ararat` (הָרֵי אֲרָרָט), which directly translates to "the mountains of Ararat". The use of the plural  

`hare` (mountains) is a critical textual detail that is often overlooked in popular retellings of the story. Scholarly consensus holds that this plural form indicates a mountainous region, a range, or a highland area, rather than a singular, specific peak. The narrative does not pinpoint one mountain but rather a mountainous territory.  

A minority interpretation posits that the plural could be a figure of speech known as synecdoche, where a part represents the whole or, in this case, the plural is used for the singular. This linguistic device is present elsewhere in the Bible; for instance, Matthew 27:44 and Mark 15:32 state that the "robbers" (plural) crucified with Jesus reviled him, whereas Luke's account specifies that only one did so. Proponents of this view argue that "mountains" could similarly refer to a single mountain within the Ararat category. While grammatically possible, this interpretation is less compelling than the direct geographical-historical correlation with a known mountainous kingdom, a correlation supported by multiple other lines of evidence.  

The narrative context within Genesis further supports the "mountain range" interpretation. Following the Ark's landing, the text states that on the first day of the tenth month, "the tops of the mountains were seen" (Genesis 8:5). This passage strongly implies that the Ark had come to rest at a high elevation within a range, from which the peaks of other, surrounding mountains became visible as the floodwaters continued to recede. This detail reinforces the image of a vast, high-altitude landscape rather than a solitary cone.  

### 1.2 The Kingdom of Urartu: The Original "Ararat"

The geographical identity of the "mountains of Ararat" is resolved by recognizing the direct and undisputed linguistic link between the Hebrew `Ararat` and the ancient Kingdom of Urartu. The name `Ararat` (אֲרָרָט) is the Hebrew cognate for the Assyrian `Uruatri` or `Urartu` (māt Urarṭu) and the Babylonian `Urashtu`. These are not different places but simply different linguistic renderings of the same name for a single, historically attested entity. Early Semitic scripts, which often omitted vowels, wrote the name as  

`rrt`, leading to these varied vocalizations in different languages.  

This connection anchors the biblical narrative in tangible history and geography. The Kingdom of Urartu was a major Iron Age power that flourished from approximately the mid-9th to the early 6th century BCE. Its heartland was centered on the Armenian Highlands, particularly the mountainous region surrounding Lake Van in what is now eastern Turkey. This high plateau, with a general elevation of 6,000 feet, is precisely the kind of region described as "the mountains of Ararat". At its zenith, Urartu's influence extended across a vast territory encompassing modern-day eastern Turkey, the Republic of Armenia, northwestern Iran, and parts of northern Iraq and Georgia.  

The existence of this kingdom is not a matter of speculation. It is confirmed by substantial archaeological evidence, including the discovery of numerous fortified cities (such as the capital Tushpa at Van Kalesi, Erebuni near modern Yerevan, and Ayanis), distinctive bronze metalwork, and hundreds of royal cuneiform inscriptions detailing military campaigns, building projects, and religious practices. Much of our historical knowledge of Urartu comes from the annals of its powerful southern neighbor and rival, the Neo-Assyrian Empire. Assyrian inscriptions, such as those of King Shalmaneser I (c. 1263 BCE), record campaigns to subdue the territory of "Uruatri," which was initially a confederation of tribes known as the Nairi lands before its unification into a single kingdom.  

The choice of "Ararat" in Genesis was therefore not a reference to a mythical land but a geopolitical statement. For the biblical authors, likely writing and editing the text during a period when Urartu was a known, powerful, and remote northern kingdom, placing the Ark's landing there served a crucial narrative function. It grounded the universal story of the Flood and humanity's rebirth in a real-world, albeit distant, location. This act of "geolocating" the foundational post-diluvian event in a recognizable, historically significant, and famously mountainous kingdom lent the theological narrative a powerful sense of verisimilitude for its ancient audience. The name appears in other biblical contexts as a real place; the sons of the assassinated Assyrian king Sennacherib flee to the "land of Ararat" for refuge (2 Kings 19:37, Isaiah 37:38), and the prophet Jeremiah calls upon the "kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz" to wage war against Babylon (Jeremiah 51:27).  

|Language/Source|Term|Approximate Date/Text|Significance/Notes|
|---|---|---|---|
|Hebrew|`ʾĂrārāṭ` (אֲרָרָט)|Genesis 8:4; 2 Kings 19:37|The Hebrew name for the kingdom and region.|
|Assyrian|`māt Urarṭu` / `Uruatri`|c. 13th-7th century BCE|The Assyrian name for their northern rival kingdom.|
|Babylonian|`Urashtu`|c. 8th-6th century BCE|The Babylonian name for the same region, used in the Behistun Inscription.|
|Old Persian|`Armina`|c. 522 BCE (Behistun Inscription)|The Old Persian name for the region, used synonymously with `Urashtu`.|

|Latin (Vulgate)|`montes Armeniae`|c. 400 CE|Jerome's translation, rendering "mountains of Ararat" as "mountains of Armenia."|

### 1.3 Early Interpretive Traditions and Alternative Locations

The understanding of "Ararat" as a region synonymous with "Armenia" is cemented in the earliest and most influential translations of the Bible. Both the Greek Septuagint (c. 3rd-1st century BCE) and Jerome's Latin Vulgate (c. 400 CE) translate the Hebrew `Ararat` as "Armenia". This interpretive choice was not arbitrary; it reflected the geopolitical reality of their time. By the Achaemenid Persian period (c. 550–330 BCE), the name Urartu had fallen out of use, and the region came to be known as the Satrapy of Armenia. The famous trilingual Behistun Inscription of Darius the Great (c. 522 BCE) uses the Old Persian  

`Armina`, Babylonian `Urashtu`, and Elamite `Harminuya` interchangeably to refer to the same province, demonstrating the seamless transition in terminology.  

For over a millennium after the biblical text was composed, there was no consensus linking the Ark's landing to the specific peak known today as Mount Ararat. Instead, a significant and ancient alternative tradition, particularly strong in Syriac Christianity and later enshrined in the Quran, identified the landing site as **Mount Judi (Cudi Dağı)**. Mount Judi is located in the modern Turkish province of Şırnak, near the border with Syria and Iraq. Crucially, this location falls squarely within the southern portion of the historical territory of Urartu/Ararat, specifically in the mountainous region of Corduene (the modern Kurdish mountains). Early Aramaic translations of the Old Testament, known as the Targums, explicitly name the "Qardu mountains" as the landing place. This tradition is considerably older than the identification with the modern Mount Ararat.  

Other ancient sources offer further variations, all pointing to a region rather than a single peak. The first-century CE Jewish historian Josephus, citing earlier sources, writes that the Ark rested "on the top of a certain mountain in Armenia... called Baris". The apocryphal Book of Jubilees, dating to the 2nd century BCE, specifies that the Ark came to rest on a peak named "Lubar," which it identifies as one of the "mountains of Ararat".  

The existence of these multiple, competing "original" landing sites—Judi, Lubar, Baris—all located within the broader geographical and cultural sphere of ancient Armenia/Urartu, reveals a crucial point: the ancient world was comfortable with a more generalized and fluid geography for the story. The core of the tradition was the landing in the high, remote mountains of the north. The modern obsession with pinpointing a single summit represents a significant narrowing and hardening of what was once a more flexible and regionally-focused tradition.

## Section 2: The Modern Candidate: The Mount Ararat Massif (Ağrı Dağı)

While textual and early historical evidence points to a broad region, the modern popular imagination, as well as the focus of nearly all Ark-related expeditions, has converged on a single geographical feature: the volcanic massif known in Turkish as Ağrı Dağı and universally as Mount Ararat. This section provides a detailed profile of this modern candidate, explains the historical process by which it became the sole focus of the tradition, and explores its profound cultural and national significance, which is inextricably linked to its biblical association.

### 2.1 Geographical and Geological Profile

The Mount Ararat massif is a dormant compound stratovolcano situated in the extreme east of Turkey. Its location is a point of immense geopolitical significance, forming a near-quadripoint where the borders of Turkey, Armenia, Iran, and the Nakhchivan exclave of Azerbaijan converge. The summit of the main peak is located approximately 16 km (10 mi) west of the Turkish-Iranian border and 32 km (20 mi) south of the Turkish-Armenian border.  

The massif is a colossal volcanic edifice, about 40 km in diameter, that rises with dramatic prominence from the surrounding alluvial plains of the Aras and Murat rivers. It consists of two distinct volcanic cones separated by a high plateau :  

- **Greater Ararat** (Turkish: _Büyük Ağrı Dağı_): This is the highest peak in Turkey and the entire Armenian Highlands. Its elevation is most commonly cited as 5,137 meters (16,854 feet), though figures vary slightly due to factors like the shrinking of its summit ice cap.  
    
- **Little Ararat** (Turkish: _Küçük Ağrı Dağı_): A steep, nearly perfect cone rising to an elevation of 3,896 meters (12,782 feet).  
    

Both peaks are the product of eruptive volcanic activity and are composed of alternating layers of lava and pyroclastic debris. The mountain is perpetually snow-capped above roughly 4,200 meters, though its ice cap has been shrinking significantly in recent decades. A single true glacier exists on the northern slope of Greater Ararat near its summit.  

Of paramount importance to this investigation is the geological history of the mountain. Scientific analysis, based on the study of its volcanic layers, reveals that Mount Ararat is a geologically young, post-Pleistocene volcano. It is a post-Flood structure. The volcanic edifice was built up by eruptions that occurred on top of thick layers of older sediments—sediments that would have been deposited during the very global flood described in Genesis—and subsequent regional lava flows. The volcanic activity continued into the Holocene, with the most recent event being a major phreatic explosion and associated landslide from the Ahora Gorge in 1840, which destroyed a village and monastery.  

This geological reality presents a fundamental and insurmountable contradiction for any literalist claim that the biblical Ark landed on this specific mountain. The biblical narrative requires the "mountains of Ararat" to exist _before or during_ the culmination of the Flood to serve as a resting place. However, the geological evidence demonstrates that the modern Mount Ararat volcano did not exist at that time; it formed much later. This fact serves as a definitive filter separating two fundamentally different approaches to the user's query. For a scientific or historical-critical analysis, the search for a literal Ark _on this specific peak_ is logically invalid from the outset. For a faith-based or creationist approach, this geological evidence must be either re-interpreted within a non-standard geological framework (such as Young Earth Creationism, which compresses geological time) or disregarded. The "quest for the Ark on Ararat" is therefore not a straightforward archaeological problem to be solved, but rather a manifestation of an epistemological divide between scientific consensus and literalist belief.

### 2.2 The Traditionalization of a Peak: From Region to Icon

The specific identification of Ağrı Dağı as the biblical landing site is a surprisingly late development, only becoming solidified in tradition between the 11th and 13th centuries CE. As established in Section 1, the older and more textually grounded traditions pointed to the broader region of Urartu, with a particular focus on the mountains of Corduene and Mount Judi to the south.  

This historical shift appears to have been heavily influenced by the accounts of Western Christian travelers, missionaries, and Crusaders returning from the Near East. The sheer scale, majestic beauty, and iconic, solitary profile of Ağrı Dağı made it a far more compelling visual anchor for the biblical story than the less dramatic peaks of the Judi range. Its status as the highest and most prominent mountain in the entire region naturally drew the epic narrative of the Flood towards it. This process exemplifies a common principle in the development of myths and legends: stories often gravitate toward the most memorable and impressive features of a landscape. The power of this visual icon gradually overwrote the older, more complex, and more textually accurate tradition. By the time the Venetian traveler Marco Polo passed through the region in the late 13th century, the identification of Ağrı Dağı as the "Mountain of Noah's Ark" was well-established in the popular imagination.  

This Western-influenced identification was eventually adopted back into local Armenian tradition. There, it did not enter a vacuum but merged with and amplified pre-existing, pre-Christian Armenian myths about the mountain being a sacred, inaccessible dwelling place of gods and mythical heroes. This fusion of the biblical narrative with local folklore cemented the mountain's sacred status and paved the way for its central role in Armenian national identity.  

### 2.3 The Cultural and National Nexus: Ararat and Armenian Identity

For the Armenian people, Mount Ararat is far more than a geological feature or a biblical landmark; it is the sacred heart of their national identity. Despite lying entirely outside the borders of the modern Republic of Armenia, it is universally regarded as the country's principal national symbol. It is poetically and mythologically considered the "mother" of the Armenian people and the mythical birthplace of their nation.  

This deep connection was formalized by the 5th-century Armenian historian Movses Khorenats'i. In his foundational work, _History of Armenia_, he explicitly linked the Armenian people to the biblical narrative of the Flood. He traced their lineage to a patriarch named Hayk, a descendant of Noah's son Japheth. According to the legend, Hayk rebelled against the tyrannical Babylonian king Bel (identified with the biblical Nimrod) and defeated him in a great battle at the foot of Mount Ararat, thereby establishing the Armenian nation. This powerful origin myth positions Armenia as the cradle of all post-diluvian civilization and inextricably ties the identity of the Armenian people to the mountain.  

The visual and political representation of this connection is ubiquitous. Mount Ararat, with Noah's Ark resting on its summit, is the central element of the official coat of arms of Armenia, a design used since the first republic in 1918 and readopted after independence in 1992. The mountain's majestic twin peaks are a constant, poignant presence on the horizon from the capital, Yerevan, serving as a daily reminder of a lost historical homeland and the profound national tragedy of the Armenian Genocide, during which the Armenian population of the region was eliminated. It is featured in countless works of Armenian art and literature and gives its name to everything from brandy to political figures, embodying the concept of "historical Armenia" versus the "real Armenia" of today's borders.  

## Section 3: The Modern Quest for Noah's Ark: A History of Exploration and Pseudoscience

The conviction that physical remains of Noah's Ark are preserved on Mount Ararat has inspired more than a century of expeditions, claims, and controversies. This modern quest, however, exists almost entirely outside the bounds of mainstream science and archaeology. It is a field characterized by anecdotal evidence, the promotion of natural formations as man-made artifacts, and media-driven announcements that bypass peer review. This section will critically examine the history of these attempts, provide a detailed case study of the most famous "alternative" site, and articulate the overwhelming scientific consensus that these efforts fall into the category of pseudoarchaeology.

### 3.1 A Chronicle of "Arkeology": From Eyewitnesses to Satellites

The modern search for the Ark began in earnest with the first documented ascents of the mountain. In 1829, Friedrich Parrot reached the summit and noted the firm local Armenian belief that the Ark remained there, divinely protected from human discovery. Decades later, in 1876, the British statesman James Bryce found a four-foot-long piece of worked wood high above the treeline, fueling speculation that it could be a remnant of the vessel.  

The 20th century was dominated by a series of compelling but ultimately uncorroborated eyewitness accounts. The most famous of these came from George Hagopian, an Armenian man who claimed that as a boy around 1908, his uncle had taken him up the mountain to see the Ark, which he described as a long, petrified structure. Another key account came from Ed Davis, a US Army sergeant who claimed to have been shown the Ark in 1943 by a local Kurdish guide in the mountain's treacherous Ahora Gorge. These vivid, and often similar, narratives inspired numerous expeditions by hopeful explorers, including the late Apollo astronaut James Irwin, though none were able to locate the described object.  

The advent of the Cold War and satellite technology introduced a new chapter. The declassification of US spy plane and satellite imagery in the 1990s revealed a feature on the mountain's northwest plateau that became known as the "Ararat Anomaly". This large, elongated, dark shape, partially submerged in glacial ice, was seized upon by Ark-seekers like Honolulu businessman Daniel McGivern as potential proof. Despite repeated analysis, however, the anomaly is widely considered by intelligence and imaging experts to be a natural rock formation, a shadow effect, or a combination of both.  

The 21st century has seen the continuation of this trend, often characterized by high-profile media events rather than scientific publication. Notable efforts include those by Bob Cornuke's Bible Archeology Search and Exploration (BASE) Institute, which, after failing to find evidence on Ararat, shifted its focus to a site in Iran based on a reinterpretation of scripture and the Ed Davis account. The most publicized claim came in 2010 from Noah's Ark Ministries International (NAMI), a Hong Kong-based evangelical group. NAMI held a press conference announcing the discovery of a wooden structure high on the mountain, complete with video footage and wood samples purportedly carbon-dated to 4,800 years BP. The claim was immediately met with widespread skepticism from the scientific and archaeological communities. Critics pointed to the lack of professional archaeologists on the team and the fact that the discovery was announced to the media before being submitted for peer review. The claim was further undermined by allegations of fraud from a former associate, who stated that the "site" was constructed by Kurdish workers using wood brought from an old structure near the Black Sea. These endeavors are almost universally classified by academics as pseudoarchaeology or, more colloquially, "arkeology"—a form of creation science aimed at finding proof for a preconceived belief rather than objectively testing a hypothesis.  

|Site|Location|Primary Proponents/Tradition|Purported Evidence|Scientific/Archaeological Assessment|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Mount Ararat (Ağrı Dağı)**|Eastern Turkey, Ağrı Province|Modern "Arkeology" (e.g., NAMI, McGivern, Irwin); Western Christian tradition since the Middle Ages.|Eyewitness accounts (Hagopian, Davis); "Ararat Anomaly" satellite imagery; NAMI's claimed wooden structure.|Geologically a post-Flood volcano, making it an impossible landing site in a literal biblical timeframe. Claims are unverified, unsubstantiated, or alleged to be fraudulent. The Anomaly is considered a natural feature.|
|**Durupınar Formation**|Mount Tendürek, Ağrı Province, Turkey|Ron Wyatt, David Fasold (initially), Noah's Ark Scans.|Large, boat-shaped geological formation matching biblical dimensions; "anchor stones" (drogues) in a nearby village; disputed metal detector and GPR readings.|Conclusively identified as a natural geologic structure (a doubly plunging syncline) shaped by mudflows.

Some early Christian and Muslim writers claimed remains were visible in antiquity.|Considered the most plausible regional location according to the oldest historical and textual traditions. However, no credible physical or archaeological evidence of the Ark has ever been found on the mountain.|

### 3.2 Case Study in Pseudoscience: The Durupınar Formation

Perhaps no site better illustrates the methods and pitfalls of "arkeology" than the Durupınar formation. Located on the flank of Mount Tendürek, about 29 km (18 mi) south of the Ararat summit, this site is a large, strikingly boat-shaped geological formation made of limonite. It was first brought to international attention in the mid-20th century and was heavily promoted in the 1980s and 1990s by amateur explorer Ron Wyatt, and for a time by his associate David Fasold. They claimed it was the petrified remains of Noah's Ark.  

The claims were extensive and specific: the formation's length of 164 meters (538 feet) was said to match the biblical 300 cubits; ground-penetrating radar and metal detector surveys (the latter compared to dowsing) supposedly revealed a regular pattern of internal "iron fittings" and "rib timbers"; and large, holed stones found in the nearby village of Kazan were identified as the Ark's "anchor stones," or drogues.  

These claims have been definitively refuted by multiple geological studies. The site is a completely natural formation. Geologists have identified it as a doubly plunging syncline—a specific type of U-shaped folded rock strata. The surrounding terrain is a mudflow, and as this material has slowly slid downhill over millennia, it has flowed around this more resistant rock structure, scouring it into a streamlined, boat-like shape. The scientific analysis of the "evidence" is equally conclusive:  

- The "iron fittings" detected are natural concentrations of iron-rich minerals like limonite and magnetite, which are common in this volcanic region.  
    
- The "fossilized gopherwood" and "rib timbers" are misidentified local rocks, including metamorphosed peridotite and layers of andesite and basalt.  
    
- The "anchor stones" are carved from local andesite (volcanic rock) and could not have been transported from Mesopotamia, where the Ark was supposedly built. They are widely believed to be ancient pagan stelae or cult stones, later inscribed with crosses and repurposed as Christian tombstones.  
    

The history of the Durupınar site perfectly illustrates a repeating lifecycle common to pseudoscientific endeavors. An ambiguous but visually suggestive anomaly is identified. A charismatic proponent then interprets all data through the lens of a preconceived belief, often using non-standard methods and ignoring contradictory evidence. The "findings" are amplified through popular media, bypassing peer review. Mainstream science eventually provides a more parsimonious, evidence-based natural explanation. Despite this definitive refutation—and even co-proponent David Fasold's own public recantation of his belief in the site —the belief persists in a dedicated subculture. Recent claims by new groups, such as Noah's Ark Scans, citing "new" GPR and soil test results, represent the latest iteration of this cycle, restarting the process while failing to address the fundamental geological reality that the structure is natural.  

### 3.3 The Scientific and Scholarly Consensus

Within the mainstream academic communities of archaeology, geology, and biblical studies, the search for Noah's Ark is not considered a valid scientific or historical pursuit. After more than a century of searching, fueled by considerable passion and funding, no credible, verifiable, peer-reviewed evidence for the Ark's remains has ever been produced.  

The lack of direct evidence is compounded by overwhelming contrary evidence from multiple scientific disciplines. As discussed, geology shows that the modern Mount Ararat is a post-Flood volcano. Beyond this, physics, biology, and engineering demonstrate the practical impossibilities of a global flood as described in a literal reading of Genesis, including the challenges of housing and caring for all animal species, and the structural unviability of a wooden vessel of the Ark's immense size built with ancient technology.  

The modern quest for the Ark is not a neutral scientific activity but an arena where profoundly different worldviews and identities collide. For many Western Ark-hunters, the mountain is primarily a potential source of physical proof for a literalist interpretation of the Bible; their quest is theological and ideological. For the Turkish government, the mountain is a national landmark and a sensitive border region, making expedition permits a tool of state control. For the Armenian people, the mountain is a sacred symbol of their national origin and lost homeland, and the search by outsiders can be seen as an appropriation of this deep cultural touchstone. For the scientific community, the mountain is a valuable site for studying geology, glaciology, and legitimate archaeology (of the Urartian kingdom), and the Ark search is often viewed as a distraction that promotes pseudoscience. These competing claims make Mount Ararat a contested landscape, where every "discovery" is immediately filtered through these divergent lenses.  

## Section 4: Synthesis and Geopolitical Conclusion

The task of geolocating the "mountains of Ararat" from Genesis 8:4 requires navigating a complex landscape of textual analysis, ancient history, modern geography, national mythology, and pseudoscience. A definitive answer cannot be a single point on a map but must be a multi-layered conclusion that acknowledges the different meanings the name "Ararat" has held over time. By synthesizing the evidence from the preceding sections, it is possible to provide a clear, academically sound geolocation for the biblical reference while also contextualizing the modern traditions and controversies that surround it.

### 4.1 Delineating the Three "Ararats"

The comprehensive analysis presented in this report demonstrates that the name "Ararat" must be understood in three distinct, though historically linked, ways:

1. **The Biblical-Historical Ararat:** This is the original referent of Genesis 8:4. It denotes the vast, mountainous territory of the Iron Age **Kingdom of Urartu**, a major political and geographical entity centered on the Armenian Highlands around Lake Van. This is the location as understood within its primary historical context.
    
2. **The Traditional-Cultural Ararat:** This refers to the singular, iconic volcanic peak of **Mount Ararat (Ağrı Dağı)**. This specific mountain became the focus of the biblical tradition through a later historical process, driven by the power of its visual symbolism and its fusion with Armenian national mythology. It is the Ararat of tradition and cultural identity.
    
3. **The Mythical-Modern Ararat:** This is the conceptual location at the heart of modern pseudoarchaeological quests. It is an "X" on a map for believers seeking physical validation for a theological narrative. This Ararat exists more in the realm of ideology and popular media than in verifiable history or science.
    

### 4.2 Final Geolocation of the Biblical "Mountains of Ararat"

Based on the exhaustive textual, linguistic, historical, and archaeological evidence, the "mountains of Ararat" as mentioned in Genesis 8:4 are most accurately geolocated as **the highlands of the ancient Kingdom of Urartu**.

More specifically, this refers to the mountainous territory of the Armenian Highlands, particularly the ranges located south of Lake Van and north of the heartland of ancient Assyria (modern-day northern Iraq). This area encompasses parts of the **Taurus and Zagros mountain systems**. Within this region, the most plausible candidate for the landing site, according to the oldest extra-biblical traditions (Syriac, Quranic, and Aramaic), is the range known in antiquity as the mountains of Corduene, which contains **Mount Judi (Cudi Dağı)** in the modern Turkish province of Şırnak.  

The modern peak of Mount Ararat (Ağrı Dağı), while located within the broader geographical zone of the ancient kingdom that shared its name, must be definitively **excluded** as the literal landing site of the Ark. The geological evidence that it is a post-Flood volcano makes its candidacy, from a scientific and historical-critical perspective, untenable.  

### 4.3 Conclusion: A Location in History, Tradition, and Myth

In conclusion, the query "geolocate the mountains of Ararat" has no single, simple answer because the name itself has migrated through history, geography, and culture. The biblical text points to a real, identifiable Iron Age kingdom in the highlands of what is now eastern Turkey. Centuries of tradition, driven by the compelling power of visual iconography and the currents of national mythology, transferred that location to a single, sacred peak. Finally, modern popular culture, fueled by religious apologetics and pseudoscience, has transformed that peak into the destination of a perpetual, evidence-resistant quest. A truly exhaustive and expert-level answer requires acknowledging all three layers—the historical region, the traditional peak, and the mythical quest—as distinct but interconnected parts of the long and fascinating story of Ararat. The original location lies in the historical geography of Urartu; its modern location lies at the complex intersection of faith, science, and national identity.
