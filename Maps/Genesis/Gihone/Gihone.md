# The Geolocation of Gihon: An Exhaustive Analysis of the Edenic River and the Jerusalem Spring

## Introduction

The name "Gihon" presents a singular challenge to students of biblical geography and history, embodying a duality that spans the chasm between mythic primordial time and documented historical reality. In the Old Testament, the name designates two distinct and seemingly irreconcilable entities. The first is the Gihon of Genesis 2, one of four great rivers flowing from a single source in the Garden of Eden, a cosmological artery watering a distant, enigmatic land. The second is the Gihon of Jerusalem, a tangible, archaeologically attested spring in the Kidron Valley, a vital water source whose control was central to the city's survival, royal coronations, and military defense. This report seeks to resolve this fundamental ambiguity through a multi-disciplinary investigation. It will deconstruct this duality by providing a comprehensive analysis of the textual, geographical, archaeological, and theological evidence for both entities. The investigation will begin with the mysterious river of Eden, exploring the intense scholarly debate surrounding its location, a debate that hinges on the identification of the "land of Cush." It will then turn to the historical Gihon Spring, examining its geological nature and its pivotal role in the narratives of King Solomon's anointing and King Hezekiah's preparations for war. Finally, the report will delve into the remarkable archaeological discoveries of the Gihon's associated water systems—from the Bronze Age Warren's Shaft to the Iron Age masterpiece of Hezekiah's Tunnel and its terminus at the Pool of Siloam. Throughout this analysis, the etymological meaning of Gihon, from the Hebrew

_giha_ ("to gush forth"), will serve as a foundational thematic link, connecting the powerful, life-giving river of paradise with the intermittent, gushing spring that was the lifeblood of ancient Jerusalem. The ultimate objective is to synthesize these two identities, demonstrating how a name rooted in the ideal geography of creation was deliberately applied to a physical place, thereby framing Jerusalem as a terrestrial echo of the divine garden.

## Part I: The Gihon of Eden (Genesis 2:13) – A River of Myth and Mystery

### Textual and Cosmological Framework

The investigation into the Edenic Gihon begins with a close reading of the foundational text in [[2|Genesis 2:10-14]]. The passage describes a unique hydrological system originating from a single, sacred source: "A river flowed out of Eden to water the garden, and from there it separated and became four heads". These four "heads" or rivers are named as the Pishon, the Gihon, the Hiddekel, and the Perat. The latter two are almost unanimously identified by scholars as the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, respectively. This identification provides a crucial geographical anchor, situating the narrative's landscape, at least in part, within Mesopotamia. The description of a single source river that divides into four is significant. It presents a complete, world-defining water system that flows from a divine center outwards, a common motif in Ancient Near Eastern cosmology where a central, sacred source of water symbolizes divine order, fertility, and life-giving power. This suggests that the author's purpose may have been as much theological and cosmological as it was cartographical, portraying Eden as the font from which all life-sustaining waters emanate to the corners of the known world.

### The "Land of Cush" Conundrum: The Critical Variable

The primary obstacle to geolocating the Gihon River is the identification of the territory it is said to encircle: "the whole land of Cush" (כּוּשׁ). The resolution of this geographical reference is the prerequisite for any coherent theory, and the ambiguity surrounding it has produced two major, competing hypotheses.

#### The African Hypothesis

The traditional and most common identification of Cush is with the region south of Egypt, corresponding to ancient Nubia and the Kingdom of Kush, an area encompassing modern-day southern Egypt, Sudan, and northern Ethiopia. This interpretation is supported by the consistent use of the term "Cush" throughout the rest of the Old Testament to refer to this African nation. This identification has ancient roots; the first-century historian Josephus, the third-century BCE Jewish translators of the Greek Septuagint, and the author of the Book of Jubilees all equated the Gihon with the Nile. Ethiopian tradition has long and powerfully identified its own great river, the Abay (Blue Nile), which encircles the former kingdom of Gojjam, as the biblical Gihon (or Giyon). This tradition found expression in European cartography, as seen in the 1459 Fra Mauro map, which explicitly labels the Nile as "Gion".

The principal challenge to this hypothesis is the immense geographical disparity. The Tigris and Euphrates rivers are located in Mesopotamia, thousands of kilometers from the Nile. A shared terrestrial source for these rivers is impossible under current geological conditions, a fact that has led to a range of speculative theories to reconcile the text with geography. Some propose that the text reflects a pre-Flood topography that was radically altered by the cataclysm. Others have suggested vast, subterranean river systems that connect the continents, allowing the river from Eden to sink into the ground and reemerge in four distinct locations. While creative, these solutions lack geological evidence and highlight the core difficulty of a literal African identification.

#### The Asiatic Hypothesis

The geographical challenges of the African hypothesis have led many scholars to propose that the "Cush" of Genesis 2 refers to a location in Asia, closer to the Tigris and Euphrates. A leading theory, advanced by scholars such as Juris Zarins, identifies Cush with the land of the Kassites. The Kassites (Akkadian

_Kaššu_, pronounced _Kushshu_ in Nuzi documents) were a people who inhabited the Zagros Mountains in modern-day Iran, east of Mesopotamia. This interpretation has the significant advantage of placing all four rivers within a plausible geographical region. This view finds ancillary support in the writings of the Greek historian Herodotus, who mentioned the existence of both an African and an Asiatic "Ethiopia" (the Greek term for Cush).

Other Asiatic theories have been proposed. Some nineteenth-century and modern scholars have sought to connect the land of Cush with the Hindu Kush mountain range and, consequently, the Gihon with the Amu Darya (or Oxus River). This river was known to medieval Islamic writers as the Jayhun or Jihon, a name derived from the biblical Gihon. Further support for an Asiatic location comes from the "Table of Nations" in Genesis 10, where the descendants of Cush, such as Nimrod, are associated with the founding of cities in Mesopotamia (Babel, Erech, Akkad) and Arabia (Havilah, Sebah).

The very existence of these two strong, well-supported, yet mutually exclusive geographical arguments points toward a deeper textual reality. The scholarly quest for a single, "correct" location for Cush may be an attempt to impose modern cartographic precision onto an ancient text whose primary aims were theological and cosmological. In the Ancient Near Eastern worldview, Cush (Ethiopia) often symbolized the most distant, exotic edge of the known world. It is therefore plausible that the author's use of "Cush" was not intended as a precise pin on a map, but as a literary device. By describing a river flowing from the divine center of Eden to the land of Cush, the text conveys the universal, world-encompassing nature of the life-giving waters that emanate from God's presence. The geographical "conundrum" of Cush, therefore, may be a deliberate feature of the text, not a flaw, designed to illustrate that the blessings of Eden reach the very ends of the earth.

### Major Geographical Theories for the Edenic Gihon

Based on the divergent interpretations of "Cush," several specific rivers have been proposed as candidates for the Gihon.

- **The Nile Theory:** This theory identifies Gihon with the Blue Nile or the combined Nile River system. It aligns perfectly with the African identification of Cush and is supported by ancient traditions, but it struggles to overcome the geographical problem of connecting the Nile to the Mesopotamian rivers.
    
- **Mesopotamian Theories:** These theories propose rivers in or near Mesopotamia, consistent with an Asiatic Cush. The **Karun River**, which flows from the Zagros Mountains of Iran (the historical land of the Kassites) and joins the Shatt al-Arab waterway formed by the confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates, is a particularly strong candidate. Another proposed river is the
    
    **Kerkha**, which also originates in the Zagros and flows through the ancient Kassite region. These theories offer the most geographically coherent picture of the four rivers.
    
- **Northern Theories:** These theories look to the north of Mesopotamia. The **Araxes River** (modern Aras), which flows through Turkey, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Iran before emptying into the Caspian Sea, has been suggested by several scholars. Another northern candidate is the
    
    **Oxus River** (Amu Darya) in Central Asia, an identification linked to the association of Cush with the Hindu Kush mountains.
    

The following table provides a comparative analysis of these leading theories.

**Table 1: Comparative Analysis of Edenic Gihon Theories**

| **Amu Darya (Oxus) Theory** | Amu Darya (Oxus River)                  | Hindu Kush                              | 19th-century scholars; Medieval Islamic texts call the river "Jayhun" or "Jihon".     | Requires a significant northward shift of the Edenic geography; less direct textual support.       |
| **Araxes River Theory**     | Araxes (Aras) River                     | Asiatic Cush (unspecified) or Chusistan | Early modern scholars (Calumet, Rosenmuller); general northern Mesopotamian location. | Lacks a specific, compelling identification for the associated "land of Cush."                     |

### The Symbolic and Mythic Interpretation

An alternative to a strictly geographical reading is the symbolic interpretation, which posits that the description of Eden and its rivers is primarily theological and cosmological rather than topographical. In this view, the river flowing from Eden and splitting into four represents the outflow of God's life-giving grace, sustenance, and blessing to the four corners of the world, a concept reinforced by the mention of precious materials like gold, bdellium, and onyx found in the lands watered by these rivers. The number four itself often symbolizes completeness or the entire world in biblical thought. This interpretation does not necessarily negate a potential historical or geographical memory underlying the narrative. However, it prioritizes the literary and theological function of the text, suggesting that the modern scholarly obsession with precise geolocation may be a futile exercise that misses the author's primary intent: to depict the divine garden as the ultimate source of all abundance and life for the entire earth.

## Part II: The Gihon of Jerusalem – A Spring of History and Power

### The Gihon Spring: Jerusalem's Lifeblood

In stark contrast to the mythic river of Eden, the second Gihon of the Old Testament is a specific, physical, and historically crucial landmark: the Gihon Spring. Located in the Kidron Valley, just east of the ancient ridge known as the City of David or Ophel, this spring was the sole reliable water source that made sustained human settlement in Jerusalem possible. Geologically, it is an intermittent karst spring, a type that is fed by an underground reservoir that periodically fills and then empties through a siphon-like passage. This action produces a characteristic "gushing" or "bursting forth" of water, a feature from which its Hebrew name,

_Gihon_, is derived. Before modern overpumping lowered the water table, the spring would gush several times a day, its frequency varying with the seasons. This intermittent flow made the construction of reservoirs, such as the Pool of Siloam, essential for storing water for the city's needs. Over the centuries, the spring has been known by other names, including the "Fountain of the Virgin" and "Saint Mary's Pool," and has been attributed with mystical and healing properties, a sacredness that likely dates back to its earliest use.

### The Gihon in Royal Ideology: The Anointing of Solomon

The Gihon Spring transitions from a mere geographical feature to a site of profound political and religious significance in the narrative of King Solomon's accession, detailed in 1 Kings 1:33-45. As the aged King David lies dying, his son Adonijah attempts to seize the throne, gathering his supporters for a coronation feast at En-rogel, another spring south of the city. Alerted to the conspiracy, David acts decisively, commanding his loyalists—Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the captain of the guard—to stage a public and official counter-proclamation. He instructs them: "Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gihon".

This act was a masterstroke of political theater. By using the royal guard (the Cherethites and Pelethites) and having Solomon ride the king's personal mule, David signaled an undeniable and official transfer of power. The choice of location was equally critical. The anointing ceremony at Gihon was not merely a tactical move to a different venue; it was a deeply symbolic act. The conflict between Adonijah and Solomon becomes mirrored in the sacred geography of Jerusalem. Adonijah chose a peripheral, though significant, site for his self-proclamation. David, in response, re-centered the locus of legitimate power at the Gihon, the city's very source of life. This choice symbolically linked the endurance and vitality of Solomon's reign to the perpetual, life-sustaining flow of the spring. The anointing at Gihon declared that Solomon's kingship was not a mere political power grab but was as essential and divinely ordained for Jerusalem's survival as the water itself. From this moment, Gihon was established as a site of royal legitimization, a place where earthly kingship was consecrated at the city's sacred heart-spring.

### The Gihon in Warfare: The Siege of Sennacherib

Two and a half centuries after Solomon, the Gihon Spring once again took center stage, this time in a context of military strategy. In the late 8th century BCE, King Hezekiah of Judah led a rebellion against the dominant Assyrian Empire, prompting a punitive invasion by the formidable King Sennacherib in 701 BCE. The biblical accounts in 2 Kings 20:20 and 2 Chronicles 32:2-4, 30 describe Hezekiah's extensive preparations for the impending siege of Jerusalem. Foremost among these measures was a brilliant feat of hydraulic engineering. Hezekiah "took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which were without the city," and "stopped the upper watercourse of Gihon, and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David".

The military logic was twofold and demonstrated immense foresight. First, by stopping up the spring's external outlet, Hezekiah denied the besieging Assyrian army access to an abundant and reliable source of fresh water, a critical logistical challenge for any large army. Second, by diverting the water through a newly constructed tunnel into a reservoir within the city's fortifications, he secured that same water supply for his own people, ensuring they could withstand a prolonged siege. This strategic manipulation of the Gihon's flow transformed Jerusalem's greatest vulnerability—a water source outside its main walls—into a powerful defensive asset.

## Part III: The Archaeology of the Gihon Water Systems

The biblical narratives concerning the Gihon Spring are substantiated and enriched by extensive archaeological evidence. Excavations have revealed a series of complex and sophisticated water systems, constructed over more than a millennium, designed to harness, control, and protect this vital resource.

### The Pre-Israelite and Early Israelite Systems (Bronze & Early Iron Ages)

Long before Hezekiah, the inhabitants of Jerusalem recognized the strategic importance of the Gihon Spring and engineered remarkable systems to manage its water.

- **The Siloam Channel (c. 1800 BCE):** Dating to the Middle Bronze Age, this is one of the earliest known waterworks. It was a channel or aqueduct, cut about 6 meters (20 feet) into the ground and covered with stone slabs, which were then concealed. It ran southwards from the spring along the lower eastern slope of the City of David, likely serving to irrigate the agricultural terraces in the Kidron Valley, an area later known as the "King's Garden".
    
- **The "Warren's Shaft" System (c. 1800 BCE, modified later):** This is a more complex system designed for defensive purposes. It allowed residents to access the spring's water from within the city walls, a crucial advantage during a siege. The system consists of a fortified entrance, a long, steeply stepped tunnel leading down through the rock, and a vertical shaft at its end, dropping to the water level. Modern research has revealed that the system ingeniously incorporated natural karstic fissures in the limestone bedrock. Furthermore, excavations in the 1990s uncovered two massive Canaanite-era towers that protected the spring and an adjacent rock-cut pool, demonstrating the high priority given to securing the water source from the earliest periods of the city's history. The system is named for its 19th-century discoverer, Charles Warren, and some have speculated that it may be the
    
    _tsinnor_ (pipe or shaft) through which David's forces captured the city of Jebus, as mentioned in 2 Samuel 5:8, though this identification remains debated by scholars.
    

### The Masterwork of the Iron Age: Hezekiah's Tunnel

The most famous of the Gihon's waterworks is the tunnel attributed to King Hezekiah. It remains a stunning testament to the engineering capabilities of the Iron Age.

#### Construction and Engineering

The tunnel is a 533-meter (1,750-foot) long conduit carved through solid limestone bedrock. Its most remarkable feature is that it was excavated by two teams working simultaneously from opposite ends—one starting at the Gihon Spring and the other at the intended site of the Siloam Pool—who successfully met in the middle. The engineering precision is breathtaking: over its entire length, the tunnel has a gradient of only 0.06 percent, with a total drop in elevation of just 30 centimeters (about 12 inches), enough to ensure a gentle, steady flow of water. The tunnel follows a winding, S-shaped course, which has puzzled scholars. Theories to explain this circuitous route, which is 40% longer than a straight line, include the suggestion that the diggers were following a natural, soft karstic fissure in the rock to ease their work, or that they used acoustic sounding (listening for the sounds of hammering from the other team) to guide their path. Recent research has also uncovered evidence for another ingenious feature: a sluice gate located about 71 meters from the southern exit. The discovery of iron bolts, petrified wood, and a shaft to the surface suggests the existence of a movable wooden gate that could control the water level and flow, a sophisticated innovation that would be the oldest of its kind ever found.

#### The Siloam Inscription

In 1880, a paleo-Hebrew inscription was discovered carved into the tunnel's wall near its southern end. Now housed in the Istanbul Archaeology Museum, the Siloam Inscription provides a dramatic, first-hand account of the project's completion. The text reads:

> _" the excavation! Now this is the history of the breaking through. While the workmen were still lifting up the pickaxe, each toward his neighbor, and while three cubits yet remained to be cut through, the voice of the other was heard calling to his neighbor, for there was an excess in the rock on the right. And on the day of the breaking through, the excavators struck, each to meet the other, pickaxe against pickaxe; and there flowed the water from the spring to the pool over a space of one thousand and two hundred cubits. And a hundred cubits was the height of the rock above the heads of the excavators."_

The narrative of this inscription provides a unique window into the human experience of this monumental undertaking. Royal inscriptions in the Ancient Near East are overwhelmingly focused on glorifying the king, attributing all great works to his might and piety. The biblical accounts, in this vein, credit King Hezekiah for the tunnel. The Siloam Inscription, however, is strikingly different. It makes no mention of the king or any deity. Its focus is entirely on the human drama of the workers—the tension, the sound of voices through the rock, the excitement of the "breakthrough," and the professional pride in the technical details. This is not a royal monument but an engineer's or foreman's report. It represents a rare "bottom-up" historical record that preserves the voice and pride of the skilled laborers who executed the project, a powerful counter-narrative to the official "top-down" history recorded elsewhere.

#### The Dating Debate

While traditionally attributed to Hezekiah's preparations for the 701 BCE siege, the tunnel's construction date has become a subject of intense scholarly debate. The following table summarizes the main arguments.

**Table 2: Chronological Debate of Hezekiah's Tunnel Construction**

|Proposed Date / Period|Key Scholarly Proponents|Primary Evidence Cited|Historical Implications of Dating|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Reign of Hezekiah (c. 701 BCE)**|Traditional View / Majority of Scholars|Biblical accounts (2 Kings 20, 2 Chron. 32); Paleography of Siloam Inscription; Radiocarbon dating of plaster|An emergency project executed with great haste in direct response to the imminent Assyrian siege.|
|**Pre-Hezekiah (late 9th / early 8th c. BCE)**|Ronny Reich & Eli Shukron|Stratigraphic evidence of a house built over a blocked channel connected to the tunnel system; Pottery dating|Part of a longer-term urban development plan by one of Hezekiah's predecessors, not a rushed emergency measure.|
|**Post-Hezekiah (Reign of Manasseh, 7th c. BCE)**|Ernst Axel Knauf|Argument that Hezekiah would not have had sufficient time to complete such a massive project before the siege|A post-siege reconstruction or improvement project undertaken when time was not a critical factor.|

### The Terminus: The Pool of Siloam

The water diverted through the Gihon's tunnels emptied into a reservoir at the southern end of the City of David, known as the Pool of Siloam. Archaeology has revealed several phases of this crucial installation.

- **First Temple Period Pool:** The original reservoir constructed by Hezekiah was designed to capture the water flowing from his new tunnel, enclosing it within a newly expanded city wall. The exact dimensions and features of this Iron Age pool are a subject of ongoing excavation.
    
- **Second Temple Period Pool:** In 2004, a remarkable discovery was made during sewer work: a monumental, trapezoidal, stepped pool dating to the first century CE. This grand structure, some 69 meters (225 feet) long, served a dual purpose. It was a vital water reservoir for the lower city, but its broad steps indicate it also functioned as a large public
    
    _mikveh_, or ritual purification bath. Pilgrims would immerse themselves here before ascending the newly excavated Pilgrimage Road to the Temple Mount. This is the pool mentioned in the New Testament, in the Gospel of John's account of Jesus healing a man born blind (John 9:1-11).
    
- **Byzantine Pool:** For centuries, Christian pilgrims identified a smaller, nearby pool as the site of the biblical miracle. This pool was constructed in the 5th century CE by the Byzantine Empress Eudocia to commemorate the event. The 2004 discovery of the much larger Second Temple pool corrected this long-held tradition, revealing the true location of the pool from the time of Jesus.
    

## Conclusion: Synthesizing the Two Gihons – From Edenic Ideal to Earthly Reality

This exhaustive analysis reveals two distinct and separate identities for the name Gihon in the Old Testament. The first Gihon is a great, semi-mythic river of paradise, its precise location lost to time and subject to intense, unresolved scholarly debate. The second Gihon is a physical, historically rich, and archaeologically verified spring in Jerusalem, the very lifeblood of the ancient city. A direct geographical link between the two is impossible. The connection is, therefore, primarily linguistic and, more importantly, theological.

The shared name, derived from the Hebrew for "gushing forth," serves as the conceptual bridge. The naming of the Jerusalem spring was almost certainly a deliberate act of theological place-making. By bestowing upon their city's life-source the same name as one of the four rivers of Eden, the inhabitants of Jerusalem symbolically framed their city as a new Eden, a terrestrial center of divine presence and life-giving power. This powerful symbolism resonates through other biblical texts that envision a river flowing from the sacred heart of Jerusalem, such as Psalm 46:4 ("There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God") and the eschatological visions of a river of life flowing from the Temple in Ezekiel 47 and Revelation 22.

Within this framework, the historical events at the Jerusalem Gihon acquire deeper meaning. The anointing of Solomon at the spring is not just a political maneuver; it is the consecration of a king for this new Eden, a ruler whose peaceful reign is meant to "gush forth" with wisdom and prosperity. Hezekiah's engineering works are not just a military tactic; they are the actions of a king protecting the sacred life-source of God's chosen city. Ultimately, the geolocation of Gihon is a dual task. One path leads to the speculative and symbolic geography of the ancient world's creation myths. The other leads to the bedrock of Jerusalem and the tangible evidence of its long history. Both paths, however, converge on a single, powerful theological idea: the enduring human quest to find and sanctify a place on earth that reflects the divine, life-giving ideal of paradise.
