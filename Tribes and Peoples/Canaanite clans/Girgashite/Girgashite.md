[[10|Genesis 10:16]]

**Summary:** The **Girgashites** are one of the most enigmatic of the Canaanite tribes. They are consistently listed among the seven nations inhabiting Canaan that the Israelites were to displace, but very little specific information is given about them in the Bible or in other historical records.

**Location:** **Unknown**, but generally believed to have lived within **central Canaan**, possibly west of the Sea of Galilee.
