<sup>1</sup> “When a man takes a wife and shall marry her, then it shall be, if she finds no favour in his eyes because he has found a matter of uncoveredness in her, and he shall write her a certificate of divorce, and put it in her hand, and send her out of his house,
<sup>2</sup> and if she left his house and went and became another man’s wife,
<sup>3</sup> and the latter husband shall hate her and write her a certificate of divorce, and put it in her hand, and send her out of his house, or when the latter husband dies who took her to be his wife,
<sup>4</sup> then her former husband who sent her away is not allowed to take her back to be his wife after she has been defiled, for that would be an abomination before יהוה. And do not bring sin on the land which יהוה your Elohim is giving you as an inheritance.
<sup>5</sup> “When a man has taken a new wife, let him not go out into the army nor let any matter be imposed upon him. He shall be exempt one year for the sake of his home, to rejoice with his wife whom he has taken.
<sup>6</sup> “No one takes in pledge the lower or the upper millstone, for he would be taking a life in pledge.
<sup>7</sup> “When a man is found kidnapping any of his brothers of the children of Yisra’ĕl, and treats him harshly or sells him, then that kidnapper shall die. Thus you shall purge the evil from your midst.
<sup>8</sup> “Take heed, in an outbreak of leprosy, to diligently guard and do according to all that the priests, the Lĕwites, teach you. As I have commanded them, so you shall guard to do.
<sup>9</sup> “Remember what יהוה your Elohim did to Miryam on the way when you came out of Mitsrayim.
<sup>10</sup> “When you lend your brother a loan, do not go into his house to get his pledge.
<sup>11</sup> “Stand outside, and let the man to whom you lend bring the pledge out to you.
<sup>12</sup> “And if the man is poor, do not sleep with his pledge.
<sup>13</sup> “By all means return the pledge to him at sundown, and he shall sleep in his own garment, and shall bless you. And it shall be righteousness to you before יהוה your Elohim.
<sup>14</sup> “Do not oppress a hired servant who is poor and needy, of your brothers or of the strangers who is in your land within your gates.
<sup>15</sup> “Give him his wages on the same day, and do not let the sun go down on it, for he is poor and lifts up his being to it, so that he does not cry out against you to יהוה, and it shall be sin in you.
<sup>16</sup> “Fathers are not put to death for their children, and children are not put to death for their fathers, each is to die for his own sin.
<sup>17</sup> “Do not twist the right-ruling of a stranger or the fatherless, nor take the garment of a widow.
<sup>18</sup> “But you shall remember that you were a slave in Mitsrayim, and that יהוה your Elohim redeemed you from there. Therefore I am commanding you to do this word.
<sup>19</sup> “When you reap your harvest in your field, and have forgotten a sheaf in the field, do not go back to get it. Let it be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow, so that יהוה your Elohim might bless you in all the work of your hands.
<sup>20</sup> “When you beat your olive trees, do not examine the branch behind you. Let it be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow.
<sup>21</sup> “When you gather the grapes of your vineyard, do not glean behind you. Let it be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow.
<sup>22</sup> “And you shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Mitsrayim. Therefore I am commanding you to do this word.
