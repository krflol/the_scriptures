<sup>1</sup> “Then we turned and went up the way to Bashan. And Oḡ sovereign of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Eḏre‛i.
<sup>2</sup> “And יהוה said to me, ‘Do not fear him, for I have given him and all his people and his land into your hand. And you shall do to him as you did to Siḥon sovereign of the Amorites, who dwelt at Ḥeshbon.’
<sup>3</sup> “So יהוה our Elohim also gave into our hands Oḡ sovereign of Bashan, with all his people, and we smote him until he had no survivors remaining.
<sup>4</sup> “And we captured all his cities at that time. There was not a city which we did not take from them: sixty cities, all the district of Argoḇ, the reign of Oḡ in Bashan.
<sup>5</sup> “All these cities were fenced with high walls, gates and bars, besides a great many unwalled towns.
<sup>6</sup> “And we put them under the ban, as we did to Siḥon sovereign of Ḥeshbon, putting the men, the women, and the children of every city under the ban.
<sup>7</sup> “But all the livestock and the spoil of the cities we took as booty for ourselves.
<sup>8</sup> “And at that time we took the land, from the hand of the two sovereigns of the Amorites, that was beyond the Yardĕn, from the wadi Arnon to Mount Ḥermon
<sup>9</sup> “(Tsiḏonians call Ḥermon, Siryon – and the Amorites call it Senir),
<sup>10</sup> all the cities of the plain, all Gil‛aḏ, and all Bashan, as far as Salḵah and Eḏre‛i, cities of the reign of Oḡ in Bashan.
<sup>11</sup> “For only Oḡ sovereign of Bashan was left of the remnant of the Repha’ites. See, his bedstead was an iron bedstead. Is it not in Rabbah of the children of Ammon? Nine cubits is its length and four cubits its width, according to the cubit of a man.
<sup>12</sup> “And this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aro‛ĕr, which is by the wadi Arnon, and half the mountains of Gil‛aḏ and its cities, I gave to the Re’uḇĕnites and the Gaḏites.
<sup>13</sup> “And the rest of Gil‛aḏ, and all Bashan, the reign of Oḡ, I gave to half the tribe of Menashsheh – all the district of Argoḇ, with all Bashan, called the land of the Repha’ites.
<sup>14</sup> “Ya‛ir son of Menashsheh had taken all the district of Argoḇ, as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Ma‛aḵathites, and called them after his own name: the Bashan of Hawoth Ya‛ir, to this day.
<sup>15</sup> “And to Maḵir I gave Gil‛aḏ.
<sup>16</sup> “And to the Re’uḇĕnites and the Gaḏites I gave from Gil‛aḏ as far as the wadi Arnon, the middle of the wadi as the border, as far as the wadi Yabboq, the border of the children of Ammon,
<sup>17</sup> and the desert plain, with the Yardĕn as the border, from Kinnereth as far as the Sea of the Araḇah, the Salt Sea, below the slopes of Pisgah on the east.
<sup>18</sup> “And I commanded you at that time, saying, ‘ יהוה your Elohim has given you this land to possess. All you sons of might, pass over armed before your brothers, the children of Yisra’ĕl.
<sup>19</sup> ‘But let your wives and your little ones, and your livestock – I know that you have much livestock – stay in your cities which I have given you,
<sup>20</sup> until יהוה has given rest to your brothers as to you, and they also possess the land which יהוה your Elohim is giving them beyond the Yardĕn. Then you shall return, each man to his possession which I have given you.’
<sup>21</sup> “And I commanded Yehoshua at that time, saying, ‘Your eyes have seen all that יהוה your Elohim has done to these two sovereigns. יהוה does the same to all the reigns which you are passing over.
<sup>22</sup> ‘Do not fear them, for יהוה your Elohim Himself fights for you.’
<sup>23</sup> “And I pleaded with יהוה at that time, saying,
<sup>24</sup> ‘O Master יהוה, You have begun to show Your servant Your greatness and Your strong hand, for who is a mighty one in the heavens or on earth who does according to Your works and according to Your might?
<sup>25</sup> ‘I pray, let me pass over and see the good land beyond the Yardĕn, this good hill country, and Leḇanon.’
<sup>26</sup> “But יהוה was enraged with me, for your sake, and would not listen to me, and יהוה said to me, ‘Enough of that! Speak no more to Me about this matter.
<sup>27</sup> ‘Go up to the top of Pisgah, and lift up your eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and look with your eyes, for you do not pass over this Yardĕn.
<sup>28</sup> ‘But charge Yehoshua, and strengthen him and make him brave, for he shall pass over before this people and causes them to inherit the land which you see.’
<sup>29</sup> “And we dwelt in the valley opposite Bĕyth Pe‛or.
