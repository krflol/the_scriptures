<sup>1</sup> And Mosheh went up from the desert plains of Mo’aḇ to Mount Neḇo, to the top of Pisgah, which is opposite Yeriḥo. And יהוה showed him all the land of Gil‛aḏ as far as Dan,
<sup>2</sup> and all Naphtali and the land of Ephrayim and Menashsheh, all the land of Yehuḏah as far as the Western Sea,
<sup>3</sup> and the Negeḇ, and the plain of the Valley of Yeriḥo, the city of palm trees, as far as Tso‛ar.
<sup>4</sup> And יהוה said to him, “This is the land of which I swore to Aḇraham, to Yitsḥaq, and to Ya‛aqoḇ, saying, ‘To your seed I give it.’ I have let you look at it with your eyes, but you do not pass over there.”
<sup>5</sup> And Mosheh the servant of יהוה died there in the land of Mo’aḇ, according to the mouth of יהוה.
<sup>6</sup> And He buried him in a valley in the land of Mo’aḇ, opposite Bĕyth Pe‛or, and no one knows his burial place to this day.
<sup>7</sup> And Mosheh was one hundred and twenty years old when he died. His eyes were not dim nor his freshness gone.
<sup>8</sup> And the children of Yisra’ĕl wept for Mosheh in the desert plains of Mo’aḇ thirty days. And the days of weeping and mourning for Mosheh were completed.
<sup>9</sup> And Yehoshua son of Nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom, for Mosheh had laid his hands on him. And the children of Yisra’ĕl listened to him, and did as יהוה had commanded Mosheh.
<sup>10</sup> And since then no prophet has arisen in Yisra’ĕl like Mosheh, whom יהוה knew face to face,
<sup>11</sup> for all the signs and wonders which יהוה sent him to do in the land of Mitsrayim, before Pharaoh, and before all his servants, and in all his land,
<sup>12</sup> and for all that strong hand and all the great fearsome deeds which Mosheh did before the eyes of all Yisra’ĕl.
