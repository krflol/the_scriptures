<sup>1</sup> These are the words of the covenant which יהוה commanded Mosheh to make with the children of Yisra’ĕl in the land of Mo’aḇ, besides the covenant which He made with them in Ḥorĕḇ.
<sup>2</sup> And Mosheh called all Yisra’ĕl and said to them, “You yourselves saw all that יהוה did before your eyes in the land of Mitsrayim, to Pharaoh and to all his servants and to all his land.
<sup>3</sup> “Your eyes saw the great trials, the signs, and those great wonders.
<sup>4</sup> “But יהוה has not given you a heart to know and eyes to see and ears to hear, till this day.
<sup>5</sup> “And I have led you forty years in the wilderness. Your garments have not worn out on you, and your sandals have not worn out on your feet.
<sup>6</sup> “You ate no bread and drank no wine nor strong drink, so that you might know that I am יהוה your Elohim.
<sup>7</sup> “And when you came to this place, Siḥon sovereign of Ḥeshbon and Oḡ sovereign of Bashan came out against us to battle, and we smote them,
<sup>8</sup> and took their land and gave it as an inheritance to the Re’uḇĕnites, and to the Gaḏites, and to half the tribe of Menashsheh.
<sup>9</sup> “Therefore you shall guard the words of this covenant, and do them, so that you prosper in all that you do.
<sup>10</sup> “All of you are standing today before יהוה your Elohim: your leaders, your tribes, your elders and your officers, all the men of Yisra’ĕl,
<sup>11</sup> your little ones, your wives, and your sojourner who is in the midst of your camp, from the one who cuts your wood to the one who draws your water,
<sup>12</sup> so that you should enter into covenant with יהוה your Elohim, and into His oath, which יהוה your Elohim makes with you today,
<sup>13</sup> in order to establish you today as a people for Himself, and He Himself be your Elohim, as He has spoken to you, and as He has sworn to your fathers, to Aḇraham, to Yitsḥaq, and to Ya‛aqoḇ.
<sup>14</sup> “And not with you alone I am making this covenant and this oath,
<sup>15</sup> but with him who stands here with us today before יהוה our Elohim, as well as with him who is not here with us today.
<sup>16</sup> “For you know how we dwelt in the land of Mitsrayim and how we passed through the nations which you passed through,
<sup>17</sup> and you saw their abominations and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which were with them,
<sup>18</sup> lest there should be among you a man or woman or clan or tribe, whose heart turns away today from יהוה our Elohim, to go and serve the mighty ones of these nations, lest there should be among you a root bearing bitterness or wormwood.
<sup>19</sup> “And it shall be, when he hears the words of this curse, that he should bless himself in his heart, saying, ‘I have peace though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart,’ in order to add drunkenness to thirst.
<sup>20</sup> “ יהוה would not forgive him, but rather, the displeasure of יהוה and His jealousy shall burn against that man, and every curse that is written in this book shall settle on him, and יהוה shall blot out his name from under the heavens.
<sup>21</sup> “And יהוה shall separate him for evil, out of all the tribes of Yisra’ĕl, according to all the curses of the covenant that are written in this Book of the Torah.
<sup>22</sup> “And the generation to come of your children who rise up after you, and the foreigner who comes from a far land, shall say when they see the plagues of that land and the sicknesses which יהוה has sent into it:
<sup>23</sup> ‘All its land is sulphur, salt, and burning; it is not sown, nor does it bear, nor does any grass grow there, like the overthrow of Seḏom and Amorah, Aḏmah and Tseḇoyim, which יהוה overthrew in His displeasure and His wrath.’
<sup>24</sup> “And all nations shall say, ‘Why has יהוה done so to this land? What does the heat of this great displeasure mean?’
<sup>25</sup> “And it shall be said, ‘Because they have forsaken the covenant of יהוה Elohim of their fathers, which He made with them when He brought them out of the land of Mitsrayim.
<sup>26</sup> ‘And they went and served other mighty ones and bowed themselves to them, mighty ones that they did not know and that He had not given to them,
<sup>27</sup> therefore the displeasure of יהוה burned against this land, to bring on it every curse that is written in this book.
<sup>28</sup> ‘And יהוה uprooted them from their land in displeasure, and in wrath, and in great rage, and cast them into another land, as it is today.’
<sup>29</sup> “The secret matters belong to יהוה our Elohim, but what is revealed belongs to us and to our children forever, to do all the Words of this Torah.
