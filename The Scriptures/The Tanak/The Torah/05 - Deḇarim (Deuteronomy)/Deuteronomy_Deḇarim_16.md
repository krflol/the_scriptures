<sup>1</sup> “Guard the month of Aḇiḇ, and perform the Passover to יהוה your Elohim, for in the month of Aḇiḇ יהוה your Elohim brought you out of Mitsrayim by night.

<sup>2</sup> “And you shall slaughter the Passover to יהוה your Elohim, from the flock and the herd, in the place where יהוה chooses to put His Name.

<sup>3</sup> “Eat no leavened bread with it. For seven days you eat unleavened bread with it, bread of affliction, because you came out of the land of Mitsrayim in haste – so that you remember the day in which you came out of the land of Mitsrayim, all the days of your life.

<sup>4</sup> “And no leaven should be seen with you in all your border for seven days, neither should any of the meat which you slaughter in the evening on the first day stay all night until morning.

<sup>5</sup> “You are not allowed to slaughter the Passover within any of your gates which יהוה your Elohim gives you,

<sup>6</sup> but at the place where יהוה your Elohim chooses to make His Name dwell, there you slaughter the Passover in the evening, at the going down of the sun, at the appointed time you came out of Mitsrayim.

<sup>7</sup> “And you shall roast and eat it in the place which יהוה your Elohim chooses, and in the morning you shall turn and go to your tents.

<sup>8</sup> “Six days you eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day there is a closing festival to יהוה your Elohim – you do no work.

<sup>9</sup> “Count seven weeks for yourself. Begin to count seven weeks from the time you begin to put the sickle to the grain.

<sup>10</sup> “And you shall perform the Festival of Weeks to יהוה your Elohim, according to the voluntary offering from your hand, which you give as יהוה your Elohim blesses you.

<sup>11</sup> “And you shall rejoice before יהוה your Elohim, you and your son and your daughter, and your male servant and your female servant, and the Lĕwite who is within your gates, and the stranger and the fatherless and the widow who are in your midst, at the place where יהוה your Elohim chooses to make His Name dwell.

<sup>12</sup> “And you shall remember that you were a slave in Mitsrayim, and you shall guard and do these laws.

<sup>13</sup> “Perform the Festival of Booths for seven days after the ingathering from your threshing-floor and from your winepress,

<sup>14</sup> and you shall rejoice in your festival, you and your son and your daughter, and your male servant and your female servant, and the Lĕwite, and the stranger and the fatherless and the widow who are within your gates.

<sup>15</sup> “For seven days you shall observe a festival to יהוה your Elohim in the place which יהוה chooses, because יהוה your Elohim does bless you in all your increase and in all the work of your hands, and you shall be only rejoicing!

<sup>16</sup> “Three times a year all your males appear before יהוה your Elohim in the place which He chooses: at the Festival of Unleavened Bread, and at the Festival of Weeks, and at the Festival of Booths. And none should appear before יהוה empty-handed,

<sup>17</sup> but each one with the gift of his hand, according to the blessing of יהוה your Elohim which He has given you.

<sup>18</sup> “Appoint judges and officers within all your gates, which יהוה your Elohim is giving you, according to your tribes. And they shall judge the people with righteous right-ruling.

<sup>19</sup> “Do not distort right-ruling. Do not show partiality, nor take a bribe, for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and twists the words of the righteous.

<sup>20</sup> “Follow righteousness, righteousness alone, so that you live and inherit the land which יהוה your Elohim is giving you.

<sup>21</sup> “Do not plant for yourself any tree as an Ashĕrah near the altar of יהוה your Elohim that you make for yourself.

<sup>22</sup> “And do not set up a pillar, which יהוה your Elohim hates.
