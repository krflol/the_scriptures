<sup>1</sup> And Mosheh, with the elders of Yisra’ĕl, commanded the people, saying, “Guard all the commands which I am commanding you today.

<sup>2</sup> “And it shall be, on the day when you pass over the Yardĕn to the land which יהוה your Elohim is giving you, that you shall set up for yourselves large stones, and plaster them with plaster,

<sup>3</sup> and write on them all the Words of this Torah, when you have passed over, so that you go into the land which יהוה your Elohim is giving you, ‘a land flowing with milk and honey,’ as יהוה Elohim of your fathers has spoken to you.

<sup>4</sup> “And it shall be, when you have passed over the Yardĕn, that on Mount Ĕyḇal you set up these stones, which I command you today, and you shall plaster them with plaster,

<sup>5</sup> and build an altar to יהוה your Elohim there, an altar of stones – do not use an iron tool on them.

<sup>6</sup> “Build the altar of יהוה your Elohim with complete stones, and you shall offer burnt offerings on it to יהוה your Elohim,

<sup>7</sup> and shall offer peace offerings, and eat there, and rejoice before יהוה your Elohim.

<sup>8</sup> “And you shall write all the Words of this Torah on the stones – plainly and well.”

<sup>9</sup> And Mosheh and the priests, the Lĕwites, spoke to all Yisra’ĕl, saying, “Be silent and hear, O Yisra’ĕl: This day you have become the people of יהוה your Elohim,

<sup>10</sup> and you shall obey the voice of יהוה your Elohim, and do His commands and His laws which I command you today.”

<sup>11</sup> And Mosheh commanded the people on that day, saying,

<sup>12</sup> “These are to stand on Mount Gerizim to bless the people, when you have passed over the Yardĕn: Shim‛on, and Lĕwi, and Yehuḏah, and Yissasḵar, and Yosĕph, and Binyamin.

<sup>13</sup> “And these are to stand on Mount Ĕyḇal to curse: Re’uḇĕn, Gaḏ, and Ashĕr, and Zeḇulun, Dan, and Naphtali.

<sup>14</sup> “And the Lĕwites shall speak with a loud voice and say to all the men of Yisra’ĕl:

<sup>15</sup> ‘Cursed is the man who makes a carved or moulded image, an abomination to יהוה, the work of the hands of the craftsman, and sets it up in secret.’ And all the people shall answer and say, ‘Amĕn!’

<sup>16</sup> ‘Cursed is he who makes light of his father or his mother.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amĕn!’

<sup>17</sup> ‘Cursed is he who moves his neighbour’s boundary.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amĕn!’

<sup>18</sup> ‘Cursed is he who misleads the blind in the way.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amĕn!’

<sup>19</sup> ‘Cursed is he who twists the right-ruling of the stranger, the fatherless, and widow.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amĕn!’

<sup>20</sup> ‘Cursed is he who lies with his father’s wife, because he has uncovered his father’s bed.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amĕn!’

<sup>21</sup> ‘Cursed is he who lies with any beast.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amĕn!’

<sup>22</sup> ‘Cursed is he who lies with his sister, the daughter of his father or the daughter of his mother.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amĕn!’

<sup>23</sup> ‘Cursed is he who lies with his mother-in-law.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amĕn!’

<sup>24</sup> ‘Cursed is he who smites his neighbour secretly.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amĕn!’

<sup>25</sup> ‘Cursed is he who takes a bribe to slay an innocent being.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amĕn!’

<sup>26</sup> ‘Cursed is he who does not establish the Words of this Torah.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amĕn!’
