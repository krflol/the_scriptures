<sup>1</sup> “And this is the command, the laws and right-rulings which יהוה your Elohim has commanded, to teach you to do in the land which you are passing over to possess,

<sup>2</sup> so that you fear יהוה your Elohim, to guard all His laws and His commands which I command you, you and your son and your grandson, all the days of your life, and that your days be prolonged.

<sup>3</sup> “And you shall hear, O Yisra’ĕl, and shall guard to do, that it might be well with you, and that you increase greatly as יהוה Elohim of your fathers has spoken to you, in a land flowing with milk and honey.

<sup>4</sup> “Hear, O Yisra’ĕl: יהוה our Elohim, יהוה is one!

<sup>5</sup> “And you shall love יהוה your Elohim with all your heart, and with all your being, and with all your might.

<sup>6</sup> “And these Words which I am commanding you today shall be in your heart,

<sup>7</sup> and you shall impress them upon your children, and shall speak of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise up,

<sup>8</sup> and shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes.

<sup>9</sup> “And you shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.

<sup>10</sup> “And it shall be, when יהוה your Elohim brings you into the land of which He swore to your fathers, to Aḇraham, to Yitsḥaq, and to Ya‛aqoḇ, to give you great and good cities which you did not build,

<sup>11</sup> and houses filled with all kinds of goods, which you did not fill, and wells dug which you did not dig, vineyards and olive trees which you did not plant, and you shall eat and be satisfied –

<sup>12</sup> be on guard, lest you forget יהוה who brought you out of the land of Mitsrayim, from the house of bondage.

<sup>13</sup> “Fear יהוה your Elohim and serve Him, and swear by His Name.

<sup>14</sup> “Do not go after other mighty ones, the mighty ones of the peoples who are all around you,

<sup>15</sup> for יהוה your Elohim is a jealous Ĕl in your midst, lest the displeasure of יהוה your Elohim burn against you, then He shall destroy you from the face of the earth.

<sup>16</sup> “Do not try יהוה your Elohim as you tried Him in Massah.

<sup>17</sup> “Diligently guard the commands of יהוה your Elohim, and His witnesses, and His laws which He has commanded you.

<sup>18</sup> “And you shall do what is right and good in the eyes of יהוה, that it might be well with you, and you shall go in and possess the good land of which יהוה swore to your fathers,

<sup>19</sup> to drive out all your enemies from before you, as יהוה has spoken.

<sup>20</sup> “When your son asks you in time to come, saying, ‘What is the meaning of the witnesses, and the laws, and the right-rulings which יהוה our Elohim has commanded you?’

<sup>21</sup> then you shall say to your son, ‘We were slaves of Pharaoh in Mitsrayim, and יהוה brought us out of Mitsrayim with a strong hand,

<sup>22</sup> and יהוה sent signs and wonders, great and grievous, upon Mitsrayim, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his household, before our eyes.

<sup>23</sup> ‘And He brought us out from there, to bring us in, to give us the land of which He swore to our fathers.

<sup>24</sup> ‘And יהוה commanded us to do all these laws, to fear יהוה our Elohim, for our good always, to keep us alive, as it is today.

<sup>25</sup> ‘And it is righteousness for us when we guard to do all this command before יהוה our Elohim, as He has commanded us.’
