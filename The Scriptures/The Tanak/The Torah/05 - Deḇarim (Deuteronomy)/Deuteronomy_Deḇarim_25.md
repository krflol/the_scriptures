<sup>1</sup> “When there is a dispute between men, then they shall come unto judgment, and they shall be judged, and the righteous declared righteous and the wrongdoer declared wrong.

<sup>2</sup> “And it shall be, if the wrongdoer is to be beaten, that the judge shall cause him to lie down and be beaten in his presence with the number of blows according to his wrong.

<sup>3</sup> “Forty blows he gives him but no more, lest he beat him with many more blows than these, and your brother be degraded before your eyes.

<sup>4</sup> “Do not muzzle an ox while it is threshing.

<sup>5</sup> “When brothers dwell together, and one of them has died, and has no son, the widow of the dead man shall not become a stranger’s outside. Her husband’s brother does go in to her, and shall take her as his wife, and perform the duty of a husband’s brother to her.

<sup>6</sup> “And it shall be that the first-born son which she bears does rise up for the name of his dead brother, so that his name is not blotted out of Yisra’ĕl.

<sup>7</sup> “But if the man does not desire to take his brother’s wife, then let his brother’s wife go up to the gate to the elders, and say, ‘My husband’s brother refuses to raise up a name to his brother in Yisra’ĕl, he does not agree to perform the duty of my husband’s brother.’

<sup>8</sup> “The elders of his city shall then call him and speak to him, and he shall stand and say, ‘I have no desire to take her,’

<sup>9</sup> then his brother’s wife shall come to him in the presence of the elders, and remove his sandal from his foot, and shall spit in his face, and answer and say, ‘Thus it is done to the man who does not build up his brother’s house.’

<sup>10</sup> “And in Yisra’ĕl his name shall be called, ‘The house of him who had his sandal removed.’

<sup>11</sup> “When men fight with one another, and the wife of one shall draw near to rescue her husband from the hand of the one attacking him, and shall put out her hand and seize him by the genitals,

<sup>12</sup> then you shall cut off her hand – your eye does not pardon.

<sup>13</sup> “You shall not have in your bag differing weights, a heavy and a light.

<sup>14</sup> “You shall not have in your house differing measures, a large and a small.

<sup>15</sup> “You shall have a perfect and right weight, a perfect and right measure, so that they prolong your days on the soil which יהוה your Elohim is giving you.

<sup>16</sup> “For all who do these, and all who do unrighteously, are an abomination to יהוה your Elohim.

<sup>17</sup> “Remember what Amalĕq did to you on the way as you were coming out of Mitsrayim,

<sup>18</sup> how he met you on the way and attacked your back, all the feeble ones in your rear, when you were tired and weary. And he did not fear Elohim.

<sup>19</sup> “Therefore it shall be, when יהוה your Elohim has given you rest from your enemies all around, in the land which יהוה your Elohim is giving you to possess as an inheritance, that you blot out the remembrance of Amalĕq from under the heavens. Do not forget!
