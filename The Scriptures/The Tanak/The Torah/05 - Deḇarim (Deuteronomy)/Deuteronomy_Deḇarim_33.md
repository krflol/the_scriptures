<sup>1</sup> And this is the blessing with which Mosheh the man of Elohim blessed the children of Yisra’ĕl before his death.

<sup>2</sup> And he said, “ יהוה came from Sinai, and rose from Sĕ‛ir for them. He shone forth from Mount Paran, and came with ten thousands of set-apart ones – at His right hand a law of fire for them.

<sup>3</sup> Indeed, He loves the peoples, all His set-apart ones are in Your hand. And they, they sat down at Your feet, receiving Your Words.

<sup>4</sup> Mosheh commanded us a Torah, an inheritance of the assembly of Ya‛aqoḇ.

<sup>5</sup> And He was Sovereign in Yeshurun, when the heads of the people were gathered, the tribes of Yisra’ĕl.

<sup>6</sup> “Let Re’uḇĕn live, and not die, and let his men be numbered.”

<sup>7</sup> And this of Yehuḏah, and he said, “Hear, יהוה, the voice of Yehuḏah, and bring him to his people. His hands shall fight for him, and You be a help against his enemies.”

<sup>8</sup> And of Lĕwi he said, “Your Tummim and Your Urim belong to Your kind one, whom You tried at Massah, with whom You contended at the waters of Meriḇah,

<sup>9</sup> who said of his father and mother, ‘I have not seen them.’ And he did not acknowledge his brothers, or know his own children, for they have guarded Your Word and watched over Your covenant.

<sup>10</sup> “They teach Your right-rulings to Ya‛aqoḇ, and Your Torah to Yisra’ĕl. They put incense before You, and a complete burnt offering on Your altar.

<sup>11</sup> “O יהוה, bless his strength, and accept the work of his hands. Smite the loins of those who rise against him, and of those who hate him, that they rise no more.”

<sup>12</sup> Of Binyamin he said, “Let the beloved of יהוה dwell in safety by Him, shielding him all the day, as he dwells between His shoulders.”

<sup>13</sup> And of Yosĕph he said, “Blessed of יהוה is his land, with the choicest from the heavens, with the dew, and the deep lying beneath,

<sup>14</sup> with the choice fruits of the sun, with the choice yield of the months,

<sup>15</sup> with the finest of the ancient mountains, with the choicest of the everlasting hills,

<sup>16</sup> with the choicest of the earth and all that fills it, and the good pleasure of Him who dwelt in the bush. Let it come on the head of Yosĕph, and on the crown of the head of him who was separate from his brothers.

<sup>17</sup> “His splendour is like a first-born bull, and his horns are like the horns of the wild ox. With them he pushes the peoples to the ends of the earth. And they are the ten thousands of Ephrayim, and they are the thousands of Menashsheh.”

<sup>18</sup> And of Zeḇulun he said, “Rejoice, O Zeḇulun, in your going out, and Yissasḵar in your tents!

<sup>19</sup> “They call peoples to the mountain, there they bring offerings of righteousness, for they draw from the riches of the seas, and treasures hidden in the sand.”

<sup>20</sup> And of Gaḏ he said, “Blessed is he who enlarges Gaḏ. He dwells as a lion, and shall tear off the arm, also the crown.

<sup>21</sup> “And he chose the best for himself, for there the portion of the lawgiver was hidden. And he came with the heads of the people. The righteousness of יהוה he did, and His right-rulings with Yisra’ĕl.”

<sup>22</sup> And of Dan he said, “Dan is a lion’s cub, that leaps from Bashan.”

<sup>23</sup> And of Naphtali he said, “O Naphtali, satisfied with pleasure, and filled with the blessing of יהוה, possess the west and the south.”

<sup>24</sup> And of Ashĕr he said, “Ashĕr is most blessed of sons. Let him be accepted by his brothers, and dip his foot in oil.

<sup>25</sup> “Your sandals are iron and bronze, and your strength as your days.

<sup>26</sup> “O Yeshurun, there is no one like Ĕl, riding the heavens to help you, and on the clouds, in His excellency.

<sup>27</sup> “The Elohim of old is a refuge, and beneath are everlasting arms. And He drives out the enemy from before you and says, ‘Destroy!’

<sup>28</sup> “Thus Yisra’ĕl dwells in safety, the fountain of Ya‛aqoḇ alone, in a land of grain and new wine. His heavens also drop down dew.

<sup>29</sup> “Blessed are you, O Yisra’ĕl! Who is like you, a people saved by יהוה, the shield of your help, and He who is the sword of your excellency! And your enemies are subdued for you, and you tread down their high places.”
