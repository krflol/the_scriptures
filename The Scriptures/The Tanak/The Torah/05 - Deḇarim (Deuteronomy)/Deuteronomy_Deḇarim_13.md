<sup>1</sup> “When there arises among you a prophet or a dreamer of dreams, and he shall give you a sign or a wonder,

<sup>2</sup> and the sign or the wonder shall come true, of which he has spoken to you, saying, ‘Let us go after other mighty ones – which you have not known – and serve them,’

<sup>3</sup> do not listen to the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams, for יהוה your Elohim is trying you to know whether you love יהוה your Elohim with all your heart and with all your being.

<sup>4</sup> “Walk after יהוה your Elohim and fear Him, and guard His commands and obey His voice, and serve Him and cling to Him.

<sup>5</sup> “And that prophet or that dreamer of dreams is put to death, because he has spoken apostasy against יהוה your Elohim – who brought you out of the land of Mitsrayim and redeemed you from the house of bondage – to make you stray from the way in which יהוה your Elohim commanded you to walk. Thus you shall purge the evil from your midst.

<sup>6</sup> “When your brother, the son of your mother, or your son or your daughter, or the wife of your bosom, or your friend who is as your own being, entices you secretly, saying, ‘Let us go and serve other mighty ones’– which you have not known, neither you nor your fathers,

<sup>7</sup> of the mighty ones of the people which are all around you, near to you or far off from you, from one end of the earth to the other end of the earth –

<sup>8</sup> do not agree with him or listen to him, nor shall your eye pardon him, nor spare him or conceal him,

<sup>9</sup> but you shall certainly kill him. Your hand is first against him to put him to death, and afterward the hand of all the people,

<sup>10</sup> and you shall stone him with stones until he dies, because he sought to entice you away from יהוה your Elohim, who brought you out of the land of Mitsrayim, from the house of bondage.

<sup>11</sup> “And let all Yisra’ĕl hear and fear, and not again do any such evil matter as this in your midst.

<sup>12</sup> “When you hear someone in one of your cities, which יהוה your Elohim gives you to dwell in, saying,

<sup>13</sup> ‘Some men, sons of Beliya‛al, have gone out of you midst and led the inhabitants of their city astray, saying, “Let us go and serve other mighty ones” ’ – mighty ones whom you have not known –

<sup>14</sup> then you shall inquire, search out, and ask diligently. And see if the matter is true and established that this abomination was done in your midst,

<sup>15</sup> you shall certainly smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, putting it under the ban, and all that is in it and its livestock, with the edge of the sword.

<sup>16</sup> “And gather all its plunder into the middle of the street, and completely burn with fire the city and all its plunder, before יהוה your Elohim. And it shall be a heap forever, never to be built again.

<sup>17</sup> “And none of that which is put under the ban is to cling to your hand, so that יהוה turns from the fierceness of His displeasure and shall show you compassion, love you and increase you, as He swore to your fathers,

<sup>18</sup> when you obey the voice of יהוה your Elohim, to guard all His commands which I command you today, to do what is right in the eyes of יהוה your Elohim.
