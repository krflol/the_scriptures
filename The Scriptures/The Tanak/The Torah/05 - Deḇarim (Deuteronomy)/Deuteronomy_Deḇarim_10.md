<sup>1</sup> “At that time יהוה said to me, ‘Hew for yourself two tablets of stone like the first, and come up to Me on the mountain. And you shall make yourself an ark of wood,

<sup>2</sup> then I write on the tablets the Words that were on the first tablets, which you broke. And you shall put them in the ark.’

<sup>3</sup> “So I made an ark of acacia wood, hewed two tablets of stone like the first, and went up the mountain, with the two tablets in my hand.

<sup>4</sup> “And He wrote on the tablets according to the first writing, the Ten Words, which יהוה had spoken to you in the mountain from the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly. Then יהוה gave them to me,

<sup>5</sup> and I turned and came down from the mountain, and put the tablets in the ark which I had made. And they are there, as יהוה commanded me.”

<sup>6</sup> Now the children of Yisra’ĕl set out from the wells of Benĕi Ya‛aqan to Mosĕrah. Aharon died there, and he was buried there. And El‛azar his son became priest in his place.

<sup>7</sup> From there they set out to Guḏgoḏah, and from Guḏgoḏah to Yotḇathah, a land of rivers of water.

<sup>8</sup> At that time יהוה separated the tribe of Lĕwi to bear the ark of the covenant of יהוה, to stand before יהוה, to serve Him, and to bless in His Name, to this day.

<sup>9</sup> Therefore Lĕwi has no portion nor inheritance with his brothers. יהוה is his inheritance, as יהוה your Elohim promised him.

<sup>10</sup> “And I stayed in the mountain for forty days and forty nights. And יהוה heard me at that time also, and יהוה chose not to destroy you.

<sup>11</sup> “And יהוה said to me, ‘Arise, go before the people, to set out, and let them go in and possess the land which I swore to their fathers to give them.’

<sup>12</sup> “And now, Yisra’ĕl, what is יהוה your Elohim asking of you, but to fear יהוה your Elohim, to walk in all His ways and to love Him, and to serve יהוה your Elohim with all your heart and with all your being,

<sup>13</sup> to guard the commands of יהוה and His laws which I command you today for your good?

<sup>14</sup> “See, the heavens and the heaven of heavens belong to יהוה your Elohim, also the earth with all that is in it.

<sup>15</sup> “ יהוה delighted only in your fathers, to love them. And He chose their seed after them, you above all peoples, as it is today.

<sup>16</sup> “And you shall circumcise the foreskin of your heart, and harden your neck no more.

<sup>17</sup> “For יהוה your Elohim is Elohim of mighty ones and Master of masters, the great Ĕl, mighty and awesome, who shows no partiality nor takes a bribe.

<sup>18</sup> “He executes right-ruling for the fatherless and the widow, and loves the stranger, giving him food and a garment.

<sup>19</sup> “And you shall love the stranger, for you were strangers in the land of Mitsrayim.

<sup>20</sup> “Fear יהוה your Elohim. Serve Him, and cling to Him, and swear by His Name.

<sup>21</sup> “He is your praise, and He is your Elohim, who has done for you these great and awesome deeds which your eyes have seen.

<sup>22</sup> “Your fathers went down to Mitsrayim with seventy beings, and now יהוה your Elohim has made you as numerous as the stars of the heavens.
