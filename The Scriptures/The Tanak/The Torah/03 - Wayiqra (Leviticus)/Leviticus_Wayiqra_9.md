<sup>1</sup> And on the eighth day it came to be that Mosheh called Aharon and his sons and the elders of Yisra’ĕl.

<sup>2</sup> And he said to Aharon, “Take for yourself a young bull as a sin offering and a ram as a burnt offering, a perfect one, and bring them before יהוה.

<sup>3</sup> “And speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl, saying, ‘Take a male goat as a sin offering, and a calf and a lamb, both a year old, perfect ones, as a burnt offering,

<sup>4</sup> and a bull and a ram as peace offerings, to slaughter before יהוה, and a grain offering mixed with oil. For today יהוה shall appear to you.’ ”

<sup>5</sup> And they took what Mosheh commanded before the Tent of Meeting, and all the congregation drew near and stood before יהוה.

<sup>6</sup> And Mosheh said, “This is the word which יהוה commanded you to do, so that the esteem of יהוה appears to you.”

<sup>7</sup> And Mosheh said to Aharon, “Go to the altar, and prepare your sin offering and your burnt offering, and make atonement for yourself and for the people. And make the offering of the people, and make atonement for them, as יהוה has commanded.”

<sup>8</sup> So Aharon came near to the altar and slaughtered the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself.

<sup>9</sup> And the sons of Aharon brought the blood to him, and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it on the horns of the altar, and poured the blood at the base of the altar.

<sup>10</sup> And the fat, and the kidneys, and the appendage on the liver of the sin offering he burned on the altar, as יהוה had commanded Mosheh.

<sup>11</sup> And the flesh and the skin he burned with fire outside the camp.

<sup>12</sup> And he slaughtered the burnt offering, and the sons of Aharon presented to him the blood, which he sprinkled on the altar all around.

<sup>13</sup> And they presented the burnt offering to him, with its pieces and head, and he burned them on the altar.

<sup>14</sup> And he washed the entrails and the legs, and burned them with the burnt offering on the altar.

<sup>15</sup> And he brought the people’s offering, and took the goat, which was the sin offering for the people, and slaughtered it and made it a sin offering, like the first one.

<sup>16</sup> And he brought the burnt offering and made it, according to the right-ruling.

<sup>17</sup> He also brought the grain offering, and filled his hand with it, and burned it on the altar, besides the burnt offering of the morning.

<sup>18</sup> And he slaughtered the bull and the ram as peace offerings, which were for the people. And Aharon’s sons presented to him the blood, which he sprinkled on the altar all around,

<sup>19</sup> and the fat from the bull and the ram, the fat tail, and the covering, and the kidneys, and the appendage on the liver,

<sup>20</sup> and they placed the fat on the breasts, and he burned the fat on the altar.

<sup>21</sup> But the breasts and the right thigh Aharon waved as a wave offering before יהוה, as Mosheh had commanded.

<sup>22</sup> Aharon then lifted up his hand toward the people and blessed them, and came down from making the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace offerings.

<sup>23</sup> And Mosheh and Aharon went into the Tent of Meeting, and came out and blessed the people. And the esteem of יהוה appeared to all the people,

<sup>24</sup> and fire came out from before יהוה and consumed the burnt offering and the fat on the altar. And all the people saw and cried aloud and fell on their faces.

<sup>1</sup> And on the eighth day it came to be that Mosheh called Aharon and his sons and the elders of Yisra’ĕl.

<sup>2</sup> And he said to Aharon, “Take for yourself a young bull as a sin offering and a ram as a burnt offering, a perfect one, and bring them before יהוה.
