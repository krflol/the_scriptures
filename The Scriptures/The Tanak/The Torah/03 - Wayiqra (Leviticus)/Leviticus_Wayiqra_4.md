<sup>1</sup> And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,

<sup>2</sup> “Speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl, saying, ‘When a being sins by mistake against any of the commands of יהוה, which are not to be done, and shall do any of them:

<sup>3</sup> ‘If the anointed priest sins, bringing guilt on the people, then he shall bring to יהוה for his sin which he has sinned a young bull, a perfect one, as a sin offering,

<sup>4</sup> and he shall bring the bull to the door of the Tent of Meeting before יהוה, and shall lay his hand on the bull’s head, and slaughter the bull before יהוה.

<sup>5</sup> ‘And the anointed priest shall take some of the bull’s blood and bring it to the Tent of Meeting,

<sup>6</sup> and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle some of the blood seven times before יהוה, in front of the veil of the set-apart place.

<sup>7</sup> ‘And the priest shall put some of the blood on the horns of the altar of sweet incense before יהוה, which is in the Tent of Meeting, and pour all the blood of the bull at the base of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the Tent of Meeting.

<sup>8</sup> ‘Then he takes all the fat of the bull as the sin offering, the fat that covers the entrails and all the fat which is on the entrails,

<sup>9</sup> and the two kidneys and the fat that is on them by the loins, and the appendage on the liver, which he removes with the kidneys,

<sup>10</sup> as it was taken from the bull of the peace offering. And the priest shall burn them on the altar of the burnt offering.

<sup>11</sup> ‘But the skin of the bull, and all its flesh, with its head and legs, its entrails and dung –

<sup>12</sup> all of the bull – he shall bring outside the camp to a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn it on wood with fire. Where the ashes are poured out it is burned.

<sup>13</sup> ‘And if the entire congregation of Yisra’ĕl strays by mistake, and the matter has been hidden from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done against any of the commands of יהוה, which are not to be done, and shall be guilty,

<sup>14</sup> when the sin which they have sinned becomes known, then the assembly shall bring a young bull for the sin, and bring it before the Tent of Meeting.

<sup>15</sup> ‘And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands on the head of the bull before יהוה, and the bull shall be slaughtered before יהוה.

<sup>16</sup> ‘And the anointed priest shall bring some of the bull’s blood to the Tent of Meeting,

<sup>17</sup> and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle it seven times before יהוה, in front of the veil,

<sup>18</sup> and put some of the blood on the horns of the altar which is before יהוה, which is in the Tent of Meeting, and pour all the blood at the base of the altar of burnt offering, which is at the door of the Tent of Meeting.

<sup>19</sup> ‘Then he takes all the fat from it and shall burn it on the altar.

<sup>20</sup> ‘And he shall do with the bull as he did with the bull as a sin offering – so shall he do it. And the priest shall make atonement for them, and it shall be forgiven them.

<sup>21</sup> ‘And he shall bring the bull outside the camp, and burn it as he burned the first bull. It is a sin offering for the assembly.

<sup>22</sup> ‘When a ruler sins, and by mistake has done against any of the commands of יהוה his Elohim which are not to be done, and shall be guilty,

<sup>23</sup> or if his sin which he has sinned is made known to him, then he shall bring as his offering a buck of the goats, a male, a perfect one.

<sup>24</sup> ‘And he shall lay his hand on the head of the goat, and slaughter it at the place where they slaughter the burnt offering before יהוה. It is a sin offering.

<sup>25</sup> ‘And the priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and shall put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and pour its blood at the base of the altar of burnt offering,

<sup>26</sup> and burn all its fat on the altar, like the fat of the slaughtering of the peace offering. And the priest shall make atonement for him for his sin, and it shall be forgiven him.

<sup>27</sup> ‘And if any being of the people of the land sins by mistake by doing against any of the commands of יהוה which are not to be done, and shall be guilty,

<sup>28</sup> or if his sin which he has sinned shall be made known to him, then he shall bring as his offering a female goat, a perfect one, for his sin which he has sinned.

<sup>29</sup> ‘And he shall lay his hand on the head of the sin offering, and slaughter the sin offering at the place of the burnt offering.

<sup>30</sup> ‘And the priest shall take some of its blood with his finger, and shall put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and pour all the blood at the base of the altar,

<sup>31</sup> then remove all its fat, as fat is removed from the slaughtering of the peace offering. And the priest shall burn it on the altar for a sweet fragrance to יהוה. And the priest shall make atonement for him, and it shall be forgiven him.

<sup>32</sup> ‘And if he brings a lamb as his sin offering, he brings a female, a perfect one.

<sup>33</sup> ‘And he shall lay his hand on the head of the sin offering, and slaughter it as a sin offering at the place where they slaughter the burnt offering.

<sup>34</sup> ‘And the priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and shall put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and pour all the blood at the base of the altar.

<sup>35</sup> ‘Then he removes all its fat, as the fat of the lamb is removed from the slaughtering of the peace offering. And the priest shall burn it on the altar, according to the offerings made by fire to יהוה. So the priest shall make atonement for his sin that he has sinned, and it shall be forgiven him.
