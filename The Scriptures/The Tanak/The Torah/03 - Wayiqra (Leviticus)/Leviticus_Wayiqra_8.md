<sup>1</sup> And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,

<sup>2</sup> “Take Aharon and his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and the bull of the sin offering, and the two rams, and the basket of unleavened bread,

<sup>3</sup> and assemble all the congregation at the door of the Tent of Meeting.”

<sup>4</sup> And Mosheh did as יהוה commanded him, and the congregation was assembled at the door of the Tent of Meeting.

<sup>5</sup> And Mosheh said to the congregation, “This is the word יהוה commanded to be done.”

<sup>6</sup> So Mosheh brought Aharon and his sons and washed them with water,

<sup>7</sup> and put the long shirt on him, and girded him with the girdle, and dressed him in the robe, and put the shoulder garment on him, and girded him with the embroidered band of the shoulder garment, and with it tied the shoulder garment on him,

<sup>8</sup> and put the breastplate on him, and put the Urim and the Tummim in the breastplate,

<sup>9</sup> and put the turban on his head. And on the turban, on its front, he put the golden plate, the set-apart sign of dedication, as יהוה had commanded Mosheh.

<sup>10</sup> And Mosheh took the anointing oil and anointed the Dwelling Place and all that was in it, and set them apart.

<sup>11</sup> And he sprinkled some of it on the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all its utensils, and the basin and its base, to set them apart.

<sup>12</sup> And he poured some of the anointing oil on Aharon’s head and anointed him, to set him apart.

<sup>13</sup> And Mosheh brought the sons of Aharon and put long shirts on them, and girded them with girdles, and put turbans on them, as יהוה had commanded Mosheh.

<sup>14</sup> And he brought the bull for the sin offering, and Aharon and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bull for the sin offering,

<sup>15</sup> and it was slaughtered. And Mosheh took the blood, and put some on the horns of the altar all around with his finger, and cleansed the altar. And he poured the blood at the base of the altar, and set it apart, to make atonement for it.

<sup>16</sup> And he took all the fat that was on the entrails, and the appendage on the liver, and the two kidneys with their fat, and Mosheh burned them on the altar.

<sup>17</sup> And the bull, and its skin, and its flesh, and its dung, he burned with fire outside the camp, as יהוה had commanded Mosheh.

<sup>18</sup> And he brought the ram of the burnt offering, and Aharon and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram,

<sup>19</sup> and it was slaughtered. And Mosheh sprinkled the blood on the altar all around,

<sup>20</sup> and he cut the ram into pieces. And Mosheh burned the head, and the pieces, and the fat,

<sup>21</sup> and he washed the entrails and the legs in water. And Mosheh burned the entire ram on the altar. It was a burnt offering for a sweet fragrance, and an offering made by fire to יהוה, as יהוה had commanded Mosheh.

<sup>22</sup> And he brought the second ram, the ram of ordination, and Aharon and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram,

<sup>23</sup> and it was slaughtered. And Mosheh took some of its blood and put it on the tip of Aharon’s right ear, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot.

<sup>24</sup> And he brought near the sons of Aharon, and Mosheh put some of the blood on the tips of their right ears, and on the thumbs of their right hands, and on the big toes of their right feet. And Mosheh sprinkled the blood on the altar all around,

<sup>25</sup> and took the fat and the fat tail, and all the fat that was on the entrails, and the appendage on the liver, and the two kidneys and their fat, and the right thigh,

<sup>26</sup> and from the basket of unleavened bread that was before יהוה he took one unleavened cake, and a cake of bread anointed with oil, and one thin cake, and put them on the fat and on the right thigh,

<sup>27</sup> and placed all these in the hands of Aharon and in the hands of his sons, and waved them as a wave offering before יהוה.

<sup>28</sup> Mosheh then took them from their hands and burned them on the altar, on the burnt offering. They were ordinations for a sweet fragrance. It was an offering by fire to יהוה.

<sup>29</sup> And Mosheh took the breast and waved it, a wave offering before יהוה. It was Mosheh’s portion of the ram of ordination, as יהוה had commanded Mosheh.

<sup>30</sup> And Mosheh took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood which was on the altar, and sprinkled it on Aharon, on his garments, and on his sons, and on the garments of his sons with him. And he set apart Aharon, his garments, and his sons, and the garments of his sons with him.

<sup>31</sup> And Mosheh said to Aharon and his sons, “Cook the flesh at the door of the Tent of Meeting, and eat it there with the bread that is in the basket of the ordinations, as I have commanded, saying, ‘Aharon and his sons are to eat it.’

<sup>32</sup> “Then burn the rest of the flesh and the bread with fire.

<sup>33</sup> “And do not go outside the door of the Tent of Meeting for seven days, until the days of your ordination are completed – for he fills your hands for seven days.

<sup>34</sup> “ יהוה has commanded to do, as he has done this day, to make atonement for you.

<sup>35</sup> “And stay at the door of the Tent of Meeting day and night for seven days. And you shall guard the duty of יהוה, and not die, for so I have been commanded.”

<sup>36</sup> And Aharon and his sons did all the words that יהוה had commanded by the hand of Mosheh.

<sup>1</sup> And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,

<sup>2</sup> “Take Aharon and his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and the bull of the sin offering, and the two rams, and the basket of unleavened bread,

<sup>3</sup> and assemble all the congregation at the door of the Tent of Meeting.”

<sup>4</sup> And Mosheh did as יהוה commanded him, and the congregation was assembled at the door of the Tent of Meeting.

<sup>5</sup> And Mosheh said to the congregation, “This is the word יהוה commanded to be done.”

<sup>6</sup> So Mosheh brought Aharon and his sons and washed them with water,

<sup>7</sup> and put the long shirt on him, and girded him with the girdle, and dressed him in the robe, and put the shoulder garment on him, and girded him with the embroidered band of the shoulder garment, and with it tied the shoulder garment on him,

<sup>8</sup> and put the breastplate on him, and put the Urim and the Tummim in the breastplate,

<sup>9</sup> and put the turban on his head. And on the turban, on its front, he put the golden plate, the set-apart sign of dedication, as יהוה had commanded Mosheh.

<sup>10</sup> And Mosheh took the anointing oil and anointed the Dwelling Place and all that was in it, and set them apart.

<sup>11</sup> And he sprinkled some of it on the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all its utensils, and the basin and its base, to set them apart.

<sup>12</sup> And he poured some of the anointing oil on Aharon’s head and anointed him, to set him apart.

<sup>13</sup> And Mosheh brought the sons of Aharon and put long shirts on them, and girded them with girdles, and put turbans on them, as יהוה had commanded Mosheh.

<sup>14</sup> And he brought the bull for the sin offering, and Aharon and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bull for the sin offering,

<sup>15</sup> and it was slaughtered. And Mosheh took the blood, and put some on the horns of the altar all around with his finger, and cleansed the altar. And he poured the blood at the base of the altar, and set it apart, to make atonement for it.

<sup>16</sup> And he took all the fat that was on the entrails, and the appendage on the liver, and the two kidneys with their fat, and Mosheh burned them on the altar.

<sup>28</sup> Mosheh then took them from their hands and burned them on the altar, on the burnt offering. They were ordinations for a sweet fragrance. It was an offering by fire to יהוה.

<sup>30</sup> And Mosheh took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood which was on the altar, and sprinkled it on Aharon, on his garments, and on his sons, and on the garments of his sons with him. And he set apart Aharon, his garments, and his sons, and the garments of his sons with him.

<sup>31</sup> And Mosheh said to Aharon and his sons, “Cook the flesh at the door of the Tent of Meeting, and eat it there with the bread that is in the basket of the ordinations, as I have commanded, saying, ‘Aharon and his sons are to eat it.’

<sup>32</sup> “Then burn the rest of the flesh and the bread with fire.

<sup>35</sup> “And stay at the door of the Tent of Meeting day and night for seven days. And you shall guard the duty of יהוה, and not die, for so I have been commanded.”

<sup>36</sup> And Aharon and his sons did all the words that יהוה had commanded by the hand of Mosheh.

<sup>1</sup> And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
