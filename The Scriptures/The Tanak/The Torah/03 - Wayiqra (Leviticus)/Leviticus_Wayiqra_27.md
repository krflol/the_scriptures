<sup>1</sup> And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,

<sup>2</sup> “Speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl, and say to them, ‘When a man separates a vow, by your evaluation of lives unto יהוה,

<sup>3</sup> when your evaluation is of a male from twenty years old up to sixty years old, then your evaluation shall be fifty sheqels of silver, according to the sheqel of the set-apart place.

<sup>4</sup> ‘And if it is a female, then your evaluation shall be thirty sheqels;

<sup>5</sup> and if from five years old up to twenty years old, then your evaluation for a male shall be twenty sheqels, and for a female ten sheqels;

<sup>6</sup> and if from a month old up to five years old, then your evaluation for a male shall be five sheqels of silver, and for a female your evaluation shall be three sheqels of silver;

<sup>7</sup> and if from sixty years old and above, if it is a male, then your evaluation shall be fifteen sheqels, and for a female ten sheqels.

<sup>8</sup> ‘But if he is too poor to pay your evaluation, then he shall present himself before the priest, and the priest shall set a value for him. According to the ability of him who vowed, the priest shall value him.

<sup>9</sup> ‘And if it is a beast of which they bring an offering to יהוה, all such given to יהוה is set-apart.

<sup>10</sup> ‘He is not to replace it or exchange it, good for spoilt or spoilt for good. And if he at all exchanges beast for beast, then both it and the one exchanged for it is set-apart.

<sup>11</sup> ‘And if it is any unclean beast of which they do not bring an offering to יהוה, then he shall present the beast before the priest;

<sup>12</sup> and the priest shall value it, whether it is good or spoilt. According to your evaluation, O priest, so it shall be.

<sup>13</sup> ‘But if he indeed redeems it, then he shall add one-fifth to your evaluation.

<sup>14</sup> ‘And when a man sets his house apart, to be set-apart to יהוה, then the priest shall value it, whether it is good or spoilt. As the priest values it, so it stands.

<sup>15</sup> ‘And if he who sets it apart does redeem his house, then he shall add one-fifth of the silver of your evaluation to it, and it shall be his.

<sup>16</sup> ‘And if a man sets apart to יהוה a field he owns, then your evaluation shall be according to the seed for it – a ḥomer of barley seed at fifty sheqels of silver.

<sup>17</sup> ‘If he sets his field apart from the Year of Jubilee, according to your evaluation it stands.

<sup>18</sup> ‘But if he sets his field apart after the Jubilee, then the priest shall reckon to him the silver due according to the years that remain till the Year of Jubilee, and it shall be deducted from your evaluation.

<sup>19</sup> ‘And if he who sets the field apart ever wishes to redeem it, then he shall add one-fifth of the silver of your evaluation to it, and it shall be his.

<sup>20</sup> ‘And if he does not redeem the field, or if he has sold the field to another man, it is no longer redeemed,

<sup>21</sup> but the field, when it is released in the Jubilee, is set-apart to יהוה as a dedicated field, to be the possession of the priest.

<sup>22</sup> ‘And if a man sets apart to יהוה a field which he has bought, which is not the field of his possession,

<sup>23</sup> then the priest shall reckon to him the amount of your evaluation, up to the Year of Jubilee, and he shall give your evaluation on that day, set-apart to יהוה.

<sup>24</sup> ‘In the Year of Jubilee the field returns to him from whom he bought it, to him whose is the possession of the land.

<sup>25</sup> ‘And all your evaluations is to be according to the sheqel of the set-apart place: twenty gĕrahs to the sheqel.

<sup>26</sup> ‘However, a first-born of the beasts, which is first-born to יהוה, no man sets it apart – whether bull or sheep, it belongs to יהוה.

<sup>27</sup> ‘And if among the unclean beasts, then he shall ransom it according to your evaluation, and shall add one-fifth to it. And if it is not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to your evaluation.

<sup>28</sup> ‘However, whatever a man lays under ban for יהוה of all that he has, man and beast, or the field of his possession, is not sold or redeemed. Whatever is laid under ban is most set-apart to יהוה.

<sup>29</sup> ‘No one under the ban, under the ban among men, is ransomed, but shall certainly be put to death.

<sup>30</sup> ‘And all the tithe of the land – of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the tree – belongs to יהוה. It is set-apart to יהוה.

<sup>31</sup> ‘If a man indeed redeems any of his tithes, he adds one-fifth to it.

<sup>32</sup> ‘And the entire tithe of the herd and of the flock, all that passes under the rod, the tenth one is set-apart to יהוה.

<sup>33</sup> ‘He does not inquire whether it is good or spoilt, nor does he exchange it. And if he exchanges it at all, then both it and the one exchanged for it are set-apart, it is not redeemed.’ ”
