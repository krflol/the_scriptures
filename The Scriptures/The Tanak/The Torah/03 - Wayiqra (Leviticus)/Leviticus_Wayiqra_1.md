<sup>1</sup> And יהוה called to Mosheh, and spoke to him from the Tent of Meeting, saying,

<sup>2</sup> “Speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl, and say to them, ‘When anyone of you brings an offering to יהוה, you bring your offering of the livestock, of the herd or of the flock.

<sup>3</sup> ‘If his offering is a burnt offering of the herd, let him bring a male, a perfect one. Let him bring it at the door of the Tent of Meeting, for his acceptance before יהוה.

<sup>4</sup> ‘And he shall lay his hand on the head of the burnt offering, and it shall be accepted on his behalf to make atonement for him.

<sup>5</sup> ‘And he shall slaughter the bull before יהוה. And the sons of Aharon, the priests, shall bring the blood and sprinkle the blood all around on the altar which is at the door of the Tent of Meeting.

<sup>6</sup> ‘And he shall skin the burnt offering and cut it into its pieces.

<sup>7</sup> ‘And the sons of Aharon the priest shall put fire on the altar, and lay the wood in order on the fire.

<sup>8</sup> ‘And the sons of Aharon, the priests, shall arrange the pieces, with the head and the fat on the wood which is on the fire on the altar.

<sup>9</sup> ‘But its entrails and its legs he washes with water. And the priest shall burn all of it on the altar as a burnt offering, an offering made by fire, a sweet fragrance to יהוה.

<sup>10</sup> ‘And if his offering is from the flock, from the sheep or from the goats as a burnt offering, let him bring a male, a perfect one.

<sup>11</sup> ‘And he shall slaughter it on the north side of the altar before יהוה. And the sons of Aharon, the priests, shall sprinkle its blood on the altar all around.

<sup>12</sup> ‘And he shall cut it into its pieces, with its head and its fat, and the priest shall arrange them on the wood which is on the fire on the altar.

<sup>13</sup> ‘But the entrails and the legs he washes with water. And the priest shall bring it all and burn it on the altar. It is a burnt offering, an offering made by fire, a sweet fragrance to יהוה.

<sup>14</sup> ‘And if the burnt offering of his offering to יהוה is of birds, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves or young pigeons.

<sup>15</sup> ‘And the priest shall bring it to the altar, and shall wring off its head, and burn it on the altar, and its blood shall be drained out at the side of the altar.

<sup>16</sup> ‘And he shall remove its crop with its feathers and throw it beside the altar on the east side, into the place for ashes.

<sup>17</sup> ‘And he shall split it at its wings, but not sever it. And the priest shall burn it on the altar, on the wood that is on the fire. It is a burnt offering, an offering made by fire, a sweet fragrance to יהוה.
