<sup>1</sup> And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,

<sup>2</sup> “Speak to Aharon and his sons, that they separate themselves from the set-apart offerings of the children of Yisra’ĕl, and that they do not profane My set-apart Name in what they set apart to Me. I am יהוה.

<sup>3</sup> “Say to them, ‘Any man of all your offspring throughout your generations who draws near the set-apart offerings which the children of Yisra’ĕl set apart to יהוה, while he has uncleanness upon him, that being shall be cut off from before Me. I am יהוה.

<sup>4</sup> ‘Any man of the offspring of Aharon, who is a leper or has a discharge, does not eat the set-apart offerings until he is clean. And whoever touches what is rendered unclean by a corpse, or a man who has had an emission of semen,

<sup>5</sup> or a man who touches any creeping creature by which he would be made unclean, or any being by whom he would become unclean, even any of his uncleanness;

<sup>6</sup> the being who has touched it shall be unclean until evening, and does not eat the set-apart offerings, but shall bathe his body in water.

<sup>7</sup> ‘And when the sun goes down he shall be clean, and afterward eat the set-apart offerings, because it is his food.

<sup>8</sup> ‘He does not eat that which dies or is torn by beasts, becoming unclean by it. I am יהוה.

<sup>9</sup> ‘And they shall guard My Charge, lest they bear sin for it and die thereby, when they profane it. I יהוה set them apart.

<sup>10</sup> ‘And no stranger eats the set-apart offering. A sojourner with the priest, or a hired servant, does not eat the set-apart offering.

<sup>11</sup> ‘But when the priest buys a being with his money, he does eat of it. And one who is born in his house does eat his food.

<sup>12</sup> ‘And when a priest’s daughter is married to a stranger, she does not eat of the set-apart offerings.

<sup>13</sup> ‘But when a priest’s daughter is a widow or put away, and has no child, and has returned to her father’s house as in her youth, she does eat her father’s food, but no stranger eats of it.

<sup>14</sup> ‘And when a man eats the set-apart offering by mistake, then he shall give a set-apart offering to the priest, and add one-fifth to it.

<sup>15</sup> ‘And let the priests not profane the set-apart offerings of the children of Yisra’ĕl, which they lift up to יהוה,

<sup>16</sup> or allow them to bear the crookedness of trespass when they eat their set-apart offerings. For I am יהוה, who sets them apart.’ ”
