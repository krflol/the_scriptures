<sup>1</sup> And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,

<sup>2</sup> “Speak to all the congregation of the children of Yisra’ĕl, and say to them, ‘Be set-apart, for I יהוה your Elohim am set-apart.

<sup>3</sup> ‘Each one of you should fear his mother and his father, and guard My Sabbaths. I am יהוה your Elohim.

<sup>4</sup> ‘Do not turn to idols, and do not make for yourselves moulded mighty ones. I am יהוה your Elohim.

<sup>5</sup> ‘And when you bring a peace offering to יהוה, bring it for your acceptance.

<sup>6</sup> ‘It is eaten the same day you slaughter it, and on the next day. And that which is left on the third day is burned with fire.

<sup>7</sup> ‘So if it is eaten at all on the third day, it is abominable, it is not accepted,

<sup>8</sup> and he who eats it bears his crookedness, because he has profaned the set-apart offering of יהוה, and that being shall be cut off from his people.

<sup>9</sup> ‘And when you reap the harvest of your land, do not completely reap the corners of your field or gather the gleanings of your harvest.

<sup>10</sup> ‘And do not glean your vineyard or gather every grape of your vineyard, leave them for the poor and the stranger. I am יהוה your Elohim.

<sup>11</sup> ‘Do not steal, do not lie, do not deceive one another.

<sup>12</sup> ‘And do not swear falsely by My Name and so profane the Name of your Elohim. I am יהוה.

<sup>13</sup> ‘Do not oppress your neighbour or rob him. The wages of him who is hired is not to remain with you all night until morning.

<sup>14</sup> ‘Do not curse the deaf or put a stumbling-block before the blind, but fear your Elohim. I am יהוה.

<sup>15</sup> ‘Do no unrighteousness in right-ruling. Do not be partial to the poor or favour the face of the great, but rightly rule your neighbour in righteousness.

<sup>16</sup> ‘Do not go slandering among your people. Do not stand against the blood of your neighbour. I am יהוה.

<sup>17</sup> ‘Do not hate your brother in your heart. Reprove your neighbour, for certain, and bear no sin because of him.

<sup>18</sup> ‘Do not take vengeance or bear a grudge against the children of your people. And you shall love your neighbour as yourself. I am יהוה.

<sup>19</sup> ‘Guard My laws. Do not let your livestock mate with another kind. Do not sow your field with mixed seed. And do not put a garment woven of two sorts of thread upon you.

<sup>20</sup> ‘And when a man has intercourse with a woman who is a female servant, engaged to a man, and who has not at all been ransomed nor redeemed, there should be an inquiry. But they are not put to death, because she was not free.

<sup>21</sup> ‘And he shall bring his guilt offering to יהוה, to the door of the Tent of Meeting, a ram as a guilt offering.

<sup>22</sup> ‘And the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt offering before יהוה for his sin which he has done. And the sin which he has sinned shall be forgiven him.

<sup>23</sup> ‘And when you come into the land, and have planted all kinds of trees for food, then you shall reckon their fruit as uncircumcised. For three years it is as uncircumcised to you, it is not eaten.

<sup>24</sup> ‘And in the fourth year all its fruit is set-apart – praises to יהוה.

<sup>25</sup> ‘And in the fifth year you eat its fruit, so that it increases its yield to you. I am יהוה your Elohim.

<sup>26</sup> ‘Do not eat meat with the blood. Do not practise divination or magic.

<sup>27</sup> ‘Do not round the corner of your head, nor destroy the corner of your beard.

<sup>28</sup> ‘And do not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor put tattoo marks on you. I am יהוה.

<sup>29</sup> ‘Do not profane your daughter by making her a whore, so that the land does not whore, and the land becomes filled with wickedness.

<sup>30</sup> ‘Guard My Sabbaths and reverence My set-apart place. I am יהוה.

<sup>31</sup> ‘Do not turn to mediums, and do not seek after spiritists to be defiled by them. I am יהוה your Elohim.

<sup>32</sup> ‘Rise up before the grey-headed. And you shall favour the face of an old man, and shall fear your Elohim. I am יהוה.

<sup>33</sup> ‘And when a stranger sojourns with you in your land, do not oppress him.

<sup>34</sup> ‘Let the stranger who dwells among you be to you as the native among you, and you shall love him as yourself. For you were strangers in the land of Mitsrayim. I am יהוה your Elohim.

<sup>35</sup> ‘Do no unrighteousness in right-ruling, in measurement of length, in weight, or in measuring liquids.

<sup>36</sup> ‘Have right scales, right weights, a right ĕphah, and a right hin. I am יהוה your Elohim, who brought you out of the land of Mitsrayim.
