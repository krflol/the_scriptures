<sup>1</sup> And it came to be in the days of Amraphel sovereign of Shin‛ar, Aryoḵ sovereign of Ellasar, Keḏorla‛omer sovereign of Ĕylam, and Tiḏ‛al sovereign of Goyim,

<sup>2</sup> that they fought against Bera sovereign of Seḏom, Birsha sovereign of Amorah, Shinaḇ sovereign of Aḏmah, Shem’ĕḇer sovereign of Tseḇoyim, and the sovereign of Bela, that is Tso‛ar.

<sup>3</sup> All these joined together in the Valley of Siddim, that is the Salt Sea.

<sup>4</sup> Twelve years they served Keḏorla‛omer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled.

<sup>5</sup> And in the fourteenth year Keḏorla‛omer and the sovereigns that were with him came and smote the Repha’im in Ashteroth Qarnayim, and the Zuzim in Ḥam, and the Ĕmites in Shawĕh Qiryathayim,

<sup>6</sup> and the Ḥorites in their mountain of Sĕ‛ir, as far as Ĕl Paran, which is by the wilderness.

<sup>7</sup> And they turned back and came to Ĕn Mishpat, that is Qaḏĕsh, and smote all the country of the Amalĕqites, and also the Amorites who dwelt in Ḥatsetson Tamar.

<sup>8</sup> And the sovereign of Seḏom, and the sovereign of Amorah, and the sovereign of Aḏmah, and the sovereign of Tseḇoyim, and the sovereign of Bela, that is Tso‛ar, went out and joined together in battle in the Valley of Siddim,

<sup>9</sup> against Keḏorla‛omer sovereign of Ĕylam, and Tiḏ‛al sovereign of Goyim, and Amraphel sovereign of Shin‛ar, and Aryoḵ sovereign of Ellasar – four sovereigns against five.

<sup>10</sup> And the Valley of Siddim had many tar pits. And the sovereigns of Seḏom and Amorah fled and fell there, and the remainder fled to the mountains.

<sup>11</sup> And they took all the goods of Seḏom and Amorah, and all their food, and went away.

<sup>12</sup> And they took Lot, Aḇram’s brother’s son who dwelt in Seḏom, and his goods, and left.

<sup>13</sup> And one who had escaped came and informed Aḇram the Heḇrew, for he dwelt by the terebinth trees of Mamrĕ the Amorite, brother of Eshkol and brother of Anĕr, and they had a covenant with Aḇram.

<sup>14</sup> And when Aḇram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his three hundred and eighteen trained servants who were born in his own house, and went in pursuit as far as Dan.

<sup>15</sup> And he and his servants divided against them by night, and smote them and pursued them as far as Ḥoḇah, which is on the left of Damascus.

<sup>16</sup> So he brought back all the goods, and also brought back his brother Lot and his goods, as well as the women and the people.

<sup>17</sup> And after his return from the defeat of Keḏorla‛omer and the sovereigns who were with him, the sovereign of Seḏom came out to meet him at the Valley of Shawĕh, that is, the Sovereign’s Valley.

<sup>18</sup> And Malkitseḏeq sovereign of Shalĕm brought out bread and wine. Now he was the priest of the Most High Ĕl.

<sup>19</sup> And he blessed him and said, “Blessed be Aḇram of the Most High Ĕl, Possessor of the heavens and earth.

<sup>20</sup> “And blessed be the Most High Ĕl who has delivered your enemies into your hand.” And he gave him a tenth of all.

<sup>21</sup> And the sovereign of Seḏom said to Aḇram, “Give me the people, and take the goods for yourself.”

<sup>22</sup> But Aḇram said to the sovereign of Seḏom, “I have lifted my hand to יהוה, the Most High Ĕl, the Possessor of the heavens and earth,

<sup>23</sup> not to take a thread or a sandal strap or whatever is yours, lest you should say, ‘I have made Aḇram rich,’

<sup>24</sup> except only what the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men who went with me: Anĕr, Eshkol, and Mamrĕ. Let them take their portion.”

<sup>1</sup> And it came to be in the days of Amraphel sovereign of Shin‛ar, Aryoḵ sovereign of Ellasar, Keḏorla‛omer sovereign of Ĕylam, and Tiḏ‛al sovereign of Goyim,

<sup>2</sup> that they fought against Bera sovereign of Seḏom, Birsha sovereign of Amorah, Shinaḇ sovereign of Aḏmah, Shem’ĕḇer sovereign of Tseḇoyim, and the sovereign of Bela, that is Tso‛ar.

<sup>3</sup> All these joined together in the Valley of Siddim, that is the Salt Sea.

<sup>4</sup> Twelve years they served Keḏorla‛omer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled.

<sup>5</sup> And in the fourteenth year Keḏorla‛omer and the sovereigns that were with him came and smote the Repha’im in Ashteroth Qarnayim, and the Zuzim in Ḥam, and the Ĕmites in Shawĕh Qiryathayim,

<sup>6</sup> and the Ḥorites in their mountain of Sĕ‛ir, as far as Ĕl Paran, which is by the wilderness.

<sup>7</sup> And they turned back and came to Ĕn Mishpat, that is Qaḏĕsh, and smote all the country of the Amalĕqites, and also the Amorites who dwelt in Ḥatsetson Tamar.

<sup>8</sup> And the sovereign of Seḏom, and the sovereign of Amorah, and the sovereign of Aḏmah, and the sovereign of Tseḇoyim, and the sovereign of Bela, that is Tso‛ar, went out and joined together in battle in the Valley of Siddim,

<sup>9</sup> against Keḏorla‛omer sovereign of Ĕylam, and Tiḏ‛al sovereign of Goyim, and Amraphel sovereign of Shin‛ar, and Aryoḵ sovereign of Ellasar – four sovereigns against five.

<sup>10</sup> And the Valley of Siddim had many tar pits. And the sovereigns of Seḏom and Amorah fled and fell there, and the remainder fled to the mountains.

<sup>11</sup> And they took all the goods of Seḏom and Amorah, and all their food, and went away.

<sup>12</sup> And they took Lot, Aḇram’s brother’s son who dwelt in Seḏom, and his goods, and left.

<sup>13</sup> And one who had escaped came and informed Aḇram the Heḇrew, for he dwelt by the terebinth trees of Mamrĕ the Amorite, brother of Eshkol and brother of Anĕr, and they had a covenant with Aḇram.

<sup>14</sup> And when Aḇram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his three hundred and eighteen trained servants who were born in his own house, and went in pursuit as far as Dan.

<sup>15</sup> And he and his servants divided against them by night, and smote them and pursued them as far as Ḥoḇah, which is on the left of Damascus.

<sup>16</sup> So he brought back all the goods, and also brought back his brother Lot and his goods, as well as the women and the people.

<sup>17</sup> And after his return from the defeat of Keḏorla‛omer and the sovereigns who were with him, the sovereign of Seḏom came out to meet him at the Valley of Shawĕh, that is, the Sovereign’s Valley.

<sup>18</sup> And Malkitseḏeq sovereign of Shalĕm brought out bread and wine. Now he was the priest of the Most High Ĕl.

<sup>21</sup> And the sovereign of Seḏom said to Aḇram, “Give me the people, and take the goods for yourself.”

<sup>22</sup> But Aḇram said to the sovereign of Seḏom, “I have lifted my hand to יהוה, the Most High Ĕl, the Possessor of the heavens and earth,
