<sup>1</sup> And יהוה said to Aḇram, “Go yourself out of your land, from your relatives and from your father’s house, to a land which I show you.

<sup>2</sup> “And I shall make you a great nation, and bless you and make your name great, and you shall be a blessing!

<sup>3</sup> “And I shall bless those who bless you, and curse him who curses you. And in you all the clans of the earth shall be blessed.”

<sup>4</sup> So Aḇram left, as יהוה had commanded him, and Lot went with him. And Aḇram was seventy-five years old when he set out from Ḥaran.

<sup>5</sup> And Aḇram took Sarai his wife and Lot his brother’s son, and all their possessions that they had gathered, and the beings whom they had acquired in Ḥaran, and they set out for the land of Kena‛an. And they came to the land of Kena‛an.

<sup>6</sup> And Aḇram passed through the land to the place of Sheḵem, as far as the terebinth tree of Moreh. At that time the Kena‛anites were in the land.

<sup>7</sup> And יהוה appeared to Aḇram and said, “To your seed I give this land.” And he built there an altar to יהוה, who had appeared to him.

<sup>8</sup> And from there he moved to the mountain east of Bĕyth Ĕl, and he pitched his tent, with Bĕyth Ĕl on the west and Ai on the east. And he built there an altar to יהוה, and called on the Name of יהוה.

<sup>9</sup> And Aḇram set out, continuing toward the South.

<sup>10</sup> And a scarcity of food came to be in the land, and Aḇram went down to Mitsrayim to dwell there, for the scarcity of food was severe in the land.

<sup>11</sup> And it came to be, when he was close to entering Mitsrayim, that he said to Sarai his wife, “See, I know that you are a fair woman to look at.

<sup>12</sup> “And it shall be, when the Mitsrites see you, that they shall say, ‘This is his wife.’ And they shall kill me, but let you live.

<sup>13</sup> “Please say you are my sister, so that it shall be well with me for your sake, and my life be spared because of you.”

<sup>14</sup> And it came to be, when Aḇram came into Mitsrayim, that the Mitsrites saw the woman, that she was very fair.

<sup>15</sup> And Pharaoh’s officials saw her and praised her before Pharaoh, and the woman was taken to Pharaoh’s house.

<sup>16</sup> And he treated Aḇram well for her sake, and he had sheep, and cattle, and male donkeys, and male and female servants, and female donkeys, and camels.

<sup>17</sup> But יהוה plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Aḇram’s wife.

<sup>18</sup> And Pharaoh called Aḇram and said, “What is this you have done to me? Why did you not inform me that she was your wife?

<sup>19</sup> “Why did you say, ‘She is my sister’? And so I was going to take her for my wife. Look, here is your wife, take her and go.”

<sup>20</sup> And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him, and they sent him away, with his wife and all that he had.

<sup>1</sup> And יהוה said to Aḇram, “Go yourself out of your land, from your relatives and from your father’s house, to a land which I show you.

<sup>2</sup> “And I shall make you a great nation, and bless you and make your name great, and you shall be a blessing!
