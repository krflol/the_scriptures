<sup>1</sup> And Elohim said to Ya‛aqoḇ, “Arise, go up to Bĕyth Ĕl and dwell there. And make an altar there to Ĕl who appeared to you when you fled from the face of Ĕsaw your brother.”

<sup>2</sup> And Ya‛aqoḇ said to his household and to all who were with him, “Put away the foreign mighty ones that are among you, and cleanse yourselves, and change your garments.

<sup>3</sup> “And let us arise and go up to Bĕyth Ĕl, and let me make there an altar to Ĕl, who answered me in the day of my distress, and has been with me in the way which I have gone.”

<sup>4</sup> So they gave Ya‛aqoḇ all the foreign mighty ones which were in their hands, and all their earrings which were in their ears. And Ya‛aqoḇ hid them under the terebinth tree which was near Sheḵem.

<sup>5</sup> And they departed, and the fear of Elohim was upon the cities that were all around them, and they did not pursue the sons of Ya‛aqoḇ.

<sup>6</sup> And Ya‛aqoḇ came to Luz, that is Bĕyth Ĕl, which is in the land of Kena‛an, he and all the people who were with him.

<sup>7</sup> And he built there an altar and called the place El Bĕyth Ĕl, because there Elohim appeared to him when he fled from the face of his brother.

<sup>8</sup> And Deḇorah, Riḇqah’s nurse, died, and she was buried below Bĕyth Ĕl under the terebinth tree. So the name of it was called Allon Baḵuth.

<sup>9</sup> And Elohim appeared to Ya‛aqoḇ again, when he came from Paddan Aram, and blessed him.

<sup>10</sup> And Elohim said to him, “Your name is Ya‛aqoḇ, your name is no longer called Ya‛aqoḇ, but Yisra’ĕl is your name.” So He called his name Yisra’ĕl.

<sup>11</sup> And Elohim said to him, “I am Ĕl Shaddai. Bear fruit and increase, a nation and a company of nations shall be from you, and sovereigns come from your body.

<sup>12</sup> “And the land which I gave Aḇraham and Yitsḥaq I give to you. And to your seed after you I give this land.”

<sup>13</sup> And Elohim went up from him in the place where He had spoken with him.

<sup>14</sup> And Ya‛aqoḇ set up a standing column in the place where He had spoken with him, a monument of stone. And he poured a drink offering on it, and he poured oil on it.

<sup>15</sup> And Ya‛aqoḇ called the name of the place where Elohim spoke with him, Bĕyth Ĕl.

<sup>16</sup> Then they set out from Bĕyth Ĕl. And it came to be, when there was but a little distance to go to Ephrath, that Raḥĕl began to give birth, and had great difficulty giving birth.

<sup>17</sup> And it came to be, as she was having great difficulty giving birth, that the midwife said to her, “Do not fear, for it is another son for you.”

<sup>18</sup> And it came to be, as her life was going out – for she died – that she called his name Ben-Oni. But his father called him Binyamin.

<sup>19</sup> So Raḥĕl died and was buried on the way to Ephrath, that is Bĕyth Leḥem.

<sup>20</sup> And Ya‛aqoḇ set a standing column on her grave, which is the monument of Raḥĕl’s grave to this day.

<sup>21</sup> And Yisra’ĕl set out and pitched his tent beyond the tower of Ĕḏer.

<sup>22</sup> And it came to be, when Yisra’ĕl dwelt in that land, that Re’uḇĕn went and lay with Bilhah his father’s concubine. And Yisra’ĕl heard about it. Now the sons of Ya‛aqoḇ were twelve:

<sup>23</sup> the sons of Lĕ’ah were Re’uḇĕn, Ya‛aqoḇ’s first-born, and Shim‛on, and Lĕwi, and Yehuḏah, and Yissasḵar, and Zeḇulun;

<sup>24</sup> the sons of Raḥĕl were Yosĕph and Binyamin;

<sup>25</sup> the sons of Bilhah, Raḥĕl’s female servant, were Dan and Naphtali;

<sup>26</sup> and the sons of Zilpah, Lĕ’ah’s female servant, were Gaḏ and Ashĕr. These were the sons of Ya‛aqoḇ who were born to him in Paddan Aram.

<sup>27</sup> And Ya‛aqoḇ came to his father Yitsḥaq at Mamrĕ, or Qiryath Arba, that is Ḥeḇron, where Aḇraham and Yitsḥaq had dwelt.

<sup>28</sup> And the days of Yitsḥaq were one hundred and eighty years.

<sup>29</sup> So Yitsḥaq breathed his last and died, and was gathered to his people, aged and satisfied of days. And his sons Ĕsaw and Ya‛aqoḇ buried him.

<sup>1</sup> And Elohim said to Ya‛aqoḇ, “Arise, go up to Bĕyth Ĕl and dwell there. And make an altar there to Ĕl who appeared to you when you fled from the face of Ĕsaw your brother.”

<sup>2</sup> And Ya‛aqoḇ said to his household and to all who were with him, “Put away the foreign mighty ones that are among you, and cleanse yourselves, and change your garments.
