<sup>1</sup> And when Ya‛aqoḇ saw that there was grain in Mitsrayim, Ya‛aqoḇ said to his sons, “Why do you look at each other?”

<sup>2</sup> And he said, “See, I have heard that there is grain in Mitsrayim. Go down to that place and buy for us there, and let us live and not die.”

<sup>3</sup> And Yosĕph’s ten brothers went down to buy grain in Mitsrayim.

<sup>4</sup> But Ya‛aqoḇ did not send Yosĕph’s brother Binyamin with his brothers, for he said, “Lest some harm come to him.”

<sup>5</sup> And the sons of Yisra’ĕl went to buy grain among those who journeyed, for the scarcity of food was in the land of Kena‛an.

<sup>6</sup> And Yosĕph was the governor over the land, he was the one who sold to all the people of the land. And Yosĕph’s brothers came and bowed down before him with their faces to the earth.

<sup>7</sup> And Yosĕph saw his brothers and recognised them, but he acted as a stranger to them and spoke to them harshly, and said to them, “Where do you come from?” And they said, “From the land of Kena‛an to buy food.”

<sup>8</sup> So Yosĕph recognised his brothers, but they did not recognise him.

<sup>9</sup> And Yosĕph remembered the dreams which he had dreamed about them, and said to them, “You are spies! You have come to see the nakedness of the land!”

<sup>10</sup> And they said to him, “No, my master, but your servants have come to buy food.

<sup>11</sup> “We are all one man’s sons, we are trustworthy, your servants are not spies.”

<sup>12</sup> But he said to them, “No, but you have come to see the nakedness of the land.”

<sup>13</sup> And they said, “Your servants are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Kena‛an. And see, the youngest is with our father today, and one is no more.”

<sup>14</sup> And Yosĕph said to them, “It is as I spoke to you, saying, ‘You are spies!’

<sup>15</sup> “By this you shall be proven: By the life of Pharaoh, you do not leave this place unless your youngest brother comes here.

<sup>16</sup> “Send one of you, and let him bring your brother, while you are kept in prison. So let your words be proven to see whether there is any truth in you, or else, by the life of Pharaoh, you are spies!”

<sup>17</sup> And he put them all together in prison for three days.

<sup>18</sup> Now Yosĕph said to them the third day, “Do this and live, for I fear Elohim:

<sup>19</sup> “If you are trustworthy, let one of your brothers be confined to your prison house, and you, go, bring grain for the scarcity of food of your houses.

<sup>20</sup> “And bring your youngest brother to me, and let your words be confirmed, and you do not die.” And so they did.

<sup>21</sup> And they said to each other, “Truly, we are guilty concerning our brother, for we saw the distress of his life when he pleaded with us, yet we did not listen, that is why this distress has come upon us.”

<sup>22</sup> And Re’uḇĕn answered them, saying, “Did I not speak to you, saying, ‘Do not sin against the boy,’ and you would not listen? And see, his blood is now required of us.”

<sup>23</sup> And they did not know that Yosĕph understood them, for he spoke to them through an interpreter.

<sup>24</sup> And he turned himself away from them and wept, but came back to them and spoke to them. And he took Shim‛on from them and bound him before their eyes.

<sup>25</sup> And Yosĕph commanded and they filled their sacks with grain, also to put back every man’s silver to his sack, and to give them food for the journey. And thus it was done for them.

<sup>26</sup> So they loaded their donkeys with the grain and went from there.

<sup>27</sup> And as one of them opened his sack to give his donkey fodder at the lodging place, he saw his silver, for there it was in the mouth of his sack!

<sup>28</sup> And he said to his brothers, “My silver has been returned, and there it is, in my sack!” And their hearts sank and they were afraid, saying to each other, “What is this that Elohim has done to us?”

<sup>29</sup> So they came to Ya‛aqoḇ their father in the land of Kena‛an and reported to him all that befell them, saying,

<sup>30</sup> “The man, the master of the land, spoke to us harshly, and took us for spies of the land.

<sup>31</sup> “But we said to him, ‘We are trustworthy, we are not spies.

<sup>32</sup> ‘We are twelve brothers, sons of our father. One is no more, and the youngest is today with our father in the land of Kena‛an.’

<sup>33</sup> “And the man, the master of the land, said to us, ‘By this I know that you are trustworthy: Leave one of your brothers here with me, and take food for the scarcity of food of your households, and go.

<sup>34</sup> ‘And bring your youngest brother to me, then I know that you are not spies, but that you are trustworthy – I give your brother to you, and you move about in the land.’ ”

<sup>35</sup> And it came to be as they emptied their sacks, that look, the bundle of each man’s silver was in his sack! And when they and their father saw the bundles of silver, they were afraid.

<sup>36</sup> And Ya‛aqoḇ their father said to them, “You have bereaved me – Yosĕph is no more, and Shim‛on is no more, and you would take Binyamin! All this is against me.”

<sup>37</sup> So Re’uḇĕn spoke to his father, saying, “Take the lives of my two sons if I do not bring him back to you. Put him in my hands, and I myself bring him back to you.”

<sup>38</sup> But he said, “My son is not going down with you, for his brother is dead, and he is left alone. If any harm should come to him along the way in which you go, then you would bring down my grey hair with sorrow to the grave.”
