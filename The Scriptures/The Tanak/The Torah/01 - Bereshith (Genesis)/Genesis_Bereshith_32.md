<sup>1</sup> And Ya‛aqoḇ went on his way, and the messengers of Elohim met him.

<sup>2</sup> And when Ya‛aqoḇ saw them, he said, “This is the camp of Elohim.” And he called the name of that place Maḥanayim.

<sup>3</sup> And Ya‛aqoḇ sent messengers before him to Ĕsaw his brother in the land of Sĕ‛ir, the field of Eḏom

<sup>4</sup> and he commanded them, saying, “Say this to my master Ĕsaw, ‘Your servant Ya‛aqoḇ said this, “I have sojourned with Laḇan and stayed there until now.

<sup>5</sup> “And I have bulls, and donkeys, flocks, and male and female servants. And I have sent to inform my master, to find favour in your eyes.” ’ ”

<sup>6</sup> So the messengers returned to Ya‛aqoḇ, saying, “We came to your brother Ĕsaw, and he also is coming to meet you, and four hundred men with him.”

<sup>7</sup> And Ya‛aqoḇ was greatly afraid and distressed. So he divided the people that were with him, and the flocks and herds and camels, into two groups,

<sup>8</sup> and he said, “If Ĕsaw comes to the one group and attacks it, then the other group which is left shall escape.”

<sup>9</sup> And Ya‛aqoḇ said, “O Elohim of my father Aḇraham and Elohim of my father Yitsḥaq, יהוה who said to me, ‘Return to your land and to your relatives, and I do good to you,’

<sup>10</sup> “I do not deserve the least of all the kind acts and all the truth which You have shown Your servant, for I passed over this Yardĕn with my staff, and now I have become two groups.

<sup>11</sup> “Deliver me, I pray, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Ĕsaw, for I fear him, lest he come and shall smite me and the mother with the children.

<sup>12</sup> “For You said, ‘I shall certainly do good to you, and shall make your seed as the sand of the sea, which are too numerous to count.’ ”

<sup>13</sup> And he spent the night there, and took what came to his hand as a present for Ĕsaw his brother –

<sup>14</sup> two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,

<sup>15</sup> thirty milk camels with their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten foals.

<sup>16</sup> And he gave into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself, and said to his servants, “Pass over before me, and put some distance between drove and drove.”

<sup>17</sup> And he commanded the first one, saying, “When Ĕsaw my brother meets you and asks you, saying, ‘To whom do you belong, and where are you going? And whose are these in front of you?’

<sup>18</sup> then you shall say, ‘They are your servant Ya‛aqoḇ’s. It is a present sent to my master Ĕsaw. And see, he also is behind us.’ ”

<sup>19</sup> So he commanded the second, and the third, and all who followed the droves, saying, “Speak to Ĕsaw this same word when you find him,

<sup>20</sup> and you shall say, ‘Also look, your servant Ya‛aqoḇ is behind us.’ ” For he said, “Let me appease him with the present that goes before me, and after that see his face. He might accept me.”

<sup>21</sup> And the present passed over before him, but he himself spent the night in the camp.

<sup>22</sup> And he rose up that night and took his two wives, and his two female servants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford of Yabboq.

<sup>23</sup> And he took them and sent them over the stream, and sent over what he had.

<sup>24</sup> And Ya‛aqoḇ was left alone. And a Man wrestled with him until the breaking of day.

<sup>25</sup> And when He saw that He did not overcome him, He touched the socket of his hip. And the socket of Ya‛aqoḇ’s hip was dislocated as He wrestled with him.

<sup>26</sup> And He said, “Let Me go, for the day breaks.” But he said, “I am not letting You go until You have blessed me!”

<sup>27</sup> So He asked him, “What is your name?” And he said, “Ya‛aqoḇ.”

<sup>28</sup> And He said, “Your name is no longer called Ya‛aqoḇ, but Yisra’ĕl, because you have striven with Elohim and with men, and have overcome.”

<sup>29</sup> And Ya‛aqoḇ asked Him, saying, “Please let me know Your Name.” And He said, “Why do you ask about My Name?” And He blessed him there.

<sup>30</sup> And Ya‛aqoḇ called the name of the place Peni’ĕl, “For I have seen Elohim face to face, and my life is preserved.”

<sup>31</sup> And the sun rose on him as he passed over Penu’ĕl, and he limped on his hip.

<sup>32</sup> That is why the children of Yisra’ĕl to this day do not eat the sinew of the hip, which is on the socket of the thigh, because He touched the socket of the thigh of Ya‛aqoḇ, in the sinew of the hip.
