<sup>1</sup> And Ya‛aqoḇ called his sons and said, “Gather together, so that I declare to you what is to befall you in the last days:

<sup>2</sup> “Gather together and hear, you sons of Ya‛aqoḇ, and listen to Yisra’ĕl your father.

<sup>3</sup> “Re’uḇĕn, you are my first-born, my power and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of exaltation and the excellency of power.

<sup>4</sup> “Boiling like water, you do not excel, because you went up to your father’s bed, then you defiled it – he went up to my couch.

<sup>5</sup> “Shim‛on and Lĕwi are brothers, their weapons are implements of violence.

<sup>6</sup> “Let my being not enter their council, let my esteem not be united to their assembly; because they slew a man in their displeasure, and they lamed an ox in pleasure.

<sup>7</sup> “Cursed be their displeasure for it is fierce, and their wrath for it is cruel! I divide them in Ya‛aqoḇ and scatter them in Yisra’ĕl.

<sup>8</sup> “You, Yehuḏah, your brothers praise you; your hand is on the neck of your enemies; your father’s children bow down before you.

<sup>9</sup> “Yehuḏah is a lion’s cub; from the prey you have gone up, my son! He bowed down, he crouched like a lion. And like a lion, who does rouse him?

<sup>10</sup> “The sceptre shall not turn aside from Yehuḏah, nor a Lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh comes, and to Him is the obedience of peoples.

<sup>11</sup> “Binding his donkey to the vine, and his donkey’s colt to the choice vine, he washed his garments in wine, and his robes in the blood of grapes.

<sup>12</sup> “His eyes are darker than wine, and his teeth whiter than milk.

<sup>13</sup> “Zeḇulun dwells at the seashore, he is for a haven for ships, and his border is unto Tsiḏon.

<sup>14</sup> “Yissasḵar is a strong donkey lying down between two burdens,

<sup>15</sup> and he saw that a resting place was good, and that the land was pleasant, and he inclined his shoulder to bear a burden, and became a subject to slave labour.

<sup>16</sup> “Dan rightly rules his people as one of the tribes of Yisra’ĕl.

<sup>17</sup> “Dan is a serpent by the way, an adder by the path, that bites the horse’s heels so that its rider falls backward.

<sup>18</sup> “I have waited for your deliverance, O יהוה !

<sup>19</sup> “Gaḏ, a raiding band raids him, but he raids its heel.

<sup>20</sup> “Bread from Ashĕr is rich, and he gives delicacies of a sovereign.

<sup>21</sup> “Naphtali is a deer let loose, he gives words of elegance.

<sup>22</sup> “Yosĕph is an offshoot of a fruit-bearing tree, an offshoot of a fruit-bearing tree by a fountain, his branches run over a wall.

<sup>23</sup> “And the archers have bitterly grieved him, shot at him and hated him.

<sup>24</sup> “But his bow remained in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the Mighty One of Ya‛aqoḇ – from there is the Shepherd, the Stone of Yisra’ĕl –

<sup>25</sup> from the Ĕl of your father who helps you, and by the Almighty who blesses you with blessings of the heavens above, blessings of the deep that lies beneath, blessings of the breasts and of the womb.

<sup>26</sup> “The blessings of your father have excelled the blessings of my ancestors, up to the limit of the everlasting hills. They are on the head of Yosĕph, and on the crown of the head of him who was separated from his brothers.

<sup>27</sup> “Binyamin is a wolf that tears, in the morning he eats prey, and at night he divides the spoil.”

<sup>28</sup> All these are the twelve tribes of Yisra’ĕl, and this is what their father spoke to them. And he blessed them, he blessed each one according to his own blessing.

<sup>29</sup> And he commanded them, and said to them, “I am to be gathered to my people, bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Ḥittite,

<sup>30</sup> in the cave that is in the field of Maḵpĕlah, which is before Mamrĕ in the land of Kena‛an, which Aḇraham bought with the field of Ephron the Ḥittite as a possession for a burial site.

<sup>31</sup> There they buried Aḇraham and Sarah his wife, there they buried Yitsḥaq and Riḇqah his wife, and there I buried Lĕ’ah –

<sup>32</sup> the field purchased, and the cave which is in it, from the sons of Ḥĕth.”

<sup>33</sup> And when Ya‛aqoḇ ended commanding his sons, he drew his feet up into the bed and breathed his last, and was gathered to his people.
