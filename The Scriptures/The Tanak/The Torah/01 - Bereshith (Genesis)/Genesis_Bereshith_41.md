<sup>1</sup> And it came to be, at the end of two years’ time, that Pharaoh had a dream, and saw him standing by the river,

<sup>2</sup> and saw seven cows coming up out of the river, fine looking and fat, and they fed amongst the reeds,

<sup>3</sup> then saw seven other cows coming up after them out of the river, ugly and lean of flesh, and stood by the other cows on the bank of the river.

<sup>4</sup> And the ugly and lean of flesh cows ate up the seven fine looking and fat cows. Then Pharaoh awoke.

<sup>5</sup> And he slept and dreamed a second time and saw seven heads of grain coming up on one stalk, plump and good,

<sup>6</sup> and saw seven lean heads, scorched by the east wind, coming up after them.

<sup>7</sup> And the seven lean heads swallowed the seven plump and complete heads. Then Pharaoh awoke and saw it was a dream.

<sup>8</sup> And it came to be in the morning that his spirit was moved, and he sent and called for all the magicians of Mitsrayim and all its wise men. And Pharaoh related to them his dreams, but there was no one who could interpret them for Pharaoh.

<sup>9</sup> Then the chief cupbearer spoke to Pharaoh, saying, “I remember my crimes this day.

<sup>10</sup> “When Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in confinement in the house of the captain of the guard, both me and the chief baker,

<sup>11</sup> each one of us dreamed a dream in one night, he and I. Each of us dreamed according to the interpretation of his own dream.

<sup>12</sup> “And there was with us a Heḇrew youth, a servant of the captain of the guard. And we related to him, and he interpreted our dreams for us. To each man he interpreted according to his own dream.

<sup>13</sup> “And it came to be, as he interpreted for us, so it came to be. He restored me to my office, and he hanged him.”

<sup>14</sup> Then Pharaoh sent and called Yosĕph, and they hurriedly brought him out of the dungeon. And he shaved and changed his garments, and came to Pharaoh.

<sup>15</sup> And Pharaoh said to Yosĕph, “I have dreamed a dream, and there is no one to interpret it. Now I myself have heard it said of you that you understand a dream, to interpret it.”

<sup>16</sup> And Yosĕph answered Pharaoh, saying, “It is not in me, let Elohim answer Pharaoh with peace.”

<sup>17</sup> And Pharaoh said to Yosĕph, “See, in my dream I stood on the bank of the river

<sup>18</sup> and saw seven cows coming up out of the river, fine looking and fat, and they fed amongst the reeds,

<sup>19</sup> then saw seven other cows coming up after them, poor and very ugly and lean of flesh, such ugliness as I have never seen in all the land of Mitsrayim.

<sup>20</sup> “And the lean of flesh and ugly cows ate up the first seven, the fat cows.

<sup>21</sup> “Yet when they had eaten them up, no one would have known that they had eaten them, for they were as ugly as at the beginning. Then I awoke.

<sup>22</sup> “Also, I looked in my dream and saw seven heads coming up on one stalk, complete and good,

<sup>23</sup> then saw seven heads, withered, lean, scorched by the east wind, coming up after them.

<sup>24</sup> “And the lean heads swallowed the seven good heads. And I spoke to the magicians, but there was no one who could explain it to me.”

<sup>25</sup> And Yosĕph said to Pharaoh, “The dream of Pharaoh is one. Elohim has shown Pharaoh what He is about to do:

<sup>26</sup> “The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good heads are seven years – it is one dream.

<sup>27</sup> “And the seven lean and ugly cows which came up after them are seven years, and the seven empty heads scorched by the east wind are seven years of scarcity of food.

<sup>28</sup> “This is the word which I spoke to Pharaoh: Elohim has shown Pharaoh what He is about to do.

<sup>29</sup> “See, seven years of great plenty are coming in all the land of Mitsrayim,

<sup>30</sup> but after them seven years of scarcity of food shall arise and all the plenty be forgotten in the land of Mitsrayim. And the scarcity of food shall destroy the land,

<sup>31</sup> and the plenty shall not be remembered in the land, because of the scarcity of food following, for it is very severe.

<sup>32</sup> “And the dream was repeated to Pharaoh twice because the word is established by Elohim, and Elohim is hastening to do it.

<sup>33</sup> “And now, let Pharaoh look for a discerning and wise man, and set him over the land of Mitsrayim.

<sup>34</sup> “Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint overseers over the land, to take up one-fifth of the land of Mitsrayim in the seven years of plenty.

<sup>35</sup> “And let them gather all the food of those good years that are coming, and store up grain under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities.

<sup>36</sup> “And the food shall be for a store for the land for the seven years of scarcity of food which shall be in the land of Mitsrayim, and do not let the land be cut off by the scarcity of food.”

<sup>37</sup> And the word was good in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of all his servants.

<sup>38</sup> And Pharaoh said to his servants, “Could we find another like him, a man in whom is the Spirit of Elohim?”

<sup>39</sup> Then Pharaoh said to Yosĕph, “Since Elohim has shown you all this, there is no one as discerning and wise as you.

<sup>40</sup> “Be over my house, you yourself, and at your mouth all my people shall kiss – only in the throne I am greater than you.”

<sup>41</sup> And Pharaoh said to Yosĕph, “See, I have set you over all the land of Mitsrayim.”

<sup>42</sup> And Pharaoh took his seal-ring off his hand and put it on Yosĕph’s hand. And he dressed him in garments of fine linen and put a gold chain around his neck.

<sup>43</sup> And he had him ride in the second chariot which he had. And they cried out before him, “Bow the knee!” And he set him over all the land of Mitsrayim.

<sup>44</sup> And Pharaoh said to Yosĕph, “I am Pharaoh, and without a word from you let no man lift his hand or foot in all the land of Mitsrayim.”

<sup>45</sup> And Pharaoh called Yosĕph’s name Zaphnath-Pa‛nĕaḥ. And he gave him as a wife Asenath, the daughter of Poti-Pherah priest of On. And Yosĕph went out over all the land of Mitsrayim.

<sup>46</sup> Now Yosĕph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh sovereign of Mitsrayim. And Yosĕph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Mitsrayim.

<sup>47</sup> And in the seven years of plenty the ground brought forth generously.

<sup>48</sup> And he gathered all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Mitsrayim, and laid up the food in the cities. He laid up in every city the food of the fields which surrounded them.

<sup>49</sup> Thus Yosĕph gathered very much grain, as the sand of the sea, until he ceased counting, for it was without number.

<sup>50</sup> And to Yosĕph were born two sons before the years of scarcity of food came, whom Asenath, the daughter of Poti-Pherah priest of On, bore to him.

<sup>51</sup> And Yosĕph called the name of the first-born Menashsheh, “For Elohim has made me forget all my toil and all my father’s house.”

<sup>52</sup> And the name of the second he called Ephrayim, “For Elohim has caused me to bear fruit in the land of my affliction.”

<sup>53</sup> And the seven years of plenty which were in the land of Mitsrayim came to an end,

<sup>54</sup> and the seven years of scarcity of food began to come, as Yosĕph had said. And the scarcity of food was in all lands, but in all the land of Mitsrayim there was bread.

<sup>55</sup> But when all the land of Mitsrayim hungered, and the people cried to Pharaoh for bread, Pharaoh said to all the Mitsrites, “Go to Yosĕph, do whatever he says to you.”

<sup>56</sup> And the scarcity of food was over all the face of the earth, and Yosĕph opened all the storehouses and sold to the Mitsrites. And the scarcity of food was severe in the land of Mitsrayim.

<sup>57</sup> And all the earth came to Yosĕph in Mitsrayim to buy grain, because the scarcity of food was severe in all the earth.
