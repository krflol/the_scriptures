<sup>1</sup> And there was a scarcity of food in the land, besides the first scarcity of food which was in the days of Aḇraham. And Yitsḥaq went to Aḇimeleḵ, sovereign of the Philistines, in Gerar.

<sup>2</sup> And יהוה appeared to him and said, “Do not go down to Mitsrayim, live in the land which I command you.

<sup>3</sup> “Sojourn in this land. And I shall be with you and bless you, for I give all these lands to you and your seed. And I shall establish the oath which I swore to Aḇraham your father.

<sup>4</sup> “And I shall increase your seed like the stars of the heavens, and I shall give all these lands to your seed. And in your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed,

<sup>5</sup> because Aḇraham obeyed My voice and guarded My Charge: My commands, My laws, and My Torot.”

<sup>6</sup> And Yitsḥaq dwelt in Gerar.

<sup>7</sup> And when the men of the place asked about his wife, he said, “She is my sister.” For he was afraid to say, “She is my wife,” thinking, “lest the men of the place should kill me for Riḇqah, because she is good-looking.”

<sup>8</sup> And it came to be, when he had been there a long time, that Aḇimeleḵ sovereign of the Philistines looked through a window, and he watched and saw Yitsḥaq playing with Riḇqah his wife.

<sup>9</sup> So Aḇimeleḵ called Yitsḥaq and said, “See, truly she is your wife! So how could you say, ‘She is my sister’?” And Yitsḥaq said to him, “Because I said, ‘Lest I die on account of her.’ ”

<sup>10</sup> And Aḇimeleḵ said, “What is this you have done to us? One of the people had almost lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt on us.”

<sup>11</sup> And Aḇimeleḵ commanded all his people, saying, “He who touches this man or his wife shall certainly be put to death.”

<sup>12</sup> And Yitsḥaq sowed in that land, and reaped in the same year a hundredfold, and יהוה blessed him.

<sup>13</sup> And the man grew great and went forward until he became very great.

<sup>14</sup> And he came to have possessions of flocks and possessions of herds and a great body of servants, and the Philistines envied him.

<sup>15</sup> And the Philistines had stopped up all the wells which his father’s servants had dug in the days of Aḇraham his father, and filled them with dirt.

<sup>16</sup> And Aḇimeleḵ said to Yitsḥaq, “Go away from us, for you are much mightier than we.”

<sup>17</sup> So Yitsḥaq went from there and pitched his tent in the wadi Gerar, and dwelt there.

<sup>18</sup> And Yitsḥaq dug again the wells of water which they had dug in the days of Aḇraham his father, for the Philistines had stopped them up after the death of Aḇraham. And he called them by the names which his father had called them.

<sup>19</sup> But when Yitsḥaq’s servants dug in the wadi and found a well of running water there,

<sup>20</sup> the herdsmen of Gerar strove with Yitsḥaq’s herdsmen, saying, “The water is ours.” And he called the name of the well Ĕseq, because they strove with him.

<sup>21</sup> And they dug another well, and they strove over that one too, and he called its name Sitnah.

<sup>22</sup> And he moved from there and dug another well, and they did not strive over it. And he called its name Reḥoḇoth, and said, “For now יהוה has made room for us, and we shall bear fruit in the land.”

<sup>23</sup> And from there he went up to Be’ĕrsheḇa.

<sup>24</sup> And יהוה appeared to him the same night and said, “I am the Elohim of your father Aḇraham. Do not fear, for I am with you, and shall bless you and increase your seed for My servant Aḇraham’s sake.”

<sup>25</sup> And he built an altar there, and called on the Name of יהוה, and he pitched his tent there, and the servants of Yitsḥaq dug a well there.

<sup>26</sup> And Aḇimeleḵ came to him from Gerar, with Aḥuzzath, one of his friends, and Piḵol the commander of his army.

<sup>27</sup> And Yitsḥaq said to them, “Why have you come to me, seeing you have hated me and have sent me away from you?”

<sup>28</sup> But they said, “We have clearly seen that יהוה is with you. And we said, ‘Please, let there be an oath between us, between you and us. And let us make a covenant with you,

<sup>29</sup> that you do no evil to us, as we have not touched you, and as we have done only good toward you, and have sent you away in peace. You are now blessed by יהוה.’ ”

<sup>30</sup> And he made them a feast, and they ate and drank.

<sup>31</sup> And they rose early in the morning and swore an oath with one another. And Yitsḥaq let them go, and they departed from him in peace.

<sup>32</sup> And on the same day it came to be that the servants of Yitsḥaq came and informed him about the well which they had dug, and said to him, “We have found water.”

<sup>33</sup> So he called it Shiḇah. Therefore the name of the city is Be’ĕrsheḇa to this day.

<sup>34</sup> And when Ĕsaw was forty years old, he took as wives Yehuḏith the daughter of Be’ĕri the Ḥittite, and Basemath the daughter of Ĕlon the Ḥittite.

<sup>35</sup> And they were a bitterness of spirit to Yitsḥaq and Riḇqah.

<sup>1</sup> And there was a scarcity of food in the land, besides the first scarcity of food which was in the days of Aḇraham. And Yitsḥaq went to Aḇimeleḵ, sovereign of the Philistines, in Gerar.

<sup>6</sup> And Yitsḥaq dwelt in Gerar.

<sup>7</sup> And when the men of the place asked about his wife, he said, “She is my sister.” For he was afraid to say, “She is my wife,” thinking, “lest the men of the place should kill me for Riḇqah, because she is good-looking.”
