<sup>1</sup> And Ya‛aqoḇ moved on and came to the land of the people of the East.

<sup>2</sup> And he looked and saw a well in the field, and saw three flocks of sheep lying by it, for out of that well they watered the flocks, and a large stone was on the well’s mouth.

<sup>3</sup> And all the flocks would be gathered there, then they would roll the stone from the well’s mouth and water the sheep, and put the stone back in its place on the well’s mouth.

<sup>4</sup> So Ya‛aqoḇ said to them, “My brothers, where are you from?” And they said, “We are from Ḥaran.”

<sup>5</sup> And he said to them, “Do you know Laḇan son of Naḥor?” And they said, “We know him.”

<sup>6</sup> So he said to them, “Is he well?” And they said, “Well. And see, his daughter Raḥĕl is coming with the sheep.”

<sup>7</sup> And he said, “See, it is still high day, not the time for the livestock to be gathered together. Water the sheep, and go and feed them.”

<sup>8</sup> But they said, “We are not allowed until all the flocks are gathered together, and they have rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, then we shall water the sheep.”

<sup>9</sup> While he was still speaking with them, Raḥĕl came with her father’s sheep, for she was a shepherdess.

<sup>10</sup> And it came to be, when Ya‛aqoḇ saw Raḥĕl the daughter of Laḇan his mother’s brother, and the sheep of Laḇan his mother’s brother, that Ya‛aqoḇ went near and rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and watered the flock of Laḇan his mother’s brother.

<sup>11</sup> And Ya‛aqoḇ kissed Raḥĕl, and lifted up his voice and wept.

<sup>12</sup> And when Ya‛aqoḇ told Raḥĕl that he was her father’s relative and that he was Riḇqah’s son, she ran and told her father.

<sup>13</sup> And it came to be, when Laḇan heard the report about Ya‛aqoḇ his sister’s son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him and kissed him, and brought him to his house. Then he told Laḇan all these matters.

<sup>14</sup> And Laḇan said to him, “You are indeed my bone and my flesh.” And he stayed with him for a month.

<sup>15</sup> Then Laḇan said to Ya‛aqoḇ, “Because you are my relative, should you therefore serve me for naught? Let me know, what should your wages be?”

<sup>16</sup> And Laḇan had two daughters, the name of the elder was Lĕ’ah, and the name of the younger was Raḥĕl.

<sup>17</sup> And Lĕ’ah’s eyes were weak, but Raḥĕl was lovely of form and appearance.

<sup>18</sup> And Ya‛aqoḇ loved Raḥĕl, so he said, “Let me serve you seven years for Raḥĕl your younger daughter.”

<sup>19</sup> And Laḇan said, “It is better that I give her to you than that I should give her to another man. Stay with me.”

<sup>20</sup> So Ya‛aqoḇ served seven years for Raḥĕl, and they seemed to him but a few days because of the love he had for her.

<sup>21</sup> Then Ya‛aqoḇ said to Laḇan, “Give me my wife, for my days are completed, and let me go in to her.”

<sup>22</sup> And Laḇan gathered all the men of the place and made a feast.

<sup>23</sup> And it came to be in the evening, that he took Lĕ’ah his daughter and brought her to Ya‛aqoḇ. And he went in to her.

<sup>24</sup> And Laḇan gave his female servant Zilpah to his daughter Lĕ’ah as a female servant.

<sup>25</sup> And in the morning it came to be, that see, it was Lĕ’ah. So he said to Laḇan, “What is this you have done to me? Was it not for Raḥĕl that I served you? Why then have you deceived me?”

<sup>26</sup> And Laḇan said, “It is not done this way in our place, to give the younger before the first-born.

<sup>27</sup> “Complete the week of this one, then we give you this one too, for the service which you shall serve with me still another seven years.”

<sup>28</sup> And Ya‛aqoḇ did so and completed her week. Then he gave him his daughter Raḥĕl too, as wife.

<sup>29</sup> And Laḇan gave his female servant Bilhah to his daughter Raḥĕl as a female servant.

<sup>30</sup> And he also went in to Raḥĕl, and he also loved Raḥĕl more than Lĕ’ah. And he served with Laḇan still another seven years.

<sup>31</sup> And יהוה saw that Lĕ’ah was unloved, and He opened her womb, but Raḥĕl was barren.

<sup>32</sup> And Lĕ’ah conceived and bore a son, and she called his name Re’uḇĕn, for she said, “For יהוה has looked on my affliction, because now my husband is going to love me.”

<sup>33</sup> And she conceived again and bore a son, and said, “Because יהוה has heard that I am unloved, He gave me this son too.” And she called his name Shim‛on.

<sup>34</sup> And she conceived again and bore a son, and said, “Now this time my husband is joined to me, because I have borne him three sons.” So his name was called Lĕwi.

<sup>35</sup> And she conceived again and bore a son, and said, “Now I praise יהוה.” So she called his name Yehuḏah. And she ceased bearing.

<sup>1</sup> And Ya‛aqoḇ moved on and came to the land of the people of the East.

<sup>11</sup> And Ya‛aqoḇ kissed Raḥĕl, and lifted up his voice and wept.
