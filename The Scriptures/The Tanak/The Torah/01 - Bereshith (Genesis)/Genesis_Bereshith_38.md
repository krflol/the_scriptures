<sup>1</sup> And at that time it came to be that Yehuḏah left his brothers, and turned aside to a man, an Aḏullamite whose name was Ḥirah.

<sup>2</sup> And Yehuḏah saw there a daughter of a certain Kena‛anite whose name was Shuwa. And he took her and went in to her.

<sup>3</sup> So she conceived and bore a son, and he called his name Ĕr.

<sup>4</sup> And she conceived again and bore a son, and she called his name Onan.

<sup>5</sup> And she conceived yet again and bore a son, and called his name Shĕlah. And he was at Keziḇ when she bore him.

<sup>6</sup> And Yehuḏah took a wife for Ĕr his first-born, and her name was Tamar.

<sup>7</sup> But Ĕr, Yehuḏah’s first-born, was evil in the eyes of יהוה, and יהוה took his life.

<sup>8</sup> And Yehuḏah said to Onan, “Go in to your brother’s wife and marry her, and raise up an heir to your brother.”

<sup>9</sup> And Onan knew that the offspring would not be his. And it came to be, when he went in to his brother’s wife, that he spilled on the ground, lest he should give an offspring to his brother.

<sup>10</sup> But what he did displeased יהוה, so He took his life too.

<sup>11</sup> Then Yehuḏah said to Tamar his daughter-in-law, “Remain a widow in your father’s house until my son Shĕlah is grown.” For he said, “Lest he also die as his brothers did.” And Tamar went and dwelt in her father’s house.

<sup>12</sup> And after a long time the daughter of Shuwa, Yehuḏah’s wife, died. And Yehuḏah was comforted, and went up to his sheep-shearers at Timnah, he and his friend Ḥirah the Aḏullamite.

<sup>13</sup> And it was reported to Tamar, saying, “See, your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep.”

<sup>14</sup> And she took off her widow’s garments, and covered herself with a veil and wrapped herself, and sat at the entrance to Ĕnayim which was on the way to Timnah. For she saw that Shĕlah was grown, and she was not given to him as a wife.

<sup>15</sup> And Yehuḏah saw her, and reckoned her for a whore, for she had covered her face.

<sup>16</sup> And he turned aside to her by the way, and said, “Please let me come in to you,” for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. And she said, “What do you give me to come in to me?”

<sup>17</sup> And he said, “Let me send you a young goat from the flock.” And she said, “Do you give me a pledge until you send it?”

<sup>18</sup> So he said, “What pledge should I give you?” And she said, “Your seal and your cord and your staff that is in your hand.” And he gave them to her, and went in to her, and she conceived by him.

<sup>19</sup> And she arose and went away, and removed her veil and put on the garments of her widowhood.

<sup>20</sup> And Yehuḏah sent the young goat by the hand of his friend the Aḏullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman’s hand, but he did not find her.

<sup>21</sup> And he asked the men of that place, saying, “Where is the cult prostitute who was beside the way to Ĕnayim?” And they said, “There was no cult prostitute in this place.”

<sup>22</sup> And he returned to Yehuḏah and said, “I have not found her. And the men of the place also said there was no cult prostitute in this place.”

<sup>23</sup> And Yehuḏah said, “Let her take them for herself, lest we become despised, for I sent this young goat and you have not found her.”

<sup>24</sup> And it came to be, about three months after, that Yehuḏah was informed, saying, “Tamar your daughter-in-law has whored, and see, she has conceived by whoring.” And Yehuḏah said, “Bring her out and let her be burned!”

<sup>25</sup> When she was brought out, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, “By the man to whom these belong, I am pregnant.” And she said, “Please examine whose these are: the seal and the cord and the staff.”

<sup>26</sup> And Yehuḏah examined and said, “She has been more righteous than I, because I did not give her to Shĕlah my son.” And he never knew her again.

<sup>27</sup> And it came to be, at the time for giving birth, that see, twins were in her womb.

<sup>28</sup> And it came to be, when she was giving birth, that the one put out his hand. And the midwife took a scarlet thread and bound it on his hand, saying, “This one came out first.”

<sup>29</sup> And it came to be, as he drew back his hand, that see, his brother came out! And she said, “How did you break through? This breach be upon you!” So his name was called Perets.

<sup>30</sup> And afterward his brother came out who had the scarlet thread on his hand. So his name was called Zeraḥ.

<sup>1</sup> And at that time it came to be that Yehuḏah left his brothers, and turned aside to a man, an Aḏullamite whose name was Ḥirah.

<sup>2</sup> And Yehuḏah saw there a daughter of a certain Kena‛anite whose name was Shuwa. And he took her and went in to her.

<sup>3</sup> So she conceived and bore a son, and he called his name Ĕr.

<sup>4</sup> And she conceived again and bore a son, and she called his name Onan.

<sup>5</sup> And she conceived yet again and bore a son, and called his name Shĕlah. And he was at Keziḇ when she bore him.

<sup>6</sup> And Yehuḏah took a wife for Ĕr his first-born, and her name was Tamar.

<sup>7</sup> But Ĕr, Yehuḏah’s first-born, was evil in the eyes of יהוה, and יהוה took his life.

<sup>8</sup> And Yehuḏah said to Onan, “Go in to your brother’s wife and marry her, and raise up an heir to your brother.”

<sup>9</sup> And Onan knew that the offspring would not be his. And it came to be, when he went in to his brother’s wife, that he spilled on the ground, lest he should give an offspring to his brother.
