<sup>1</sup> And Aḏam knew Ḥawwah his wife, and she conceived and bore Qayin, and said, “I have gained a man from יהוה.”

<sup>2</sup> And again, she gave birth to his brother Heḇel. And Heḇel became a keeper of sheep, but Qayin became a tiller of the ground.

<sup>3</sup> And it came to be, in the course of time, that Qayin brought an offering of the fruit of the ground to יהוה.

<sup>4</sup> And Heḇel also brought of the first-born of his flock and of their fat. And יהוה looked to Heḇel and his offering,

<sup>5</sup> but He did not look to Qayin and his offering. And Qayin was very wroth, and his face fell.

<sup>6</sup> And יהוה said to Qayin, “Why are you wroth? And why is your face fallen?

<sup>7</sup> “If you do well, is there not acceptance? And if you do not do well, sin is crouching at the door. And its desire is for you, but you should master it.”

<sup>8</sup> And Qayin told Heḇel his brother. And it came to be when they were in the field, that Qayin rose up against Heḇel his brother and killed him.

<sup>9</sup> And יהוה said to Qayin, “Where is Heḇel your brother?” And he said, “I do not know. Am I my brother’s guard?”

<sup>10</sup> And He said, “What have you done? The voice of your brother’s blood cries out to Me from the ground.

<sup>11</sup> “And now you are cursed from the earth, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand.

<sup>12</sup> “If you till the ground, it shall no longer yield its strength to you. You shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth.”

<sup>13</sup> And Qayin said to יהוה, “My punishment is too great to bear!

<sup>14</sup> “See, You have driven me from the face of the ground today, and I am hidden from Your face. I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth, and it shall be that anyone who finds me kills me.”

<sup>15</sup> And יהוה said to him, “Well, if anyone kills Qayin, vengeance is taken on him sevenfold.” And יהוה set up a sign for Qayin, lest anyone finding him kills him.

<sup>16</sup> So Qayin went out from the presence of יהוה and dwelt in the land of Noḏ on the east of Ĕḏen.

<sup>17</sup> And Qayin knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Ḥanoḵ. And he built a city, and called the name of the city after the name of his son, Ḥanoḵ.

<sup>18</sup> And to Ḥanoḵ was born Iraḏ. And Iraḏ brought forth Meḥuya’ĕl, and Meḥuya’ĕl brought forth Methusa’ĕl, and Methusa’ĕl brought forth Lemeḵ.

<sup>19</sup> And Lemeḵ took for himself two wives, the name of one was Aḏah, and the name of the second was Tsillah.

<sup>20</sup> And Aḏah bore Yaḇal. He was the father of those who dwell in tents, with livestock.

<sup>21</sup> And his brother’s name was Yuḇal. He was the father of all those who play the lyre and flute.

<sup>22</sup> As for Tsillah, she also bore Tuḇal-Qayin, a smith of all kinds of tools in bronze and iron. And the sister of Tuḇal-Qayin was Na‛amah.

<sup>23</sup> And Lemeḵ said to his wives, “Aḏah and Tsillah, hear my voice! Wives of Lemeḵ, listen to my words! For I have killed a man for wounding me, even a young man for hurting me.

<sup>24</sup> “For Qayin is avenged sevenfold, and Lemeḵ seventy-sevenfold.”

<sup>25</sup> And Aḏam knew his wife again, and she bore a son and called his name Shĕth, “For Elohim has appointed me another seed instead of Heḇel, because Qayin had slain him.”

<sup>26</sup> And to Shĕth, to him also a son was born. And he called his name Enosh. Then it was begun to call on the Name of יהוה.
