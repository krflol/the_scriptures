<sup>1</sup> And Aḇram went up from Mitsrayim into the South, he and his wife and all that he had, and Lot with him.

<sup>2</sup> And Aḇram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold.

<sup>3</sup> And he went on his journey from the South as far as Bĕyth Ĕl, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bĕyth Ĕl and Ai,

<sup>4</sup> to the place of the altar which he had made there at first. And there Aḇram called on the Name of יהוה.

<sup>5</sup> Now Lot, who went with Aḇram, also had flocks and herds and tents.

<sup>6</sup> And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together, for their possessions were great, so that they could not dwell together.

<sup>7</sup> And there was strife between the herdsmen of Aḇram’s livestock and the herdsmen of Lot’s livestock. And at that time the Kena‛anites and the Perizzites dwelt in the land.

<sup>8</sup> Then Aḇram said to Lot, “Please let there be no strife between you and me, and between my herdsmen and your herdsmen, for we are brothers.

<sup>9</sup> “Is not all the land before you? Please separate from me. If you take the left, then I go to the right; or, if you go to the right, then I go to the left.”

<sup>10</sup> And Lot lifted his eyes and saw all the plain of the Yardĕn, that it was well watered everywhere – before יהוה destroyed Seḏom and Amorah – like the garden of יהוה, like the land of Mitsrayim as you go toward Tso‛ar.

<sup>11</sup> So Lot chose for himself all the plain of the Yardĕn, and Lot moved east. Thus they separated from each other,

<sup>12</sup> Aḇram dwelling in the land of Kena‛an, and Lot dwelling in the cities of the plain and pitched his tent as far as Seḏom.

<sup>13</sup> But the men of Seḏom were evil and sinned before יהוה, exceedingly so.

<sup>14</sup> And after Lot had separated from him, יהוה said to Aḇram, “Now lift up your eyes and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward,

<sup>15</sup> for all the land which you see I shall give to you and your seed forever.

<sup>16</sup> “And I shall make your seed as the dust of the earth, so that, if a man could count the dust of the earth, then your seed also could be counted.

<sup>17</sup> “Arise, walk in the land through its length and its width, for I give it to you.”

<sup>18</sup> So Aḇram moved his tent, and went and dwelt by the terebinth trees of Mamrĕ, which are in Ḥeḇron, and built an altar there to יהוה.

<sup>1</sup> And Aḇram went up from Mitsrayim into the South, he and his wife and all that he had, and Lot with him.

<sup>2</sup> And Aḇram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold.

<sup>3</sup> And he went on his journey from the South as far as Bĕyth Ĕl, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bĕyth Ĕl and Ai,

<sup>7</sup> And there was strife between the herdsmen of Aḇram’s livestock and the herdsmen of Lot’s livestock. And at that time the Kena‛anites and the Perizzites dwelt in the land.

<sup>8</sup> Then Aḇram said to Lot, “Please let there be no strife between you and me, and between my herdsmen and your herdsmen, for we are brothers.

<sup>9</sup> “Is not all the land before you? Please separate from me. If you take the left, then I go to the right; or, if you go to the right, then I go to the left.”

<sup>10</sup> And Lot lifted his eyes and saw all the plain of the Yardĕn, that it was well watered everywhere – before יהוה destroyed Seḏom and Amorah – like the garden of יהוה, like the land of Mitsrayim as you go toward Tso‛ar.

<sup>11</sup> So Lot chose for himself all the plain of the Yardĕn, and Lot moved east. Thus they separated from each other,
