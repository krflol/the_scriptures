<sup>1</sup> And this is the genealogy of the sons of Noaḥ: Shĕm, Ḥam, and Yepheth. And sons were born to them after the flood.

<sup>2</sup> The sons of Yepheth: Gomer, and Maḡoḡ, and Maḏai, and Yawan, and Tuḇal, and Mesheḵ, and Tiras.

<sup>3</sup> And the sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Toḡarmah.

<sup>4</sup> And the sons of Yawan: Elishah and Tarshish, Kittim and Doḏanim.

<sup>5</sup> From these the coastland peoples of the nations were separated into their lands, everyone according to his language, according to their clans, into their nations.

<sup>6</sup> And the sons of Ḥam: Kush, and Mitsrayim, and Put, and Kena‛an.

<sup>7</sup> And the sons of Kush: Seḇa, and Ḥawilah, and Saḇtah, and Ra‛mah, and Saḇteḵa. And the sons of Ra‛mah: Sheḇa and Deḏan.

<sup>8</sup> And Kush brought forth Nimroḏ, he began to be a mighty one on the earth.

<sup>9</sup> He was a mighty hunter before יהוה, therefore it is said, “Like Nimroḏ the mighty hunter before יהוה.”

<sup>10</sup> And the beginning of his reign was Baḇel, and Ereḵ, and Akkaḏ, and Kalnĕh, in the land of Shin‛ar.

<sup>11</sup> From that land he went to Ashshur and built Ninewĕh, and Reḥoḇoth Ir, and Kelaḥ,

<sup>12</sup> and Resen between Ninewĕh and Kelaḥ, the great city.

<sup>13</sup> And Mitsrayim brought forth Luḏim, and Anamim, and Lehaḇim, and Naphtuḥim,

<sup>14</sup> and Pathrusim, and Kasluḥim, from whom came the Philistines and Kaphtorim.

<sup>15</sup> And Kena‛an brought forth Tsiḏon his first-born, and Ḥĕth,

<sup>16</sup> and the Yeḇusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgashite,

<sup>17</sup> and the Ḥiwwite, and the Arqite, and the Sinite,

<sup>18</sup> and the Arwaḏite, and the Tsemarite, and the Ḥamathite. And afterward the clans of the Kena‛anites were spread abroad.

<sup>19</sup> And the border of the Kena‛anites was from Tsiḏon as you go toward Gerar, as far as Azzah, as you go toward Seḏom, and Amorah, and Aḏmah, and Tseḇoyim, as far as Lasha.

<sup>20</sup> These were the sons of Ḥam, according to their clans, according to their languages, in their lands, in their nations.

<sup>21</sup> And also to Shĕm, the father of all the children of Ĕḇer, the brother of Yepheth the elder, children were born.

<sup>22</sup> The sons of Shĕm: Ĕylam, and Asshur, and Arpaḵshaḏ, and Luḏ, and Aram.

<sup>23</sup> And the sons of Aram: Uts, and Ḥul, and Gether, and Mash.

<sup>24</sup> And Arpaḵshaḏ brought forth Shelaḥ, and Shelaḥ brought forth Ĕḇer.

<sup>25</sup> And to Ĕḇer were born two sons, the name of one was Peleḡ, for in his days the earth was divided, and his brother’s name was Yoqtan.

<sup>26</sup> And Yoqtan brought forth Almoḏaḏ, and Sheleph, and Ḥatsarmaweth, and Yeraḥ,

<sup>27</sup> and Haḏoram, and Uzal, and Diqlah,

<sup>28</sup> and Oḇal, and Aḇima’ĕl, and Sheḇa,

<sup>29</sup> and Ophir, and Ḥawilah, and Yoḇaḇ. All these were sons of Yoqtan.

<sup>30</sup> And their dwelling place was from Mĕysha as you go toward Sephar, a mountain of the east.

<sup>31</sup> These were the sons of Shĕm, according to their clans, according to their languages, in their lands, according to their nations.

<sup>32</sup> These were the clans of the sons of Noaḥ, according to their generations, in their nations. And from these the nations were divided on the earth after the flood.
