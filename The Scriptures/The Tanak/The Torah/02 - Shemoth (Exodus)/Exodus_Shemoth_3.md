<sup>1</sup> And Mosheh was shepherding the flock of Yithro his father-in-law, the priest of Miḏyan. And he led the flock to the back of the wilderness, and came to Ḥorĕḇ, the mountain of Elohim.

<sup>2</sup> And the Messenger of יהוה appeared to him in a flame of fire from the midst of a bush. And he looked and saw the bush burning with fire, but the bush was not consumed.

<sup>3</sup> And Mosheh said, “Let me turn aside now, and see this great sight, why the bush does not burn.”

<sup>4</sup> And יהוה saw that he turned aside to see, and Elohim called to him from the midst of the bush and said, “Mosheh! Mosheh!” And he said, “Here I am.”

<sup>5</sup> And He said, “Do not come near here. Take your sandals off your feet, for the place on which you are standing is set-apart ground.”

<sup>6</sup> And He said, “I am the Elohim of your father, the Elohim of Aḇraham, the Elohim of Yitsḥaq, and the Elohim of Ya‛aqoḇ.” And Mosheh hid his face, for he was afraid to look at Elohim.

<sup>7</sup> And יהוה said, “I have indeed seen the oppression of My people who are in Mitsrayim, and have heard their cry because of their slave-drivers, for I know their sorrows.

<sup>8</sup> “And I have come down to deliver them from the hand of the Mitsrites, and to bring them up from that land to a good and spacious land, to a land flowing with milk and honey, to the place of the Kena‛anites and the Ḥittites and the Amorites and the Perizzites and the Ḥiwwites and the Yeḇusites.

<sup>9</sup> “And now, see, the cry of the children of Yisra’ĕl has come to Me, and I have also seen the oppression with which the Mitsrites oppress them.

<sup>10</sup> “And now, come, I am sending you to Pharaoh, to bring My people, the children of Yisra’ĕl, out of Mitsrayim.”

<sup>11</sup> And Mosheh said to Elohim, “Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring the children of Yisra’ĕl out of Mitsrayim?”

<sup>12</sup> And He said, “Because I am with you. And this is to you the sign that I have sent you: When you have brought the people out of Mitsrayim, you are to serve Elohim on this mountain.”

<sup>13</sup> And Mosheh said to Elohim, “See, when I come to the children of Yisra’ĕl and say to them, ‘The Elohim of your fathers has sent me to you,’ and they say to me, ‘What is His Name?’ what shall I say to them?”

<sup>14</sup> And Elohim said to Mosheh, “I am that which I am.” And He said, “Thus you shall say to the children of Yisra’ĕl, ‘I am has sent me to you.’ ”

<sup>15</sup> And Elohim said further to Mosheh, “Thus you are to say to the children of Yisra’ĕl, ‘ יהוה Elohim of your fathers, the Elohim of Aḇraham, the Elohim of Yitsḥaq, and the Elohim of Ya‛aqoḇ, has sent me to you. This is My Name forever, and this is My remembrance to all generations.’

<sup>16</sup> “Go, and you shall gather the elders of Yisra’ĕl together, and say to them, ‘ יהוה Elohim of your fathers, the Elohim of Aḇraham, of Yitsḥaq, and of Ya‛aqoḇ, appeared to me, saying, “I have indeed visited you and seen what is done to you in Mitsrayim;

<sup>17</sup> and I say: I am bringing you up out of the affliction of Mitsrayim to the land of the Kena‛anite and the Ḥittite and the Amorite and the Perizzite and the Ḥiwwite and the Yeḇusite, to a land flowing with milk and honey.” ’

<sup>18</sup> “And they shall listen to your voice. And you shall come, you and the elders of Yisra’ĕl, to the sovereign of Mitsrayim, and you shall say to him, ‘ יהוה Elohim of the Heḇrews has met with us. And now, please, let us go three days’ journey into the wilderness to slaughter to יהוה our Elohim.’

<sup>19</sup> “But I know that the sovereign of Mitsrayim is not going to let you go, not even by a strong hand.

<sup>20</sup> “And I shall stretch out My hand and smite Mitsrayim with all My wonders which I shall do in its midst. And after that he shall let you go.

<sup>21</sup> “And I shall give this people favour in the eyes of the Mitsrites. And it shall be, that when you go, you shall not go empty-handed.

<sup>22</sup> “But every woman shall ask from her neighbour and from the stranger in her house, objects of silver, and objects of gold, and garments. And you shall put them on your sons and on your daughters, and shall plunder the Mitsrites.”
