<sup>2</sup> and unleavened bread, and unleavened cakes mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil – make these of wheat flour.

<sup>3</sup> “And you shall put them in one basket and bring them in the basket, along with the bull and the two rams.

<sup>4</sup> “Then you shall bring Aharon and his sons to the door of the Tent of Meeting, and wash them with water.

<sup>5</sup> “And you shall take the garments, and shall put on Aharon the long shirt, and the robe of the shoulder garment, and the shoulder garment, and the breastplate, and shall gird him with the embroidered band of the shoulder garment,

<sup>6</sup> and shall put the turban on his head, and shall put the set-apart sign of dedication on the turban,

<sup>13</sup> “And you shall take all the fat that covers the entrails, and the appendage on the liver, and the two kidneys and the fat that is on them, and burn them on the altar.

<sup>14</sup> “But the flesh of the bull, and its skin and its dung, you shall burn with fire outside the camp. It is a sin offering.

<sup>15</sup> “And take one ram, and Aharon and his sons shall lay their hands on the head of the ram,

<sup>16</sup> and you shall slaughter the ram, and you shall take its blood and sprinkle it all around on the altar.

<sup>17</sup> “And cut the ram in pieces, and wash its entrails and its legs, and place them upon its pieces and on its head.

<sup>18</sup> “And you shall burn the entire ram on the altar. It is a burnt offering to יהוה, it is a sweet fragrance, an offering made by fire to יהוה.

<sup>19</sup> “And you shall take the second ram, and Aharon and his sons shall lay their hands on the head of the ram,

<sup>20</sup> and you shall slaughter the ram, and take some of its blood and put it on the tip of the right ear of Aharon and on the tip of the right ear of his sons, on the thumb of their right hand and on the big toe of their right foot, and sprinkle the blood all around on the altar.

<sup>22</sup> “And you shall take the fat of the ram, and the fat tail, and the fat that covers the entrails, and the appendage on the liver, and the two kidneys and the fat on them, and the right thigh – it is for a ram of ordination –

<sup>23</sup> and one loaf of bread, and one cake made with oil, and one thin cake from the basket of the unleavened bread that is before יהוה.

<sup>24</sup> “And you shall put all these in the hands of Aharon and in the hands of his sons, and you shall wave them – a wave offering before יהוה.

<sup>25</sup> “Then you shall take them from their hands and burn them on the altar as a burnt offering, as a sweet fragrance before יהוה. It is an offering made by fire to יהוה.

<sup>26</sup> “And you shall take the breast of the ram of Aharon’s ordination and wave it – a wave offering before יהוה, and it shall be your portion.

<sup>27</sup> “And from the ram of ordination you shall set apart the breast of the wave offering which is waved, and the thigh of the contribution which is raised, of that which is for Aharon and of that which is for his sons.

<sup>28</sup> “And it shall be from the children of Yisra’ĕl for Aharon and his sons by a law forever, for it is a contribution. And it is a contribution from the children of Yisra’ĕl from their peace offerings – their contribution to יהוה.

<sup>34</sup> “And if any of the flesh of the ordination offerings, or of the bread, be left over until the morning, then you shall burn up what is left over. It is not eaten, because it is set-apart.

<sup>35</sup> “And so you shall do to Aharon and his sons, according to all I have commanded you. Seven days you shall ordain them,

<sup>36</sup> and prepare a bull each day as a sin offering for atonement. And you shall cleanse the altar when you make atonement for it, and you shall anoint it to set it apart.

<sup>37</sup> “For seven days you shall make atonement for the altar, and set it apart. And the altar shall be most set-apart – whatever touches the altar is to be set-apart.

<sup>38</sup> “And this is what you prepare on the altar: two lambs, a year old, daily, continually.

<sup>39</sup> “Prepare the one lamb in the morning, and the other lamb you prepare between the evenings,
