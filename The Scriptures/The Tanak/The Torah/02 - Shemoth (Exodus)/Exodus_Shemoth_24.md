<sup>1</sup> And to Mosheh He said, “Come up to יהוה, you and Aharon, Naḏaḇ and Aḇihu, and seventy of the elders of Yisra’ĕl, and you shall bow yourselves from a distance.

<sup>2</sup> “But Mosheh shall draw near to יהוה by himself, and let them not draw near, nor let the people go up with him.”

<sup>3</sup> And Mosheh came and related to the people all the Words of יהוה and all the right-rulings. And all the people answered with one voice and said, “All the Words which יהוה has spoken we shall do.”

<sup>4</sup> And Mosheh wrote down all the Words of יהוה, and rose up early in the morning, and built an altar at the foot of the mountain, and twelve standing columns for the twelve tribes of Yisra’ĕl.

<sup>5</sup> And he sent young men of the children of Yisra’ĕl, and they offered burnt offerings and slaughtered peace slaughterings of bulls to יהוה.

<sup>6</sup> And Mosheh took half the blood and put it in basins, and half the blood he sprinkled on the altar.

<sup>7</sup> And he took the Book of the Covenant and read in the hearing of the people. And they said, “All that יהוה has spoken we shall do, and obey.”

<sup>8</sup> And Mosheh took the blood and sprinkled it on the people, and said, “See, the blood of the covenant which יהוה has made with you concerning all these Words.”

<sup>9</sup> And Mosheh went up, also Aharon, Naḏaḇ, and Aḇihu, and seventy of the elders of Yisra’ĕl,

<sup>10</sup> and they saw the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, and under His feet like a paved work of sapphire stone, and like the heavens for brightness.

<sup>11</sup> Yet He did not stretch out His hand against the chiefs of the children of Yisra’ĕl! And they saw Elohim, and they ate and drank.

<sup>12</sup> And יהוה said to Mosheh, “Come up to Me on the mountain and be there, while I give you tablets of stone, and the Torah and the command which I have written, to teach them.”

<sup>13</sup> And Mosheh arose with his assistant Yehoshua, and Mosheh went up to the mountain of Elohim.

<sup>14</sup> And he said to the elders, “Wait here for us until we come back to you. And see, Aharon and Ḥur are with you. Whoever has matters, let him go to them.”

<sup>15</sup> And Mosheh went up into the mountain, and a cloud covered the mountain.

<sup>16</sup> And the esteem of יהוה dwelt on Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it for six days. And on the seventh day He called to Mosheh out of the midst of the cloud.

<sup>17</sup> And the appearance of the esteem of יהוה was like a consuming fire on the top of the mountain, before the eyes of the children of Yisra’ĕl.

<sup>18</sup> And Mosheh went into the midst of the cloud and went up into the mountain. And it came to be that Mosheh was on the mountain forty days and forty nights.

<sup>1</sup> And to Mosheh He said, “Come up to יהוה, you and Aharon, Naḏaḇ and Aḇihu, and seventy of the elders of Yisra’ĕl, and you shall bow yourselves from a distance.

<sup>2</sup> “But Mosheh shall draw near to יהוה by himself, and let them not draw near, nor let the people go up with him.”

<sup>3</sup> And Mosheh came and related to the people all the Words of יהוה and all the right-rulings. And all the people answered with one voice and said, “All the Words which יהוה has spoken we shall do.”
