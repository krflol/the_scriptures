<sup>2</sup> “Speak now in the hearing of the people, and let every man ask from his neighbour and every woman from her neighbour, objects of silver and objects of gold.”

<sup>3</sup> And יהוה gave the people favour in the eyes of the Mitsrites. And the man Mosheh was very great in the land of Mitsrayim, in the eyes of Pharaoh’s servants and in the eyes of the people.

<sup>4</sup> And Mosheh said, “Thus said יהוה, ‘About midnight I am going out into the midst of Mitsrayim,

<sup>5</sup> and all the first-born in the land of Mitsrayim shall die, from the first-born of Pharaoh who sits on his throne, even to the first-born of the female servant who is behind the handmill, and all the first-born of cattle.

<sup>6</sup> ‘And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Mitsrayim, such as has never been or ever be again.

<sup>7</sup> ‘But against any of the children of Yisra’ĕl no dog shall move its tongue, against man or against beast, so that you know that יהוה makes distinction between Mitsrayim and Yisra’ĕl.’

<sup>8</sup> “And all these servants of yours shall come down to me and bow down to me, saying, ‘Get out, you and all the people at your feet!’ And after that I shall go out.” And he went out from Pharaoh in great displeasure.

<sup>9</sup> But יהוה said to Mosheh, “Pharaoh is not going to listen to you, in order to multiply My wonders in the land of Mitsrayim.”

<sup>10</sup> And Mosheh and Aharon did all these wonders before Pharaoh, however, יהוה hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he did not let the children of Yisra’ĕl go out of his land.
