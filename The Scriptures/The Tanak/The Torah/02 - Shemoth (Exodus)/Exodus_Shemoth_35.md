<sup>1</sup> And Mosheh assembled all the congregation of the children of Yisra’ĕl, and said to them, “These are the Words which יהוה has commanded you to do:

<sup>2</sup> “Work is done for six days, but on the seventh day it shall be set-apart to you, a Sabbath of rest to יהוה. Anyone doing work on it is put to death.

<sup>3</sup> “Do not kindle a fire in any of your dwellings on the Sabbath day.”

<sup>4</sup> And Mosheh spoke to all the congregation of the children of Yisra’ĕl, saying, “This is the word which יהוה commanded, saying,

<sup>5</sup> ‘Take from among you a contribution to יהוה. Everyone whose heart so moves him, let him bring it as a contribution to יהוה : gold, and silver, and bronze,

<sup>6</sup> and blue, and purple, and scarlet material, and fine linen, and goats’ hair,

<sup>8</sup> and oil for the light, and spices for the anointing oil and for the sweet incense,

<sup>9</sup> and shoham stones, and stones to be set in the shoulder garment and in the breastplate.

<sup>10</sup> ‘And let all the wise-hearted among you come and make all that יהוה has commanded:
