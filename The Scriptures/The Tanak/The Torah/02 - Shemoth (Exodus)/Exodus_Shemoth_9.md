<sup>1</sup> And יהוה said to Mosheh, “Go in to Pharaoh and speak to him, ‘Thus said יהוה Elohim of the Heḇrews, “Let My people go, so that they serve Me.

<sup>2</sup> “For if you refuse to let them go, and still hold them,

<sup>3</sup> see, the hand of יהוה is on your livestock in the field, on the horses, on the donkeys, on the camels, on the cattle, and on the sheep – a very grievous pestilence.

<sup>4</sup> “And יהוה shall separate between the livestock of Yisra’ĕl and the livestock of Mitsrayim, and let no matter die of all that belongs to the children of Yisra’ĕl.” ’ ”

<sup>5</sup> And יהוה set an appointed time, saying, “Tomorrow יהוה is going to do this word in the land.”

<sup>6</sup> And יהוה did this word on the next day, and all the livestock of Mitsrayim died, but of the livestock of the children of Yisra’ĕl, not one died.

<sup>7</sup> Then Pharaoh sent, and see, not even one of the livestock of the Yisra’ĕlites was dead. But the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go.

<sup>8</sup> And יהוה said to Mosheh and Aharon, “Fill your hands with ashes from a furnace and let Mosheh scatter it toward the heavens before the eyes of Pharaoh.

<sup>9</sup> “And it shall become fine dust in all the land of Mitsrayim, and it shall cause boils that break out in sores on man and beast in all the land of Mitsrayim.”

<sup>10</sup> So they took ashes from the furnace and stood before Pharaoh, and Mosheh scattered them toward the heavens. And they caused boils, breaking out in sores on man and beast.

<sup>11</sup> And the magicians were unable to stand before Mosheh because of the boils, for the boils were on the magicians and on all the Mitsrites.

<sup>12</sup> But יהוה hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he did not listen to them, as יהוה had said to Mosheh.

<sup>13</sup> And יהוה said to Mosheh, “Rise early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh, and say to him, ‘Thus said יהוה Elohim of the Heḇrews, “Let My people go, so that they serve Me,

<sup>14</sup> for at this time I am sending all My plagues unto your heart, and on your servants and on your people, so that you know that there is no one like Me in all the earth.

<sup>15</sup> “Now if I had stretched out My hand and struck you and your people with pestilence, then you would have been cut off from the earth.

<sup>16</sup> “And for this reason I have raised you up, in order to show you My power, and in order to declare My Name in all the earth.

<sup>17</sup> “You still exalt yourself against My people in that you do not let them go!

<sup>18</sup> “See, tomorrow about this time I am causing very heavy hail to rain down, such as has not been in Mitsrayim, from the day of its founding until now.

<sup>19</sup> “And now send, bring your livestock to safety, and all that you have in the field, for the hail shall come down on every man and every beast which is found in the field and is not brought home, and they shall die.” ’ ”

<sup>20</sup> Those among the servants of Pharaoh who feared the word of יהוה made their servants and livestock flee to the houses.

<sup>21</sup> But those who did not set their heart on the word of יהוה left their servants and livestock in the field.

<sup>22</sup> Then יהוה said to Mosheh, “Stretch out your hand toward the heavens, and let there be hail in all the land of Mitsrayim – on man, and on beast, and on every plant of the field, throughout the land of Mitsrayim.”

<sup>23</sup> Then Mosheh stretched out his rod toward the heavens. And יהוה sent thunder and hail, and fire came down to the earth. And יהוה rained hail on the land of Mitsrayim.

<sup>24</sup> Thus there came to be hail, and fire flashing continually in the midst of the hail, very heavy, such as had not been in all the land of Mitsrayim since it became a nation.

<sup>25</sup> And the hail smote in all the land of Mitsrayim all that was in the field, both man and beast. And the hail smote every plant of the field and broke every tree of the field.

<sup>26</sup> Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Yisra’ĕl were, there was no hail.

<sup>27</sup> Pharaoh then sent and called for Mosheh and for Aharon, and said to them, “I have sinned this time. יהוה is righteous, and my people and I are wrong.

<sup>28</sup> “Pray to יהוה, for there has been enough of the thunder and hail of Elohim. And I am letting you go, so that you stay no longer.”

<sup>29</sup> And Mosheh said to him, “As soon as I go out of the city, let me spread out my hands to יהוה, let the thunder cease and the hail be no more, so that you know that the earth belongs to יהוה.

<sup>30</sup> “But as for you and your servants, I know that you do not yet fear before יהוה Elohim.”

<sup>31</sup> And the flax and the barley were smitten, for the barley was in the head and the flax was in bud.

<sup>32</sup> But the wheat and the spelt were not smitten, for they were late crops.

<sup>33</sup> And Mosheh went out of the city from Pharaoh and spread out his hands to יהוה, and the thunder and the hail ceased, and the rain was not poured on the earth.

<sup>34</sup> And Pharaoh saw that the rain, and the hail, and the thunder had ceased, yet he sinned again and he hardened his heart, he and his servants.

<sup>35</sup> And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the children of Yisra’ĕl go, as יהוה had said through Mosheh.
