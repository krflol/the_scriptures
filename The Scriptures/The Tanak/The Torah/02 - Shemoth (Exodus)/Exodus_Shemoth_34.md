<sup>1</sup> And יהוה said to Mosheh, “Cut two tablets of stone like the first ones, and I shall write on these tablets the Words that were on the first tablets which you broke.

<sup>2</sup> “And be ready in the morning. Then you shall come up in the morning to Mount Sinai, and present yourself to Me there on the top of the mountain.

<sup>3</sup> “And let no man come up with you, and let no man be seen in all the mountain, and let not even the flock or the herd feed in front of that mountain.”

<sup>4</sup> And he cut two tablets of stone like the first ones. Then Mosheh rose early in the morning and went up Mount Sinai, as יהוה had commanded him, and he took two tablets of stone in his hand.

<sup>5</sup> And יהוה came down in the cloud and stood with him there, and proclaimed the Name, יהוה.

<sup>6</sup> And יהוה passed before him and proclaimed, “ יהוה, יהוה, an Ĕl compassionate and showing favour, patient, and great in kindness and truth,

<sup>7</sup> watching over kindness for thousands, forgiving crookedness and transgression and sin, but by no means leaving unpunished, visiting the crookedness of the fathers upon the children and the children’s children to the third and the fourth generation.”

<sup>8</sup> And Mosheh hurried and bowed himself toward the earth, and did obeisance,

<sup>9</sup> and said, “If, now, I have found favour in Your eyes, O יהוה, I pray, let יהוה go on in our midst, even though we are a stiff-necked people. And forgive our crookedness and our sin, and take us as Your inheritance.”

<sup>10</sup> And He said, “See, I am making a covenant. Before all your people I am going to do wonders such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation. And all the people among whom you are shall see the work of יהוה. For what I am doing with you is awesome.

<sup>11</sup> “Guard what I command you today. See, I am driving out from before you the Amorite and the Kena‛anite and the Ḥittite and the Perizzite and the Ḥiwwite and the Yeḇusite.

<sup>12</sup> “Guard yourself, lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land where you are going, lest it be a snare in your midst.

<sup>13</sup> “But break down their altars, and smash their pillars, and cut down their Ashĕrim –

<sup>14</sup> for you do not bow yourselves to another mighty one, for יהוה, whose Name is jealous, is a jealous Ĕl –

<sup>15</sup> lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they whore after their mighty ones, and slaughter to their mighty ones, and one of them invites you and you eat of his slaughterings,

<sup>16</sup> and you take of his daughters for your sons, and his daughters whore after their mighty ones, and make your sons whore after their mighty ones.

<sup>17</sup> “Do not make a moulded mighty one for yourselves.

<sup>18</sup> “Guard the Festival of Unleavened Bread. For seven days you eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you, in the appointed time of the month of Aḇiḇ, because in the month of Aḇiḇ you came out from Mitsrayim.

<sup>19</sup> “Everyone opening the womb is Mine, and every male first-born among your livestock, whether bull or sheep.

<sup>20</sup> “But the first-born of a donkey you ransom with a lamb. And if you do not ransom, then you shall break his neck. Every first-born of your sons you shall ransom. And they shall not appear before Me empty-handed.

<sup>21</sup> “Six days you work, but on the seventh day you rest – in ploughing time and in harvest you rest.

<sup>22</sup> “And perform the Festival of Weeks for yourself, of the first-fruits of wheat harvest, and the Festival of Ingathering at the turn of the year.

<sup>23</sup> “Three times in the year all your men are to appear before the Master, יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl,

<sup>24</sup> for I dispossess nations before you, and shall enlarge your borders, and let no one covet your land when you go up to appear before יהוה your Elohim three times in the year.

<sup>25</sup> “Do not offer the blood of My slaughtering with leaven, and do not let the slaughtering of the Festival of the Passover remain until morning.

<sup>26</sup> “Bring the first of the first-fruits of your land to the House of יהוה your Elohim. Do not cook a young goat in its mother’s milk.”

<sup>27</sup> And יהוה said to Mosheh, “Write these Words, for according to the mouth of these Words I have made a covenant with you and with Yisra’ĕl.”

<sup>28</sup> And he was there with יהוה forty days and forty nights. He did not eat bread and he did not drink water. And He wrote on the tablets the Words of the covenant, the Ten Words.

<sup>29</sup> And it came to be, when Mosheh came down from Mount Sinai, while the two tablets of the Witness were in Mosheh’s hand when he came down from the mountain, that Mosheh did not know that the skin of his face shone since he had spoken with Him.

<sup>30</sup> And Aharon and all the children of Yisra’ĕl looked at Mosheh and saw the skin of his face shone, and they were afraid to come near him.

<sup>31</sup> But Mosheh called out to them, and Aharon and all the rulers of the congregation returned to him, and Mosheh spoke to them.

<sup>32</sup> And afterward all the children of Yisra’ĕl came near, and he commanded them all that יהוה had spoken with him on Mount Sinai.

<sup>33</sup> And when Mosheh ended speaking with them, he put a veil on his face.

<sup>34</sup> But whenever Mosheh went in before יהוה to speak with Him, he would remove the veil until he came out. And when he came out he spoke to the children of Yisra’ĕl what he had been commanded,

<sup>35</sup> and the children of Yisra’ĕl would see the face of Mosheh, that the skin of Mosheh’s face shone, and Mosheh would put the veil on his face again, until he went in to speak with Him.
