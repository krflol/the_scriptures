<sup>1</sup> And they set out from Ĕlim, and all the congregation of the children of Yisra’ĕl came to the Wilderness of Sin, which is between Ĕlim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their going out of the land of Mitsrayim.

<sup>2</sup> And all the congregation of the children of Yisra’ĕl grumbled against Mosheh and Aharon in the wilderness.

<sup>3</sup> And the children of Yisra’ĕl said to them, “If only we had died by the hand of יהוה in the land of Mitsrayim, when we sat by the pots of meat and when we ate bread to satisfaction! For you have brought us out into this wilderness to put all this assembly to death with hunger.”

<sup>4</sup> And יהוה said to Mosheh, “See, I am raining bread from the heavens for you. And the people shall go out and gather a day’s portion every day, in order to try them, whether they walk in My Torah or not.

<sup>5</sup> “And it shall be on the sixth day that they shall prepare what they bring in, and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily.”

<sup>6</sup> And Mosheh and Aharon said to all the children of Yisra’ĕl, “At evening you shall know that יהוה has brought you out of the land of Mitsrayim.

<sup>7</sup> “And in the morning you shall see the esteem of יהוה, for He hears your grumblings against יהוה. And what are we, that you grumble against us?”

<sup>8</sup> And Mosheh said, “In that יהוה gives you meat to eat in the evening, and in the morning bread to satisfaction, for יהוה hears your grumblings which you make against Him. And what are we? Your grumblings are not against us but against יהוה.”

<sup>9</sup> And Mosheh said to Aharon, “Say to all the congregation of the children of Yisra’ĕl, ‘Come near before יהוה, for He has heard your grumblings.’ ”

<sup>10</sup> And it came to be, as Aharon spoke to all the congregation of the children of Yisra’ĕl, that they looked toward the wilderness and see, the esteem of יהוה appeared in the cloud.

<sup>11</sup> And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,

<sup>12</sup> “I have heard the grumblings of the children of Yisra’ĕl. Speak to them, saying, ‘Between the evenings you are to eat meat, and in the morning you are to be satisfied with bread. And you shall know that I am יהוה your Elohim.’ ”

<sup>13</sup> And it came to be that quails came up at evening and covered the camp, and in the morning the dew lay all around the camp.

<sup>14</sup> And the layer of dew went up, and see, on the surface of the wilderness, was a small round substance, as fine as frost on the ground.

<sup>15</sup> And the children of Yisra’ĕl saw, and they said to each other, “What is it?” For they did not know what it was. And Mosheh said to them, “It is the bread which יהוה has given you to eat.

<sup>16</sup> “This is the word which יהוה has commanded: ‘Let every man gather it according to each one’s need, an omer for each being, according to the number of beings. Let every man take for those who are in his tent.’ ”

<sup>17</sup> And the children of Yisra’ĕl did so and gathered, some more, some less.

<sup>18</sup> And they measured it by omers, and he who gathered much did not have too much, and he who gathered little did not have too little. Each one gathered according to his need.

<sup>19</sup> And Mosheh said, “Let no one leave any of it until morning.”

<sup>20</sup> And they did not listen to Mosheh, so some of them left part of it until morning, and it bred worms and stank. And Mosheh was wroth with them.

<sup>21</sup> And they gathered it every morning, each one according to his need. And when the sun became hot, it melted.

<sup>22</sup> And it came to be, on the sixth day, that they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one. And all the rulers of the congregation came and told Mosheh.

<sup>23</sup> And he said to them, “This is what יהוה has said, ‘Tomorrow is a rest, a Sabbath set-apart to יהוה. That which you bake, bake; and that which you cook, cook. And lay up for yourselves all that is left over, to keep it until morning.’ ”

<sup>24</sup> And they laid it up till morning, as Mosheh commanded. And it did not stink, and no worm was in it.

<sup>25</sup> And Mosheh said, “Eat it today, for today is a Sabbath to יהוה, today you do not find it in the field.

<sup>26</sup> “Gather it six days, but on the seventh day, which is the Sabbath, there is none.”

<sup>27</sup> And it came to be that some of the people went out on the seventh day to gather, but they found none.

<sup>28</sup> And יהוה said to Mosheh, “How long shall you refuse to guard My commands and My Torot?

<sup>29</sup> “See, because יהוה has given you the Sabbath, therefore He is giving you bread for two days on the sixth day. Let each one stay in his place, do not let anyone go out of his place on the seventh day.”

<sup>30</sup> So the people rested on the seventh day.

<sup>31</sup> And the house of Yisra’ĕl called its name Manna. And it was like white coriander seed, and the taste of it was like thin cakes made with honey.

<sup>32</sup> And Mosheh said, “This is the word which יהוה has commanded: ‘Fill an omer with it, to keep for your generations, so that they see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you out of the land of Mitsrayim.’ ”

<sup>33</sup> And Mosheh said to Aharon, “Take a pot and put an omer of manna in it, and set it down before יהוה, to keep for your generations.”

<sup>34</sup> As יהוה commanded Mosheh, so did Aharon set it down before the Witness, to keep.

<sup>35</sup> And the children of Yisra’ĕl ate manna forty years, until they came to an inhabited land. They ate manna until they came to the border of the land of Kena‛an.

<sup>36</sup> And an omer is one-tenth of an ĕphah.

<sup>1</sup> And they set out from Ĕlim, and all the congregation of the children of Yisra’ĕl came to the Wilderness of Sin, which is between Ĕlim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their going out of the land of Mitsrayim.

<sup>2</sup> And all the congregation of the children of Yisra’ĕl grumbled against Mosheh and Aharon in the wilderness.

<sup>9</sup> And Mosheh said to Aharon, “Say to all the congregation of the children of Yisra’ĕl, ‘Come near before יהוה, for He has heard your grumblings.’ ”

<sup>10</sup> And it came to be, as Aharon spoke to all the congregation of the children of Yisra’ĕl, that they looked toward the wilderness and see, the esteem of יהוה appeared in the cloud.

<sup>11</sup> And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,

<sup>12</sup> “I have heard the grumblings of the children of Yisra’ĕl. Speak to them, saying, ‘Between the evenings you are to eat meat, and in the morning you are to be satisfied with bread. And you shall know that I am יהוה your Elohim.’ ”

<sup>13</sup> And it came to be that quails came up at evening and covered the camp, and in the morning the dew lay all around the camp.

<sup>30</sup> So the people rested on the seventh day.
