<sup>1</sup> And a man of the house of Lĕwi went and married a daughter of Lĕwi.

<sup>2</sup> And the woman conceived and bore a son. And she saw that he was a lovely child, and she hid him three months.

<sup>3</sup> And when she could hide him no longer, she took an ark of wicker for him, and coated it with tar and pitch, and put the child in it, and laid it in the reeds by the edge of the river.

<sup>4</sup> And his sister stood at a distance, to know what would be done to him.

<sup>5</sup> And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river, and her young women were walking by the river-side. And when she saw the ark among the reeds, she sent her female servant to get it,

<sup>6</sup> and opened it and saw the child, and see, the baby wept. So she had compassion on him, and said, “This is one of the children of the Heḇrews.”

<sup>7</sup> And his sister said to Pharaoh’s daughter, “Shall I go and call a nurse for you from the Heḇrew women to nurse the child for you?”

<sup>8</sup> And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Go.” And the girl went and called the child’s mother.

<sup>9</sup> And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Take this child away and nurse him for me, then I shall pay your wages.” So the woman took the child and nursed him.

<sup>10</sup> And the child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh’s daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Mosheh, saying, “Because I have drawn him out of the water.”

<sup>11</sup> And in those days it came to be, when Mosheh was grown, that he went out to his brothers and looked at their burdens. And he saw a Mitsrite beating a Heḇrew, one of his brothers.

<sup>12</sup> So he turned this way and that way, and when he saw no one, he smote the Mitsrite and hid him in the sand.

<sup>13</sup> And he went out the second day and saw two Heḇrew men fighting, and he said to the one who did the wrong, “Why do you smite your neighbour?”

<sup>14</sup> And he said, “Who made you a head and a judge over us? Do you intend to slay me as you slew the Mitsrite?” And Mosheh feared and said, “Truly, the matter is known!”

<sup>15</sup> And Pharaoh heard of this matter, and he sought to kill Mosheh. But Mosheh fled from the face of Pharaoh and dwelt in the land of Miḏyan. And he sat down by a well.

<sup>16</sup> And the priest of Miḏyan had seven daughters. And they came and drew water, and they filled the troughs to water their father’s flock,

<sup>17</sup> but the shepherds came and drove them away. Then Mosheh stood up and came to their rescue, and watered their flock.

<sup>18</sup> And they came to Re‛uw’ĕl their father, and he said, “How is it that you have come so soon today?”

<sup>19</sup> And they said, “A Mitsrite rescued us from the hand of the shepherds, and he also drew enough water for us and watered the flock.”

<sup>20</sup> And he said to his daughters, “And where is he? Why did you leave the man? Call him and let him eat bread.”

<sup>21</sup> And Mosheh agreed to dwell with the man, and he gave Tsipporah his daughter to Mosheh.

<sup>22</sup> And she bore him a son, and he called his name Gĕreshom, for he said, “I have become a sojourner in a foreign land.”

<sup>23</sup> And it came to be after these many days that the sovereign of Mitsrayim died. And the children of Yisra’ĕl groaned because of the slavery, and they cried out. And their cry came up to Elohim because of the slavery.

<sup>24</sup> And Elohim heard their groaning, and Elohim remembered His covenant with Aḇraham, with Yitsḥaq, and with Ya‛aqoḇ.

<sup>25</sup> And Elohim looked on the children of Yisra’ĕl, and Elohim knew!
