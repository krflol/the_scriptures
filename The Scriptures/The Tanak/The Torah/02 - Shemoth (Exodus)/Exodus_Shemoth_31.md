<sup>1</sup> And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,

<sup>2</sup> “See, I have called by name Betsal’ĕl son of Uri, son of Ḥur, of the tribe of Yehuḏah,

<sup>3</sup> and I have filled him with the Spirit of Elohim in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all work,

<sup>4</sup> to make designs for work in gold, and in silver, and in bronze,

<sup>5</sup> and in cutting stones for setting, and in carving wood, and to work in all work.

<sup>6</sup> “And I, look I have appointed with him Oholiaḇ son of Aḥisamaḵ, of the tribe of Dan. And I have put wisdom in the hearts of everyone who is wise-hearted, and they shall make all that I have commanded you:

<sup>7</sup> the Tent of Meeting, and the ark of the Witness and the lid of atonement that is on it, and all the utensils of the Tent,

<sup>8</sup> and the table and its utensils, and the clean gold lampstand with all its utensils, and the altar of incense,

<sup>9</sup> and the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, and the basin and its stand,

<sup>10</sup> and the woven garments, and the set-apart garments for Aharon the priest and the garments of his sons, for serving as priests,

<sup>11</sup> and the anointing oil and sweet incense for the Set-apart Place. According to all that I have commanded you, they are to do.”

<sup>12</sup> And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,

<sup>13</sup> “And you, speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl, saying, ‘My Sabbaths you are to guard, by all means, for it is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations, to know that I, יהוה, am setting you apart.

<sup>14</sup> ‘And you shall guard the Sabbath, for it is set-apart to you. Everyone who profanes it shall certainly be put to death, for anyone who does work on it, that being shall be cut off from among his people.

<sup>15</sup> ‘Six days work is done, and on the seventh is a Sabbath of rest, set-apart to יהוה. Everyone doing work on the Sabbath day shall certainly be put to death.

<sup>16</sup> ‘And the children of Yisra’ĕl shall guard the Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath throughout their generations as an everlasting covenant.

<sup>17</sup> ‘Between Me and the children of Yisra’ĕl it is a sign forever. For in six days יהוה made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh day He rested and was refreshed.’ ”

<sup>18</sup> And when He had ended speaking with him on Mount Sinai, He gave Mosheh two tablets of the Witness, tablets of stone, written with the finger of Elohim.
