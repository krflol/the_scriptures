<sup>1</sup> And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,

<sup>2</sup> “Make two silver trumpets for yourself, make them of beaten work. And you shall use them for calling the congregation and for breaking camp.

<sup>3</sup> “And when they blow both of them, all the congregation shall meet before you at the door of the Tent of Meeting.

<sup>4</sup> “And if they blow one, then the leaders, the heads of the thousands of Yisra’ĕl, shall gather to you.

<sup>5</sup> “And when you blow a shout, the camps that lie on the east side shall depart.

<sup>6</sup> “And when you blow a shout the second time, then the camps that lie on the south side shall depart – they blow a shout for them to depart.

<sup>7</sup> “And when the assembly is to be assembled, you blow, but do not shout.

<sup>8</sup> “And the sons of Aharon, the priests, blow with the trumpets. And it shall be to you for a law forever throughout your generations.

<sup>9</sup> “And when you go into battle in your land against the enemy that distresses you, then you shall shout with the trumpets, and you shall be remembered before יהוה your Elohim, and you shall be saved from your enemies.

<sup>10</sup> “And in the day of your gladness, and in your appointed times, and at the beginning of your months, you shall blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings and over your peace offerings. And they shall be a remembrance for you before your Elohim. I am יהוה your Elohim.”

<sup>11</sup> And it came to be on the twentieth day of the second month, in the second year, that the cloud was taken up from above the Dwelling Place of the Witness.

<sup>12</sup> And the children of Yisra’ĕl departed, setting out from the Wilderness of Sinai. And the cloud dwelt on it in the Wilderness of Paran.

<sup>13</sup> Thus they departed the first time, according to the command of יהוה by the hand of Mosheh.

<sup>14</sup> And the banner of the camp of the children of Yehuḏah departed first according to their divisions. And over their army was Naḥshon, son of Amminaḏaḇ.

<sup>15</sup> And over the army of the tribe of the children of Yissasḵar was Nethanĕ’l, son of Tsu‛ar.

<sup>16</sup> And over the army of the tribe of the children of Zeḇulun was Eliyaḇ, son of Ḥĕlon.

<sup>17</sup> And the Dwelling Place was taken down. And the sons of Gĕreshon and the sons of Merari departed, bearing the Dwelling Place.

<sup>18</sup> And the banner of the camp of Re’uḇĕn departed according to their divisions. And over their army was Elitsur, son of Sheḏĕy’ur.

<sup>19</sup> And over the army of the tribe of the children of Shim‛on was Shelumi’ĕl, son of Tsurishaddai.

<sup>20</sup> And over the army of the tribe of the children of Gaḏ was Elyasaph, the son of Deu’ĕl.

<sup>21</sup> And the Qehathites departed, bearing the set-apart objects, while the Dwelling Place was set up before they came.

<sup>22</sup> And the banner of the camp of the children of Ephrayim departed according to their divisions. And over their army was Elishama, son of Ammihuḏ.

<sup>23</sup> And over the army of the tribe of the children of Menashsheh was Gamli’ĕl, son of Peḏahtsur.

<sup>24</sup> And over the army of the tribe of the children of Binyamin was Aḇiḏan, son of Giḏ‛oni.

<sup>25</sup> Then the banner of the camp of the children of Dan, which formed the rear guard of all the camps, departed according to their divisions. And over their army was Aḥi‛ezer, son of Ammishaddai.

<sup>26</sup> And over the army of the tribe of the children of Ashĕr was Paḡ‛i’ĕl, the son of Oḵran.

<sup>27</sup> And over the army of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was Aḥira, the son of Ĕnan.

<sup>28</sup> Such was the order of setting out of the children of Yisra’ĕl, according to their divisions, when they departed.

<sup>29</sup> And Mosheh said to Ḥoḇaḇ, the son of Re‛uw’ĕl the Miḏyanite, Mosheh’s father-in-law, “We are setting out for the place of which יהוה said, ‘I give it to you.’ Come with us, and we shall do good to you, for יהוה has spoken good concerning Yisra’ĕl.”

<sup>30</sup> And he replied to him, “I am not going, but I am going to my own land and to my relatives.”

<sup>31</sup> Then he said, “Please do not leave us, because you know how we are to camp in the wilderness, and you shall be our eyes.

<sup>32</sup> “And it shall be, when you go with us, then it shall be that whatever good יהוה does to us, the same we shall do to you.”

<sup>33</sup> So they set out from the mountain of יהוה on a journey of three days. And the ark of the covenant of יהוה went before them for the three days’ journey, to seek out a resting place for them.

<sup>34</sup> And the cloud of יהוה was above them by day when they went out from the camp.

<sup>35</sup> And it came to be, whenever the ark set out, that Mosheh said, “Rise up, O יהוה ! And let Your enemies be scattered, and let those who hate You flee before You.”

<sup>36</sup> And when it rested, he said, “Return, O יהוה, to the countless thousands of Yisra’ĕl.”
