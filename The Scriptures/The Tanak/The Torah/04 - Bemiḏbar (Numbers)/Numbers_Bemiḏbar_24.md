<sup>1</sup> And when Bil‛am saw that it pleased יהוה to bless Yisra’ĕl, he did not go as at other times, to seek to use sorcery, but he set his face toward the wilderness.

<sup>2</sup> And Bil‛am lifted up his eyes and saw Yisra’ĕl encamped according to their tribes. And the Spirit of Elohim came upon him.

<sup>3</sup> And he took up his proverb and said, “The saying of Bil‛am, son of Be‛or, and the saying of the man whose eyes are opened,

<sup>4</sup> the saying of him who hears the words of Ĕl, who sees the vision of the Almighty, who falls down, with eyes opened wide:

<sup>5</sup> “How good are your tents, O Ya‛aqoḇ, your dwellings, O Yisra’ĕl!

<sup>6</sup> “Like wadis that stretch out, like gardens by a river, like aloes planted by יהוה, like cedars beside waters.

<sup>7</sup> “He makes water flow from his buckets, and his seed is in many waters. His sovereign is higher than Aḡaḡ, and his reign is exalted.

<sup>8</sup> “Ĕl who brought him out of Mitsrayim is for them like the horns of a wild ox; he devours nations, his enemies; and he breaks their bones, and with his arrows he smites.

<sup>9</sup> “He bowed down, he lay down like a lion. And, like a lion, who would rouse him? Blessed is he who blesses you, and cursed is he who curses you.”

<sup>10</sup> Then the displeasure of Balaq burned against Bil‛am, and he struck his hands together. Balaq then said to Bil‛am, “I summoned you to curse my enemies, and see, you have kept on blessing, these three times!

<sup>11</sup> “And now flee to your place. I said I would greatly esteem you, and see, יהוה has kept you back from esteem.”

<sup>12</sup> And Bil‛am said to Balaq, “Did I not also speak to your messengers whom you sent to me, saying,

<sup>13</sup> ‘If Balaq should give me his house filled with silver and gold, I am unable to go beyond the word of יהוה, to do either good or evil of my own heart. What יהוה speaks, that I speak’?

<sup>14</sup> “And now, see, I am going to my people. Come, let me advise you what this people is going to do to your people in the latter days.”

<sup>15</sup> And he took up his proverb and said, “The saying of Bil‛am, son of Be‛or, and the saying of the man whose eyes are opened,

<sup>16</sup> the saying of him who hears the words of Ĕl, and knows the knowledge of the Most High, who sees the vision of the Almighty, who falls down, with eyes opened wide:

<sup>17</sup> “I see Him, but not now; I observe Him, but not near. A Star shall come out of Ya‛aqoḇ, and a Sceptre shall rise out of Yisra’ĕl, and shall smite the corners of Mo’aḇ, and shall destroy all the sons of Shĕth.

<sup>18</sup> “And Eḏom shall be a possession; and Sĕ‛ir shall be a possession – enemies – and Yisra’ĕl is doing mightily.

<sup>19</sup> “And out of Ya‛aqoḇ One shall rule and destroy the remnant from Ar.”

<sup>20</sup> He then looked on Amalĕq, and he took up his proverb and said, “Amalĕq was first among the nations, but his latter end is to perish forever.”

<sup>21</sup> He then looked on the Qĕynites, and he took up his proverb and said, “Firm is your dwelling place, and your nest is set in the rock,

<sup>22</sup> but Qayin is to be burned. Till when does Asshur keep you captive?”

<sup>23</sup> And he took up his proverb and said, “Oh, who does live when Ĕl does this?

<sup>24</sup> And ships shall come from the coast of Kittim, and they shall afflict Asshur and afflict Ĕḇer, and so shall Amalĕq, and he also perishes.”

<sup>25</sup> And Bil‛am arose and left, and returned to his place. And Balaq also went his way.

<sup>1</sup> And when Bil‛am saw that it pleased יהוה to bless Yisra’ĕl, he did not go as at other times, to seek to use sorcery, but he set his face toward the wilderness.
