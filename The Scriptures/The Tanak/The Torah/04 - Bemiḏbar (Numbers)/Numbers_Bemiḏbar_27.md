<sup>1</sup> Then came the daughters of Tselophḥaḏ, son of Ḥĕpher, son of Gil‛aḏ, son of Maḵir, son of Menashsheh, from the clans of Menashsheh, son of Yosĕph. And these were the names of his daughters: Maḥlah, No‛ah, and Ḥoḡlah, and Milkah, and Tirtsah.

<sup>2</sup> And they stood before Mosheh, and before El‛azar the priest, and before the leaders and all the congregation, by the doorway of the Tent of Meeting, saying,

<sup>3</sup> “Our father died in the wilderness, yet he was not in the company of those who were met together against יהוה, in company with Qoraḥ, but he died in his own sin. And he had no sons.

<sup>4</sup> “Why should the name of our father be removed from among his clan because he had no son? Give us a possession among the brothers of our father.”

<sup>5</sup> Mosheh then brought their case before יהוה.

<sup>6</sup> And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,

<sup>7</sup> “The daughters of Tselophḥaḏ speak what is right. You should certainly give them a possession of inheritance among their father’s brothers, and cause the inheritance of their father to pass to them.

<sup>8</sup> “And speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl, saying, ‘When a man dies and has no son, then you shall cause his inheritance to pass to his daughter.

<sup>9</sup> ‘And if he has no daughter, then you shall give his inheritance to his brothers.

<sup>10</sup> ‘And if he has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his father’s brothers.

<sup>11</sup> ‘And if his father has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to the nearest relative in his clan, and he shall possess it.’ ” And it shall be to the children of Yisra’ĕl a law of right-ruling, as יהוה commanded Mosheh.

<sup>12</sup> And יהוה said to Mosheh, “Go up into this Mount Aḇarim, and see the land which I have given to the children of Yisra’ĕl.

<sup>13</sup> “And when you have seen it, you also shall be gathered to your people as Aharon your brother was gathered,

<sup>14</sup> because you rebelled against My mouth in the Wilderness of Tsin, in the strife of the congregation, to set Me apart at the waters before their eyes.” These were the waters of Meriḇah, at Qaḏĕsh in the Wilderness of Tsin.

<sup>15</sup> And Mosheh spoke to יהוה, saying,

<sup>16</sup> “Let יהוה, the Elohim of the spirits of all flesh, appoint a man over the congregation,

<sup>17</sup> who goes out before them and comes in before them, who leads them out and brings them in, so that the congregation of יהוה be not like sheep without a shepherd.”

<sup>18</sup> And יהוה said to Mosheh, “Take Yehoshua son of Nun with you, a man in whom is the Spirit. And you shall lay your hand on him,

<sup>19</sup> and shall set him before El‛azar the priest and before all the congregation, and give him charge before their eyes,

<sup>20</sup> and shall put some of your esteem upon him, so that all the congregation of the children of Yisra’ĕl obey him.

<sup>21</sup> “And he is to stand before El‛azar the priest, who shall inquire before יהוה for him by the right-ruling of the Urim. At his word they go out, and at his word they come in, both he and all the children of Yisra’ĕl with him, all the congregation.”

<sup>22</sup> And Mosheh did as יהוה commanded him, and took Yehoshua and set him before El‛azar the priest and before all the congregation,

<sup>23</sup> and laid his hands on him and commissioned him, as יהוה commanded by the hand of Mosheh.
