<sup>1</sup> And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, and to Aharon, saying,

<sup>2</sup> “Take a census of the sons of Qehath from among the children of Lĕwi, by their clans, by their fathers’ house,

<sup>3</sup> from thirty years old and above, even to fifty years old, all who enter the service to do the work in the Tent of Meeting.

<sup>4</sup> “This is the service of the sons of Qehath in the Tent of Meeting, the most set-apart matters:

<sup>5</sup> “At the breaking of camp, Aharon and his sons shall come, and they shall take down the covering veil and cover the ark of the Witness with it,

<sup>6</sup> and shall put on it a covering of fine leather, and spread over that an all-blue wrapper, and shall insert its poles.

<sup>7</sup> “And on the table of showbread they shall spread a blue wrapper, and shall put on it the dishes, and the ladles, and the bowls, and the jars for pouring, and the showbread on it.

<sup>8</sup> “And they shall spread over them a scarlet wrapper, and cover the same with a covering of fine leather, and shall insert its poles,

<sup>9</sup> and shall take a blue wrapper and cover the lampstand of the light, with its lamps, and its snuffers, and its trays, and all its oil vessels, by which they serve it.

<sup>10</sup> “And they shall put it with all its utensils in a covering of fine leather, and put it on a bar.

<sup>11</sup> “And over the golden altar they shall spread a blue wrapper, and cover it with a covering of fine leather, and shall insert its poles,

<sup>12</sup> and shall take all the utensils of service with which they serve in the set-apart place, and shall put them in a blue wrapper, cover them with a covering of fine leather, and put them on a bar,

<sup>13</sup> and shall remove the ashes from the altar, and spread a purple wrapper over it,

<sup>14</sup> and shall put on it all its utensils by which they serve there: the fire holders, the forks, and the shovels, and the basins, and all the utensils of the altar, and shall spread on it a covering of fine leather, and insert its poles.

<sup>15</sup> “And when Aharon and his sons have finished covering the set-apart objects and all the furnishings of the Set-apart Place at the breaking of camp, then the sons of Qehath shall come to lift them, but let them not touch that which is set-apart, lest they die. These matters are the burden of the sons of Qehath in the Tent of Meeting.

<sup>16</sup> “And the oversight of El‛azar, son of Aharon the priest, is the oil for the light, and the sweet incense, and the daily grain offering, and the anointing oil, and the oversight of all the Dwelling Place and all that is in it, with the set-apart place and its furnishings.”

<sup>17</sup> And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, and to Aharon, saying,

<sup>18</sup> “Do not cut off the tribe of the clans of the Qehathites from among the Lĕwites,

<sup>19</sup> but do this to them, and they shall live and not die when they approach the most set-apart objects: Aharon and his sons shall go in and appoint each of them to his service and his burden.

<sup>20</sup> “They are not, however, to go in to watch while the set-apart objects are being covered, lest they die.”

<sup>21</sup> And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,

<sup>22</sup> “Take a census also of the sons of Gĕreshon, by their fathers’ house, by their clans.

<sup>23</sup> “Register them, from thirty years old and above, even to fifty years old, all who enter to perform the service, to do the service in the Tent of Meeting.

<sup>24</sup> “This is the service of the clans of the Gĕreshonites, in serving and in bearing burdens:

<sup>25</sup> “And they shall bear the curtains of the Dwelling Place and the Tent of Meeting with its covering, the covering of fine leather that is on it, the covering for the door of the Tent of Meeting,

<sup>26</sup> and the screens of the courtyard and the covering for the door of the gate of the courtyard, which is around the Dwelling Place and altar, and their cords, all the equipment for their service and all that is made for them – so shall they serve.

<sup>27</sup> “Aharon and his sons are to command all the service of the sons of the Gĕreshonites, all their burden and all their service. And you shall appoint to them all the duty of all their burden.

<sup>28</sup> “This is the service of the clans of the sons of Gĕreshon in the Tent of Meeting. And let their duties be under the hand of Ithamar, son of Aharon the priest.

<sup>29</sup> “As for the sons of Merari, register them by their clans and by their fathers’ house.

<sup>30</sup> “Register them, from thirty years old and above, even to fifty years old, all who enter the service to do the work of the Tent of Meeting.

<sup>31</sup> “And this is the duty of their burden, according to all their service for the Tent of Meeting: the boards of the Dwelling Place, and its bars, and its columns, and its sockets,
