<sup>1</sup> Now Miryam and Aharon spoke against Mosheh because of the Kushite woman whom he had taken, for he had taken a Kushite woman.

<sup>2</sup> And they said, “Has יהוה spoken only through Mosheh? Has He not also spoken through us?” And יהוה heard it.

<sup>3</sup> And the man Mosheh was very humble, more than all men who were on the face of the earth.

<sup>4</sup> And suddenly יהוה said to Mosheh, and Aharon, and Miryam, “You three, come out to the Tent of Meeting!” So the three came out.

<sup>5</sup> And יהוה came down in the column of cloud and stood in the door of the Tent, and called Aharon and Miryam. And they both went forward.

<sup>6</sup> And He said, “Hear now My words: If your prophet is of יהוה, I make Myself known to him in a vision, and I speak to him in a dream.

<sup>7</sup> “Not so with My servant Mosheh, he is trustworthy in all My house.

<sup>8</sup> “I speak with him mouth to mouth, and plainly, and not in riddles. And he sees the form of יהוה. So why were you not afraid to speak against My servant Mosheh?”

<sup>9</sup> And the displeasure of יהוה burned against them, and He left.

<sup>10</sup> And the cloud turned away from above the Tent, and look: Miryam was leprous, as white as snow! And Aharon turned toward Miryam, and look: a leper!

<sup>11</sup> And Aharon said to Mosheh, “Oh, my master! Please do not hold against us the sin in which we have done foolishly and in which we have sinned.

<sup>12</sup> “Please do not let her be as one dead when coming out of its mother’s womb, with our flesh half consumed!”

<sup>13</sup> And Mosheh cried out to יהוה, saying, “O Ĕl, please heal her, please!”

<sup>14</sup> And יהוה said to Mosheh, “If her father had but spit in her face, would she not be ashamed seven days? Let her be shut out of the camp seven days, and after that let her be readmitted.”

<sup>15</sup> And Miryam was shut out of the camp seven days, and the people did not set out until Miryam was readmitted.

<sup>16</sup> And afterward the people departed from Ḥatsĕroth, and they camped in the Wilderness of Paran.
