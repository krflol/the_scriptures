<sup>1</sup> And יהוה spoke to Mosheh in the Wilderness of Sinai, in the Tent of Meeting, on the first day of the second month, in the second year after they had come out of the land of Mitsrayim, saying,

<sup>2</sup> “Take a census of all the congregation of the children of Yisra’ĕl, by their clans, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of names, every male, head by head,

<sup>3</sup> from twenty years old and above, everyone going out to the army in Yisra’ĕl. Number them by their divisions, you and Aharon.

<sup>4</sup> “And a man from every tribe should be with you, each one the head of his father’s house.

<sup>46</sup> all those that were registered were six hundred and three thousand five hundred and fifty.

<sup>47</sup> But the Lĕwites were not registered among them by their fathers’ tribe,

<sup>48</sup> because יהוה had spoken to Mosheh, saying,

<sup>49</sup> “Only the tribe of Lĕwi you do not register, nor take a census of them among the children of Yisra’ĕl.

<sup>50</sup> “Instead, appoint the Lĕwites over the Dwelling Place of the Witness, over all its furnishings, and over all that belongs to it. They bear the Dwelling Place and all its furnishings, and they attend to it, and camp around the Dwelling Place.

<sup>51</sup> “And when the Dwelling Place is to go forward, the Lĕwites take it down. And when the Dwelling Place is to be set up, the Lĕwites set it up. And the stranger who comes near is put to death.

<sup>52</sup> “And the children of Yisra’ĕl shall pitch their tents, everyone by his own camp, everyone by his own banner, according to their divisions,

<sup>53</sup> but let the Lĕwites camp around the Dwelling Place of the Witness, so that there be no wrath on the congregation of the children of Yisra’ĕl. And the Lĕwites shall guard the duty of the Dwelling Place of the Witness.”

<sup>54</sup> And the children of Yisra’ĕl did according to all that יהוה commanded Mosheh, so they did.
