<sup>1</sup> And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,

<sup>2</sup> “Send men to spy out the land of Kena‛an, which I am giving to the children of Yisra’ĕl. Send one man from each tribe of their fathers, every one a leader among them.”

<sup>3</sup> And by the command of יהוה Mosheh sent them from the Wilderness of Paran, all of them men who were heads of the children of Yisra’ĕl.

<sup>4</sup> And these were their names. From the tribe of Re’uḇĕn: Shammua, son of Zakkur.

<sup>5</sup> From the tribe of Shim‛on: Shaphat, son of Ḥori.

<sup>6</sup> From the tribe of Yehuḏah: Kalĕḇ, son of Yephunneh.

<sup>7</sup> From the tribe of Yissasḵar: Yiḡ’al, son of Yosĕph.

<sup>8</sup> From the tribe of Ephrayim: Hoshĕa, son of Nun.

<sup>9</sup> From the tribe of Binyamin: Palti, son of Raphu.

<sup>10</sup> From the tribe of Zeḇulun: Gaddi’ĕl, son of Soḏi.

<sup>11</sup> From the tribe of Yosĕph, from the tribe of Menashsheh: Gaddi, son of Susi.

<sup>12</sup> From the tribe of Dan: Ammi’ĕl, son of Gemalli.

<sup>13</sup> From the tribe of Ashĕr: Shĕthur, son of Miḵa’ĕl.

<sup>14</sup> From the tribe of Naphtali: Naḥbi, son of Wophsi.

<sup>15</sup> From the tribe of Gaḏ: Geu’ĕl, son of Maḵi.

<sup>16</sup> These are the names of the men whom Mosheh sent to spy out the land. And Mosheh called Hoshĕa the son of Nun, Yehoshua.

<sup>17</sup> And Mosheh sent them to spy out the land of Kena‛an, and said to them, “Go up here into the South, and go up to the mountains,

<sup>18</sup> and see what the land is like, and the people who dwell in it, whether strong or weak, whether few or many,

<sup>19</sup> and whether the land they dwell in is good or evil, whether the cities they inhabit are in camps or strongholds,

<sup>20</sup> and whether the land is rich or poor, and whether there are forests there or not. And you shall be strong, and bring some of the fruit of the land.” Now the time was the season of the first-fruits of grapes.

<sup>21</sup> So they went up and spied out the land from the Wilderness of Tsin as far as Reḥoḇ, near the entrance of Ḥamath.

<sup>22</sup> And they went up through the South and came to Ḥeḇron. And Aḥiman, Shĕshai, and Talmai, the descendants of Anaq, were there. Now Ḥeḇron had been built seven years before Tso‛an in Mitsrayim.

<sup>23</sup> And they came to the wadi Eshkol, and cut down from there a branch with one cluster of grapes. And they bore it between two of them on a pole, also of the pomegranates and of the figs.

<sup>24</sup> That place was called the wadi Eshkol, because of the cluster which the men of Yisra’ĕl cut down from there.

<sup>25</sup> And they returned from spying out the land after forty days.

<sup>26</sup> And they went and came to Mosheh and Aharon and all the congregation of the children of Yisra’ĕl in the Wilderness of Paran, at Qaḏĕsh. And they brought back word to them and to all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land.

<sup>27</sup> And they reported to him, and said, “We went to the land where you sent us. And truly, it flows with milk and honey, and this is its fruit.

<sup>28</sup> “But the people who dwell in the land are strong, and the cities are walled, very great. And we saw the descendants of Anaq there too.

<sup>29</sup> “The Amalĕqites dwell in the land of the South, while the Ḥittites and the Yeḇusites and the Amorites dwell in the mountains. And the Kena‛anites dwell by the sea and along the banks of the Yardĕn.”

<sup>30</sup> And Kalĕḇ silenced the people before Mosheh, and said, “Let us go up at once and take possession, for we are certainly able to overcome it.”

<sup>31</sup> But the men who had gone up with him said, “We are not able to go up against the people, for they are stronger than we.”

<sup>32</sup> And they gave the children of Yisra’ĕl an evil report of the land which they had spied out, saying, “The land through which we have gone as spies is a land eating up its inhabitants, and all the people whom we saw in it are men of great size.

<sup>33</sup> “And we saw there the Nephilim, sons of Anaq, of the Nephilim. And we were like grasshoppers in our own eyes, and so we were in their eyes.”

<sup>1</sup> And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,

<sup>2</sup> “Send men to spy out the land of Kena‛an, which I am giving to the children of Yisra’ĕl. Send one man from each tribe of their fathers, every one a leader among them.”
