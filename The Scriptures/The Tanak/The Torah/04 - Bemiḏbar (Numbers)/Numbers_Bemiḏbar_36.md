<sup>1</sup> And the heads of the fathers of the clans of the children of Gil‛aḏ, son of Maḵir, son of Menashsheh, of the clans of the sons of Yosĕph, came near and spoke before Mosheh and before the leaders, the heads of the fathers of the children of Yisra’ĕl,

<sup>2</sup> and said, “ יהוה commanded my master to give the land as an inheritance by lot to the children of Yisra’ĕl, and my master was commanded by יהוה to give the inheritance of our brother Tselophḥaḏ to his daughters.

<sup>3</sup> “Now if they are married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of Yisra’ĕl, then their inheritance shall be taken from the inheritance of our fathers, and shall be added to the inheritance of the tribe into which they marry, and taken from the lot of our inheritance.

<sup>4</sup> “And if the Jubilee of the children of Yisra’ĕl takes place, then their inheritance shall be added to the inheritance of the tribe into which they marry, and their inheritance taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.”

<sup>5</sup> And Mosheh commanded the children of Yisra’ĕl according to the word of יהוה, saying, “What the tribe of the sons of Yosĕph speaks is right.

<sup>6</sup> “This is the word which יהוה has commanded, for the daughters of Tselophḥaḏ, saying, ‘Let them marry who is good in their eyes, but let them marry only within the clan of their father’s tribe.’

<sup>7</sup> “And the inheritance of the children of Yisra’ĕl is not to change hands from tribe to tribe, for every one of the children of Yisra’ĕl is to cling to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.

<sup>8</sup> “And every daughter possessing an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Yisra’ĕl is to be the wife of one of the clan of her father’s tribe, so that the children of Yisra’ĕl possess each the inheritance of his fathers.

<sup>9</sup> “Thus the inheritance is not to change hands from one tribe to another, but every tribe of the children of Yisra’ĕl is to cling to its own inheritance.”

<sup>10</sup> As יהוה commanded Mosheh, so did the daughters of Tselophḥaḏ.

<sup>11</sup> For Maḥlah, Tirtsah, and Ḥoḡlah, and Milkah, and No‛ah, the daughters of Tselophḥaḏ, were married to the sons of their father’s brothers.

<sup>12</sup> And they were married into the clans of the children of Menashsheh, the son of Yosĕph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of their father’s clan.

<sup>13</sup> These are the commands and the right-rulings which יהוה commanded the children of Yisra’ĕl by the hand of Mosheh in the desert plains of Mo’aḇ by the Yardĕn of Yeriḥo.
