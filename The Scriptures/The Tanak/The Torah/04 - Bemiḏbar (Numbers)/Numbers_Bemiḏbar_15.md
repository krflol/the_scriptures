<sup>1</sup> And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,

<sup>2</sup> “Speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl, and say to them, ‘When you have come into the land of your dwellings, which I am giving you,

<sup>3</sup> and you make an offering by fire to יהוה, a burnt offering or a slaughtering, to accomplish a vow or as a voluntary offering or in your appointed times, to make a sweet fragrance to יהוה, from the herd or the flock,

<sup>4</sup> then he who brings near his offering to יהוה shall bring near a grain offering of one-tenth of an ĕphah of fine flour mixed with one-fourth of a hin of oil,

<sup>5</sup> and one-fourth of a hin of wine as a drink offering you prepare with the burnt offering or the slaughtering, for each lamb.

<sup>6</sup> ‘Or for a ram you prepare as a grain offering two-tenths of an ĕphah of fine flour mixed with one-third of a hin of oil,

<sup>7</sup> and as a drink offering you bring one-third of a hin of wine as a sweet fragrance to יהוה.

<sup>8</sup> ‘And when you prepare a young bull as a burnt offering, or as a slaughtering to accomplish a vow, or as a peace offering to יהוה,

<sup>9</sup> then shall be brought with the young bull a grain offering of three-tenths of an ĕphah of fine flour mixed with half a hin of oil,

<sup>10</sup> and bring as the drink offering half a hin of wine as an offering made by fire, a sweet fragrance to יהוה.

<sup>11</sup> ‘This is what is done for each young bull, for each ram, or for each lamb or young goat.

<sup>12</sup> ‘According to the number that you prepare, so you do for each one according to their number.

<sup>13</sup> ‘Let all who are native do so with them, in bringing near an offering made by fire, a sweet fragrance to יהוה.

<sup>14</sup> ‘And when a stranger sojourns with you, or whoever is among you throughout your generations, and would make an offering made by fire, a sweet fragrance to יהוה, as you do, so he does.

<sup>15</sup> ‘One law is for you of the assembly and for the stranger who sojourns with you – a law forever throughout your generations. As you are, so is the stranger before יהוה.

<sup>16</sup> ‘One Torah and one right-ruling is for you and for the stranger who sojourns with you.’ ”

<sup>17</sup> And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,

<sup>18</sup> “Speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl, and say to them, ‘When you come into the land to which I bring you,

<sup>19</sup> then it shall be, when you eat of the bread of the land, that you present a contribution to יהוה.

<sup>20</sup> ‘Present a cake of the first of your dough as a contribution – as a contribution of the threshing-floor you present it.

<sup>21</sup> ‘Of the first of your dough you are to give to יהוה a contribution throughout your generations.

<sup>22</sup> ‘And when you sin by mistake, and do not do all these commands which יהוה has spoken to Mosheh,

<sup>23</sup> all that יהוה has commanded you by the hand of Mosheh, from the day יהוה gave command and onward throughout your generations,

<sup>24</sup> then it shall be, if it is done by mistake, without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall prepare one young bull as a burnt offering, as a sweet fragrance to יהוה, with its grain offering and its drink offering, according to the right-ruling, and one male goat as a sin offering.

<sup>25</sup> ‘Then the priest shall make atonement for all the congregation of the children of Yisra’ĕl, and it shall be forgiven them, for it was by mistake. And they shall bring their offering, an offering made by fire to יהוה, and their sin offering before יהוה, for their mistake.

<sup>26</sup> ‘And it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the children of Yisra’ĕl and the stranger who sojourns in their midst, because all the people did it by mistake.

<sup>27</sup> ‘And if a being sins by mistake, then he shall bring a female goat a year old as a sin offering.

<sup>28</sup> ‘And the priest shall make atonement for the being who strays by mistake, when he sins by mistake before יהוה, to make atonement for him, and it shall be forgiven him.

<sup>29</sup> ‘For him who does whatever by mistake there is one Torah, both for him who is native among the children of Yisra’ĕl and for the stranger who sojourns in their midst.

<sup>30</sup> ‘But the being who does whatever defiantly, whether he is native or a stranger, he reviles יהוה, and that being shall be cut off from among his people.

<sup>31</sup> ‘Because he has despised the word of יהוה, and has broken His command, that being shall certainly be cut off, his crookedness is upon him.’ ”

<sup>32</sup> And while the children of Yisra’ĕl were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering sticks on the Sabbath day.

<sup>33</sup> And those who found him gathering sticks brought him to Mosheh and to Aharon, and to all the congregation.

<sup>34</sup> And they put him in under guard, because it had not been declared what should be done to him.

<sup>35</sup> And יהוה said to Mosheh, “The man shall certainly be put to death, all the congregation stoning him with stones outside the camp.”

<sup>36</sup> And all the congregation brought him outside the camp and stoned him with stones, as יהוה commanded Mosheh, and he died.

<sup>37</sup> And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,

<sup>38</sup> “Speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl, and you shall say to them to make tzitziyot on the corners of their garments throughout their generations, and to put a blue cord in the tzitzit of the corners.

<sup>39</sup> “And it shall be to you for a tzitzit, and you shall see it, and shall remember all the commands of יהוה and shall do them, and not search after your own heart and your own eyes after which you went whoring,

<sup>40</sup> so that you remember, and shall do all My commands, and be set-apart unto your Elohim.

<sup>41</sup> “I am יהוה your Elohim, who brought you out of the land of Mitsrayim, to be your Elohim. I am יהוה your Elohim.”
