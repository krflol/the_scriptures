<sup>1</sup> And it came to be, when the people were as complainers, it was evil in the ears of יהוה. And יהוה heard it, and His displeasure burned. And the fire of יהוה burned among them, and consumed those in the outskirts of the camp.

<sup>2</sup> And the people cried out to Mosheh, and Mosheh prayed to יהוה, and the fire died down.

<sup>3</sup> Then he called the name of the place Taḇ‛ĕrah, because the fire of יהוה had burned among them.

<sup>4</sup> And the mixed multitude who were in their midst lusted greatly, so the children of Yisra’ĕl also wept again and said, “Who is giving us meat to eat?

<sup>5</sup> “We remember the fish which we ate without cost in Mitsrayim, the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic,

<sup>6</sup> but now our throat is dried up. There is naught to look at but this manna!”

<sup>7</sup> Now the manna was like coriander seed, and its appearance like the appearance of bdellium.

<sup>8</sup> The people went about and gathered it, ground it on millstones or beat it in the mortar, and cooked it in a pot, and made cakes of it. And its taste was as the taste of cakes baked with oil.

<sup>9</sup> And when the dew fell on the camp at night, the manna fell on it.

<sup>10</sup> And Mosheh heard the people weeping throughout their clans, each man at the door of his tent. And the displeasure of יהוה burned exceedingly. And in the eyes of Mosheh it was evil,

<sup>11</sup> so Mosheh said to יהוה, “Why have You done evil to Your servant? And why have I not found favour in Your eyes, to put the burden of all these people on me?

<sup>12</sup> “Was it I who conceived all these people? Was it I who brought them forth, that You should say to me, ‘Carry them in your bosom, as the foster father carries a nursing child,’ to the land which You swore to their fathers?

<sup>13</sup> “Where am I to get meat to give to all these people? For they weep before me, saying, ‘Give us meat to eat.’

<sup>14</sup> “I am unable to bear all these people alone, because the burden is too heavy for me.

<sup>15</sup> “And if You are doing this to me, please slay me altogether, if I have found favour in Your eyes, and let me not see my evil!”

<sup>16</sup> Then יהוה said to Mosheh, “Gather to Me seventy men of the elders of Yisra’ĕl, whom you know to be the elders of the people and officers over them. And bring them to the Tent of Meeting, and let them stand there with you.

<sup>17</sup> “And I shall come down and speak with you there, and shall take of the Spirit that is on you, and put on them. And they shall bear the burden of the people with you, so that you do not bear it yourself alone.

<sup>18</sup> “And say to the people, ‘Set yourselves apart for tomorrow, and you shall eat meat, because you have wept in the hearing of יהוה, saying, “Who is giving us meat to eat? For it was well with us in Mitsrayim.” And יהוה shall give you meat, and you shall eat.

<sup>19</sup> ‘You are going to eat, not one day, nor two days, nor five days, nor ten days, nor twenty days,

<sup>20</sup> but for a month of days, until it comes out of your nostrils and becomes an abomination to you, because you have rejected יהוה who is among you, and have wept before Him, saying, “Why did we come up out of Mitsrayim?” ’ ”

<sup>21</sup> And Mosheh said, “The people in whose midst I am are six hundred thousand men on foot, and You, You have said, ‘I give them meat to eat for a month of days.’

<sup>22</sup> “Could flocks and herds be slaughtered for them, to be sufficient for them? Or could all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to be sufficient for them?”

<sup>23</sup> And יהוה said to Mosheh, “Is the arm of יהוה too short? Now see whether My word meets you or not!”

<sup>24</sup> And Mosheh went out and spoke to the people the words of יהוה, and he gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people and placed them around the Tent.

<sup>25</sup> And יהוה came down in the cloud, and spoke to him, and took of the Spirit that was upon him, and placed the same upon the seventy elders. And it came to be, when the Spirit rested upon them, that they prophesied, but did not continue.

<sup>26</sup> However, two men had remained in the camp. The name of one was Eldaḏ, and the name of the other Mĕyḏaḏ. And the Spirit rested upon them. Now they were among those listed, but did not go out to the Tent. And they prophesied in the camp.

<sup>27</sup> And a young man ran and informed Mosheh, and said, “Eldaḏ and Mĕyḏaḏ are prophesying in the camp.”

<sup>28</sup> And Yehoshua son of Nun, Mosheh’s assistant from his youth, answered and said, “Mosheh my master, forbid them!”

<sup>29</sup> Then Mosheh said to him, “Are you jealous for my sake? Oh, that all the people of יהוה were prophets, that יהוה would put His Spirit upon them!”

<sup>30</sup> And Mosheh returned to the camp, both he and the elders of Yisra’ĕl.

<sup>31</sup> And a wind went forth from יהוה, and it brought quail from the sea and let them fall beside the camp, about a day’s journey on this side and about a day’s journey on the other side, all around the camp, and about two cubits above the surface of the ground.

<sup>32</sup> And the people were up all that day, and all that night, and all the next day, and gathered the quail. He who has least gathered ten ḥomers. And they spread them out for themselves all around the camp.

<sup>33</sup> The meat was still between their teeth, before it was chewed, and the wrath of יהוה burned against the people, and יהוה smote the people with an exceeding great plague.

<sup>34</sup> Then he called the name of that place Qiḇroth Hatta’awah, because there they buried the people who had lusted.

<sup>35</sup> From Qiḇroth Hatta’awah the people set out for Ḥatsĕroth – and they were at Ḥatsĕroth.

<sup>1</sup> And it came to be, when the people were as complainers, it was evil in the ears of יהוה. And יהוה heard it, and His displeasure burned. And the fire of יהוה burned among them, and consumed those in the outskirts of the camp.
