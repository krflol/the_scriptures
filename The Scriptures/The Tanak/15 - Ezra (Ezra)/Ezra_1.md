<sup>1</sup> And in the first year of Koresh sovereign of Persia, that the word of יהוה by the mouth of Yirmeyah might be accomplished, יהוה stirred up the spirit of Koresh sovereign of Persia, to proclaim throughout all his reign, and also in writing, saying,
<sup>2</sup> “Thus said Koresh sovereign of Persia, ‘ יהוה Elohim of the heavens has given me all the reigns of the earth. And He has commanded me to build Him a house in Yerushalayim which is in Yehuḏah.
<sup>3</sup> Who is among you of all His people? His Elohim be with him! And let him go up to Yerushalayim, which is in Yehuḏah, and build the House of יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl – He is Elohim – which is in Yerushalayim.
<sup>4</sup> And whoever is left from all the places where he sojourns, let the men of his place help him with silver and gold, with goods and livestock, besides the voluntary offerings for the House of Elohim which is in Yerushalayim.’ ”
<sup>5</sup> And the heads of the fathers’ houses of Yehuḏah and Binyamin, and the priests and the Lĕwites, with all those whose spirits Elohim had stirred, rose up to go up and build the House of יהוה which is in Yerushalayim.
<sup>6</sup> And all those round about them strengthened their hands with objects of silver and gold, with goods and livestock, and with valuables, besides all that was voluntarily offered.
<sup>7</sup> And Sovereign Koresh brought out the utensils of the House of יהוה, which Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar had taken from Yerushalayim and put in the house of his mighty ones,
<sup>8</sup> and Koresh sovereign of Persia brought them out by the hand of Mithreḏath the treasurer, and counted them out to Shĕshbatstsar the leader of Yehuḏah.
<sup>9</sup> And this was their number: thirty gold dishes, one thousand silver dishes, twenty-nine knives,
<sup>10</sup> thirty gold basins, next, four hundred and ten silver basins, one thousand other utensils.
<sup>11</sup> All the utensils of gold and silver were five thousand four hundred. Shĕshbatstsar took all of them with the exiles who were brought from Baḇel to Yerushalayim.
