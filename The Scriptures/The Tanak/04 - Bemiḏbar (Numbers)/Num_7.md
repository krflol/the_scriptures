<sup>1</sup> And it came to be, when Mosheh finished setting up the Dwelling Place, that he anointed it and set it apart and all its furnishings, as well as the altar and all its utensils. Thus he anointed them and set them apart.
<sup>2</sup> And the leaders of Yisra’ĕl, heads of their fathers’ houses who were the leaders of the tribes and over the ones registered, drew near,
<sup>3</sup> and they brought their offering before יהוה : six covered wagons and twelve cattle, a wagon for every two of the leaders, and for each one a bull. And they brought them near before the Dwelling Place.
<sup>4</sup> And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
<sup>5</sup> “Accept these from them, and they shall be used in doing the service of the Tent of Meeting. And you shall give them to the Lĕwites, each one according to his service.”
<sup>6</sup> And Mosheh took the wagons and the cattle, and gave them to the Lĕwites.

<sup>10</sup> And the leaders brought the dedication offering of the altar in the day it was anointed. So the leaders brought their offering before the altar.
