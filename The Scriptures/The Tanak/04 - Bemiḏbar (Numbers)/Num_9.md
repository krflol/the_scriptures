<sup>1</sup> And יהוה spoke to Mosheh in the Wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of Mitsrayim, saying,
<sup>2</sup> “Now, let the children of Yisra’ĕl perform the Passover at its appointed time.
<sup>3</sup> “On the fourteenth day of this month, between the evenings, perform it at its appointed time. According to all its laws and right-rulings you perform it.”
<sup>4</sup> And Mosheh spoke to the children of Yisra’ĕl to perform the Passover.
<sup>5</sup> So they performed the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month, between the evenings, in the Wilderness of Sinai. According to all that יהוה commanded Mosheh, so the children of Yisra’ĕl did.
<sup>6</sup> But there were men who were defiled for a being of a man, so that they were not able to perform the Passover on that day. So they came before Mosheh and Aharon that day,
<sup>7</sup> and those men said to him, “We are defiled for the being of a man. Why are we withheld from bringing near the offering of יהוה at its appointed time among the children of Yisra’ĕl?”
<sup>8</sup> And Mosheh said to them, “Wait, let me hear what יהוה commands concerning you.”
<sup>9</sup> And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
<sup>10</sup> “Speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl, saying, ‘When any male of you or your generations is unclean for a being, or is far away on a journey, he shall still perform the Passover of יהוה.
<sup>11</sup> ‘On the fourteenth day of the second month, between the evenings, they perform it – with unleavened bread and bitter herbs they eat it.
<sup>12</sup> ‘They do not leave of it until morning, and they do not break a bone of it. According to all the laws of the Passover they perform it.
<sup>13</sup> ‘But the man who is clean and is not on a journey, and has failed to perform the Passover, that same being shall be cut off from among his people, because he did not bring the offering of יהוה at its appointed time – that man bears his sin.
<sup>14</sup> ‘And when a stranger sojourns among you, then he shall perform the Passover of יהוה. He shall do so according to the law of the Passover and according to its right-ruling. You have one law, both for the stranger and the native of the land.’ ”
<sup>15</sup> And on the day that the Dwelling Place was raised up, the cloud covered the Dwelling Place, the Tent of the Witness. From evening until morning it was above the Dwelling Place like the appearance of fire.
<sup>16</sup> Thus it was continually: the cloud covered it by day, and the appearance of fire by night.
<sup>17</sup> And whenever the cloud was taken up from above the Tent, after that the children of Yisra’ĕl would depart. And in the place where the cloud dwelt, there the children of Yisra’ĕl would camp.
<sup>18</sup> At the command of יהוה the children of Yisra’ĕl departed, and at the command of יהוה they camped. They remained camped as long as the cloud dwelt above the Dwelling Place.
<sup>19</sup> Even when the cloud lingered many days above the Dwelling Place, the children of Yisra’ĕl guarded the Charge of יהוה, and did not depart.
<sup>20</sup> And so it was, when the cloud was above the Dwelling Place a few days: according to the command of יהוה they camped, and according to the command of יהוה they would depart.
<sup>21</sup> And so it was, when the cloud dwelt only from evening until morning: when the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they departed. Whether by day or by night, whenever the cloud was taken up, they departed.
<sup>22</sup> Whether two days, or a month, or a year that the cloud lingered above the Dwelling Place to dwell upon it, the children of Yisra’ĕl camped, and did not depart. But when it was taken up, they departed.
<sup>23</sup> At the command of יהוה they camped, and at the command of יהוה they departed. They guarded the Charge of יהוה, at the command of יהוה by the hand of Mosheh.
