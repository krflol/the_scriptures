<sup>1</sup> And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
<sup>2</sup> “Speak to Aharon, and say to him, ‘When you set up the lamps, let the seven lamps give light in front of the lampstand.’ ”
<sup>3</sup> And Aharon did so. He set up the lamps to face toward the front of the lampstand, as יהוה commanded Mosheh.
<sup>4</sup> And this is the work of the lampstand: beaten work of gold, from its base to its blossoms it is beaten work. According to the pattern which יהוה had shown Mosheh, so he made the lampstand.
<sup>5</sup> And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
<sup>6</sup> “Take the Lĕwites from among the children of Yisra’ĕl, and you shall cleanse them,
<sup>7</sup> and do this to them to cleanse them: Sprinkle water of sin offering on them, and they shall shave all their body, and shall wash their garments, and cleanse themselves,
<sup>8</sup> and shall take a young bull with its grain offering of fine flour mixed with oil, while you take another young bull as a sin offering.
<sup>9</sup> “And you shall bring the Lĕwites before the Tent of Meeting, and you shall assemble all the congregation of the children of Yisra’ĕl.
<sup>10</sup> “And you shall bring the Lĕwites before יהוה, and the children of Yisra’ĕl shall lay their hands on the Lĕwites,
<sup>11</sup> and Aharon shall wave the Lĕwites before יהוה, a wave offering from the children of Yisra’ĕl – so shall they be for doing the service of יהוה.
<sup>12</sup> “And the Lĕwites shall lay their hands on the heads of the young bulls. And one shall be prepared as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering to יהוה, to make atonement for the Lĕwites.
<sup>13</sup> “And you shall have the Lĕwites stand before Aharon and his sons, and then wave them, a wave offering to יהוה.
<sup>14</sup> “Thus you shall separate the Lĕwites from among the children of Yisra’ĕl, and the Lĕwites shall be Mine.
<sup>15</sup> “Then after that the Lĕwites shall go in to do service in the Tent of Meeting, when you have cleansed them and waved them as a wave offering.
<sup>16</sup> “For they are given ones, given to Me from among the children of Yisra’ĕl. I have taken them for Myself instead of all who open the womb, the first-born of all the children of Yisra’ĕl.
<sup>17</sup> “For all the first-born among the children of Yisra’ĕl are Mine, both man and beast. On the day that I smote all the first-born in the land of Mitsrayim I set them apart unto Myself.
<sup>18</sup> “And I have taken the Lĕwites instead of all the first-born of the children of Yisra’ĕl.
<sup>19</sup> “And I have given the Lĕwites as a gift to Aharon and his sons from among the children of Yisra’ĕl, to do the service of the children of Yisra’ĕl in the Tent of Meeting, and to make atonement for the children of Yisra’ĕl, that there be no plague among the children of Yisra’ĕl when the children of Yisra’ĕl come near the set-apart place.”
<sup>20</sup> Thus Mosheh and Aharon and all the congregation of the children of Yisra’ĕl did to the Lĕwites according to all that יהוה commanded Mosheh concerning the Lĕwites, so the children of Yisra’ĕl did to them.
<sup>21</sup> And the Lĕwites cleansed themselves and washed their garments, and Aharon waved them, a wave offering before יהוה, and Aharon made atonement for them to cleanse them.
<sup>22</sup> Then after that the Lĕwites went in to do their service in the Tent of Meeting before Aharon and his sons as יהוה commanded Mosheh concerning the Lĕwites, so they did to them.
<sup>23</sup> And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
<sup>24</sup> “This applies to the Lĕwites: From twenty-five years old and above let him come into active service in the service of the Tent of Meeting,
<sup>25</sup> and at the age of fifty years they retire from active service of the service, and serve no more,
<sup>26</sup> but they shall attend with their brothers in the Tent of Meeting, to guard the duty, but shall do no service. Thus you shall do to the Lĕwites regarding their duties.”
