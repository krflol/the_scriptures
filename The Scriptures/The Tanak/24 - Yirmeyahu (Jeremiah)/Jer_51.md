<sup>1</sup> Thus said יהוה, “See, I am stirring up the spirit of a destroyer against Baḇel, against those who dwell in Lĕb – My opponents.
<sup>2</sup> And I shall send winnowers to Baḇel, who shall winnow her and empty her land. For they shall be against her all around, in the day of evil.
<sup>3</sup> “Let the archer draw his bow, and let him stand ready in his armour. Do not spare her young men, put all her army under the ban.
<sup>4</sup> “And the slain shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans, and the pierced-through in her streets.
<sup>5</sup> “For neither Yisra’ĕl nor Yehuḏah is widowed by his Elohim, יהוה of hosts, though their land has been filled with sin against the Set-apart One of Yisra’ĕl.”
<sup>6</sup> Flee from the midst of Baḇel, and let each one save his life! Do not be cut off in her crookedness, for this is the time of the vengeance of יהוה, the recompense He is repaying her.
<sup>7</sup> Baḇel was a golden cup in the hand of יהוה, making drunk all the earth. The nations drank her wine, that is why the nations went mad!
<sup>8</sup> Baḇel shall suddenly fall and be broken. Howl for her! Take balm for her pain – if so be, she might be healed.
<sup>9</sup> We would have healed Baḇel, but she is not healed. Let us leave her and each go to his own land, for her judgment reaches to the heavens and is lifted up to the clouds.
<sup>10</sup> יהוה has brought forth our righteousness. Come and let us relate in Tsiyon the work of יהוה our Elohim.
<sup>11</sup> Polish the arrows! Put on the shields! יהוה has stirred up the spirit of the sovereigns of the Medes. For His plan is against Baḇel to destroy it, because it is the vengeance of יהוה, the vengeance for His Hĕḵal.
<sup>12</sup> Lift up a banner on the walls of Baḇel, strengthen the watch, station the watchmen, prepare the ambush. For יהוה has both planned and done what He spoke concerning the inhabitants of Baḇel.
<sup>13</sup> You who dwell upon many waters, great in treasures, your end has come, the measure of your greedy gain.
<sup>14</sup> יהוה of hosts has sworn by Himself, “I shall certainly fill you with men, as with locusts, and they shall lift up a shout against you.”
<sup>15</sup> He made the earth by His power, He established the world by His wisdom, and stretched out the heavens by His understanding.
<sup>16</sup> When He gives forth His voice the waters in the heavens roar, and He makes vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; He makes lightnings for the rain, and He brings the wind out of His treasuries.
<sup>17</sup> All mankind has become too brutish to know, every smith has been put to shame by the carved image, for his moulded image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.
<sup>18</sup> They are worthless, a work of mockery. In the time of their punishment they perish.
<sup>19</sup> The Portion of Ya‛aqoḇ is not like them, for He is the Maker of all, and Yisra’ĕl is the tribe of His inheritance. יהוה of hosts is His Name.
<sup>20</sup> “You are My battle-axe, weapons of battle, and with you I shall break nations in pieces, and with you I shall destroy reigns.
<sup>21</sup> “And with you I shall break in pieces the horse and its rider, and with you I shall break in pieces the chariot and its rider.
<sup>22</sup> “And with you I shall break in pieces man and woman, and with you I shall break in pieces old and young, and with you I shall break in pieces the young man and the maiden.
<sup>23</sup> “And with you I shall break in pieces the shepherd and his flock, and with you I shall break in pieces the farmer and his yoke of oxen. And with you I shall break in pieces governors and rulers.
<sup>24</sup> “And I shall repay Baḇel and all the inhabitants of Chaldea for all the evil they have done in Tsiyon before your eyes,” declares יהוה.
<sup>25</sup> “See, I am against you, O destroying mountain, who destroys all the earth,” declares יהוה. “And I shall stretch out My hand against you. And I shall roll you down from the rocks, and make you a burnt mountain.
<sup>26</sup> “And they shall not take from you a stone for a corner nor a stone for a foundation, but you shall be a waste forever,” declares יהוה.
<sup>27</sup> Lift up a banner in the land, blow the ram’s horn among the nations! Prepare the nations against her, call the reigns together against her: Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz. Appoint a commander against her, bring up horses like hairy locusts.
<sup>28</sup> Separate the nations against her, with the sovereigns of the Medes, its governors and all its rulers, all the land of his rule,
<sup>29</sup> so that the land shakes and writhes in pain. For every plan of יהוה shall be established against Baḇel, to make the land of Baḇel a ruin, without inhabitant.
<sup>30</sup> The mighty men of Baḇel have ceased to fight, they remained in their strongholds. Their might has failed, they became like women, they have burned her dwelling places. The bars of her gate have been broken.
<sup>31</sup> One runner runs to meet another, and one reporter to meet another, to report to the sovereign of Baḇel that his city is taken on all sides,
<sup>32</sup> and the fords have been captured, and they have burned the reeds with fire, and the soldiers are startled.
<sup>33</sup> For thus said יהוה of hosts, the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, “The daughter of Baḇel is like a threshing-floor at the time it is trodden. Yet a little while and the time of her harvest shall come.”
<sup>34</sup> “Neḇuḵaḏretstsar the sovereign of Baḇel has devoured us, he has crushed us, he has made us an empty vessel, he has swallowed us up like a monster. He has filled his stomach with my delicacies, he has driven us away.
<sup>35</sup> “Let the violence done to me and my flesh be upon Baḇel,” says the inhabitant of Tsiyon. And, “Let my blood be upon the inhabitants of Chaldea,” says Yerushalayim.
<sup>36</sup> Therefore thus said יהוה, “See, I am pleading your case. And I shall take vengeance for you and dry up her sea and make her fountain dry.
<sup>37</sup> “And Baḇel shall become a heap, a habitation of jackals, an astonishment and a hissing, without inhabitant.
<sup>38</sup> “Together they roar like lions, they shall growl like lions’ cubs.
<sup>39</sup> “In their heat I prepare their feasts. And I shall make them drunk, so that they rejoice, and sleep a neverending sleep and not awake,” declares יהוה.
<sup>40</sup> “I shall bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams with male goats.
<sup>41</sup> “Oh, how Shĕshaḵ has been captured, the praise of all the earth been seized! How Baḇel has become a ruin among the nations!
<sup>42</sup> “The sea has risen over Baḇel, she has been covered with the roaring of its waves.
<sup>43</sup> “Her cities have become a ruin, a dry land and a desert, a land where no one dwells, neither does son of man pass by it.
<sup>44</sup> “And I shall punish Bĕl in Baḇel. And I shall make him spew out what he has swallowed, and nations shall no longer stream to him. Even the wall of Baḇel shall fall.
<sup>45</sup> “Come out of her midst, My people! And let everyone deliver his being from the burning displeasure of יהוה.
<sup>46</sup> “And lest your heart grow faint, and you fear the report heard in the land – for a report shall come one year, and after that, in another year a report shall come, and violence in the land, ruler against ruler –
<sup>47</sup> therefore see, the days are coming that I shall bring punishment on the carved images of Baḇel, and all her land shall be put to shame, and all her slain fall in her midst.
<sup>48</sup> “And the heavens and the earth and all that is in them shall shout for joy over Baḇel, for the ravagers shall come to her from the north,” declares יהוה.
<sup>49</sup> As Baḇel is to fall for the slain of Yisra’ĕl, so for Baḇel the slain of all the earth shall fall.
<sup>50</sup> You who have escaped the sword, go away! Do not stand still! Remember יהוה from afar, and let Yerushalayim come to your heart.
<sup>51</sup> We are ashamed because we have heard reproach. Shame has covered our faces, for strangers have come into the set-apart places of the House of יהוה.
<sup>52</sup> “Therefore see, the days are coming,” declares יהוה, “that I shall bring punishment on her carved images, while the wounded groan throughout all her land.
<sup>53</sup> “Though Baḇel should mount up to the heavens, and though she should make the height of her strength inaccessible, ravagers shall come to her from Me,” declares יהוה.
<sup>54</sup> Listen! A cry from Baḇel, and great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans,
<sup>55</sup> because יהוה is ravaging Baḇel, and shall silence her loud voice. And her waves shall roar like great waters, the noise of their voice shall resound,
<sup>56</sup> because the ravager shall come against her, against Baḇel, and her mighty men shall be captured. Every one of their bows shall be broken, for יהוה is the Ĕl of recompense, He shall certainly repay.
<sup>57</sup> “And I shall make her rulers drunk, and her wise men, her governors, and her deputies, and her mighty men. And they shall sleep a lasting sleep, and not awake,” declares the Sovereign, whose Name is יהוה of hosts.
<sup>58</sup> Thus said יהוה of hosts, “The broad walls of Baḇel are completely demolished, and her high gates are burned with fire, and peoples labour in vain, and the nations weary themselves for fire.”
<sup>59</sup> The word that Yirmeyahu the prophet commanded Serayah son of Nĕriyah, son of Maḥsĕyah, when he went with Tsiḏqiyahu the sovereign of Yehuḏah to Baḇel in the fourth year of his reign. And Serayah was a quartermaster.
<sup>60</sup> So Yirmeyahu wrote in a book all the evil that would come upon Baḇel, all these words which have been written concerning Baḇel.
<sup>61</sup> And Yirmeyahu said to Serayah, “When you come to Baḇel and see it, and read all these words,
<sup>62</sup> then you shall say, ‘O יהוה, You have spoken concerning this place to cut it off, so that none shall dwell in it, neither man nor beast, for it is a ruin forever.’
<sup>63</sup> “And it shall be, when you have ended reading this book, that you shall tie a stone to it and throw it into the midst of the Euphrates,
<sup>64</sup> and shall say, ‘So does Baḇel sink and not rise from the evil that I am bringing upon her, and they shall weary themselves.’ ” Thus far are the words of Yirmeyahu.
