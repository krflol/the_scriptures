<sup>1</sup> And the heads of the fathers of the Lĕwites came near to El‛azar the priest, to Yehoshua son of Nun, and to the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Yisra’ĕl.
<sup>2</sup> And they spoke to them at Shiloh in the land of Kena‛an, saying, “ יהוה commanded through Mosheh to give us cities to dwell in, with their open land for our livestock.”
<sup>3</sup> So the children of Yisra’ĕl gave to the Lĕwites from their inheritance, at the command of יהוה, these cities and their open land:
<sup>4</sup> And the lot came out for the clans of the Qehathites. And the children of Aharon the priest, who were of the Lĕwites, had thirteen cities by lot from the tribe of Yehuḏah, from the tribe of Shim‛on, and from the tribe of Binyamin.
<sup>5</sup> And the rest of the children of Qehath had ten cities by lot from the clans of the tribe of Ephrayim, from the tribe of Dan, and from the half-tribe of Menashsheh.
<sup>6</sup> And the children of Gĕrshon had thirteen cities by lot from the clans of the tribe of Yissasḵar, from the tribe of Ashĕr, from the tribe of Naphtali, and from the half-tribe of Menashsheh in Bashan.
<sup>7</sup> The children of Merari for their clans had twelve cities from the tribe of Re’uḇĕn, and from the tribe of Gaḏ, and from the tribe of Zeḇulun.
<sup>8</sup> Thus the children of Yisra’ĕl gave these cities with their open land by lot to the Lĕwites, as יהוה had commanded by the hand of Mosheh.
<sup>9</sup> So from the tribe of the children of Yehuḏah and from the tribe of the children of Shim‛on they gave these cities which are mentioned by name,
<sup>10</sup> and they were for the children of Aharon, one of the clans of the Qehathites, who were of the children of Lĕwi, for the lot was theirs first.
<sup>11</sup> And they gave them Qiryath Arba, that is Ḥeḇron – Arba was the father of Anaq – in the mountains of Yehuḏah, with the open land surrounding it.
<sup>12</sup> And the fields of the city and its villages they gave to Kalĕḇ son of Yephunneh as his possession.
<sup>13</sup> But to the children of Aharon the priest they gave Ḥeḇron with its open land – a city of refuge for the slayer – and Liḇnah with its open land,
<sup>14</sup> and Yattir with its open land, and Eshtemoa with its open land,
<sup>15</sup> and Ḥolon with its open land, and Deḇir with its open land,
<sup>16</sup> and Ayin with its open land, and Yuttah with its open land, and Bĕyth Shemesh with its open land – nine cities from those two tribes.
<sup>17</sup> And from the tribe of Binyamin, Giḇ‛on with its open land, Geḇa with its open land,
<sup>18</sup> Anathoth with its open land, and Almon with its open land – four cities.
<sup>19</sup> All the cities of the children of Aharon, the priests, were thirteen cities with their open lands.
<sup>20</sup> And the clans of the children of Qehath, the Lĕwites, the rest of the children of Qehath, even they had the cities of their lot from the tribe of Ephrayim.
<sup>21</sup> And they gave them Sheḵem with its open land in the mountains of Ephrayim as a city of refuge for the slayer, and Gezer with its open land,
<sup>22</sup> and Qiḇtsayim with its open land, and Bĕyth Ḥoron with its open land – four cities.
<sup>23</sup> And from the tribe of Dan, Elteqĕh with its open land, Gibbethon with its open land,
<sup>24</sup> Ayalon with its open land, and Gath Rimmon with its open land – four cities.
<sup>25</sup> And from the half-tribe of Menashsheh, Ta‛naḵ with its open land, and Gath Rimmon with its open land – two cities.
<sup>26</sup> All the ten cities with their open lands were for the rest of the clans of the children of Qehath.
<sup>27</sup> And to the children of Gĕrshon, of the clans of the Lĕwites, from the other half-tribe of Menashsheh, they gave Golan in Bashan with its open land as a city of refuge for the slayer, and Be‛eshterah with its open land – two cities.
<sup>28</sup> And from the tribe of Yissasḵar, Qishyon with its open land, Daḇerath with its open land,
<sup>29</sup> Yarmuth with its open land, and Ĕn Gannim with its open land – four cities.
<sup>30</sup> And from the tribe of Ashĕr, Mish’al with its open land, Aḇdon with its open land,
<sup>31</sup> Ḥelqath with its open land, and Reḥoḇ with its open land – four cities.
<sup>32</sup> And from the tribe of Naphtali, Qeḏesh in Galil with its open land as a city of refuge for the slayer, and Ḥammoth Dor with its open land, and Qartan with its open land – three cities.
<sup>33</sup> All the cities of the Gĕrshonites for their clans were thirteen cities with their open land.
<sup>34</sup> And to the clans of the children of Merari, the rest of the Lĕwites, from the tribe of Zeḇulun, Yoqne‛am with its open land, Qartah with its open land,
<sup>35</sup> Dimnah with its open land, Nahalal with its open land – four cities.
<sup>36</sup> And from the tribe of Re’uḇĕn, Betser with its open land, Yahtsah with its open land,
<sup>37</sup> Qeḏĕmoth with its open land, and Mĕpha‛ath with its open land – four cities.
<sup>38</sup> And from the tribe of Gaḏ, Ramoth in Gil‛aḏ with its open land as a city of refuge for the slayer, and Maḥanayim with its open land,
<sup>39</sup> Ḥeshbon with its open land, Ya‛zĕr with its open land – four cities in all.
<sup>40</sup> All the cities for the children of Merari for their clans, the rest of the clans of the Lĕwites, were by their lot twelve cities.
<sup>41</sup> All the cities of the Lĕwites within the possession of the children of Yisra’ĕl were forty-eight cities with their open lands.
<sup>42</sup> Each of these cities had its open land surrounding it. So it was with all these cities.
<sup>43</sup> Thus יהוה gave to Yisra’ĕl all the land of which He had sworn to give to their fathers, and they took possession of it, and dwelt in it.
<sup>44</sup> And יהוה gave them rest all around, according to all that He had sworn to their fathers. And not a man of all their enemies stood against them, יהוה gave all their enemies into their hand.
<sup>45</sup> Not a word failed of any good word which יהוה had spoken to the house of Yisra’ĕl – all came in.
