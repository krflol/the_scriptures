<sup>1</sup> And it came to be, after the death of Mosheh the servant of יהוה, that יהוה spoke to Yehoshua son of Nun, the assistant of Mosheh, saying,
<sup>2</sup> “Mosheh My servant is dead, so now, arise, pass over this Yardĕn, you and all this people, to the land which I am giving to them, to the children of Yisra’ĕl.
<sup>3</sup> “Every place on which the sole of your foot treads I have given you, as I spoke to Mosheh.
<sup>4</sup> “From the wilderness and this Leḇanon even as far as the great river, the River Euphrates, all the land of the Ḥittites, and to the Great Sea toward the going down of the sun, is your border.
<sup>5</sup> “No man is going to stand before you all the days of your life. As I was with Mosheh, so I am with you. I do not fail you nor forsake you.
<sup>6</sup> “Be strong and courageous, for you are to let this people inherit the land which I swore to their fathers to give them.
<sup>7</sup> “Only be strong and very courageous, to guard to do according to all the Torah which Mosheh My servant commanded you. Do not turn from it right or left, so that you act wisely wherever you go.
<sup>8</sup> “Do not let this Book of the Torah depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, so that you guard to do according to all that is written in it. For then you shall make your way prosperous, and act wisely.
<sup>9</sup> “Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid, nor be discouraged, for יהוה your Elohim is with you wherever you go.”
<sup>10</sup> And Yehoshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,
<sup>11</sup> “Pass through the midst of the camp and command the people, saying, ‘Prepare food for yourselves, for within three days you are passing over this Yardĕn, to go in to possess the land which יהוה your Elohim is giving you to possess.’ ”
<sup>12</sup> And Yehoshua spoke to the Re’uḇĕnites and to the Gaḏites and to half the tribe of Menashsheh, saying,
<sup>13</sup> “Remember the word which Mosheh, servant of יהוה, commanded you, saying, ‘ יהוה your Elohim is giving you rest, and He shall give you this land.’
<sup>14</sup> “Let your wives, your little ones, and your livestock stay in the land which Mosheh gave you beyond the Yardĕn. But you shall pass before your brothers in fives, all your brave fighters, and shall help them,
<sup>15</sup> until יהוה has given your brothers rest, as unto you. So shall they also take possession of the land which יהוה your Elohim is giving them. Then you shall return to the land of your possession, and shall possess that which Mosheh the servant of יהוה gave you beyond the Yardĕn toward the rising of the sun.”
<sup>16</sup> And they answered Yehoshua, saying, “All that you have commanded us we do, and wherever you send us we go.
<sup>17</sup> “According to all that we obeyed Mosheh, so we obey you. Only, let יהוה your Elohim be with you, as He was with Mosheh.
<sup>18</sup> “Whoever rebels against your command and does not obey your words, in all that you command him, is put to death. Only be strong and courageous.”
