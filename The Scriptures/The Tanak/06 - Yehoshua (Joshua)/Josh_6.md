<sup>1</sup> And Yeriḥo was shut up tight because of the presence of the sons of Yisra’ĕl – none going out, and none coming in.
<sup>2</sup> And יהוה said to Yehoshua, “See! I have given Yeriḥo and its sovereign, mighty brave men, into your hand.
<sup>3</sup> “And you shall go around the city, all the men of battle going around the city once. Do this for six days.
<sup>4</sup> “And let seven priests bear seven rams’ horns before the ark, and on the seventh day go around the city seven times while the priests blow the horns.
<sup>5</sup> “And it shall be, when they make a long blast with the ram’s horn, and when you hear the sound of the horn, that all the people shout with a great shout. And the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall go up every man straight before him.”
<sup>6</sup> And Yehoshua son of Nun called the priests and said to them, “Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven rams’ horns before the ark of יהוה.”
<sup>7</sup> And he said to the people, “Pass over, and go around the city, and let him who is armed pass over before the ark of יהוה.”
<sup>8</sup> And it came to be, when Yehoshua had spoken to the people, that the seven priests bearing the seven rams’ horns before יהוה passed over and blew the horns, and the ark of the covenant of יהוה went after them.
<sup>9</sup> And the armed men went before the priests who blew the horns, and the rear guard came after the ark, going on and blowing the horns.
<sup>10</sup> But Yehoshua had commanded the people, saying, “Do not shout or cause your voice to be heard, nor let any word come out of your mouth, until the day I say to you, ‘Shout!’ Then you shall shout.”
<sup>11</sup> And the ark of יהוה went around the city, going around once. And they came into the camp and stayed in the camp.
<sup>12</sup> And Yehoshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of יהוה.
<sup>13</sup> And seven priests bearing seven rams’ horns before the ark of יהוה were walking, going on, and they blew the horns, and the armed men went before them. But the rear guard came after the ark of יהוה, going on, and blowing the horns.
<sup>14</sup> And the second day they went around the city once and returned to the camp. Thus they did six days.
<sup>15</sup> And it came to be on the seventh day that they rose early, about the dawning of the day, and went around the city seven times in this way. Only on that day they went around the city seven times.
<sup>16</sup> And it came to be at the seventh time, when the priests blew the horns, that Yehoshua said to the people, “Shout, for יהוה has given you the city!
<sup>17</sup> “And the city shall be put under the ban, it and all that is in it belongs to יהוה. Only Raḥaḇ the whore is to live, she and all who are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.
<sup>18</sup> “And you, by all means guard yourselves from that which is under the ban, lest you come under the ban when you take of that which is under the ban, and make the camp of Yisra’ĕl a curse, and shall trouble it.
<sup>19</sup> “But all the silver and gold, and vessels of bronze and iron, are set-apart to יהוה, they go into the treasury of יהוה.”
<sup>20</sup> And the people shouted when the priests blew the horns. And it came to be when the people heard the sound of the horn, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat. And the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they captured the city.
<sup>21</sup> And they put under the ban all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox and sheep and donkey, with the edge of the sword.
<sup>22</sup> And to the two men who had spied out the land Yehoshua said, “Go into the house of the woman, the whore, and from there bring out the woman and all that she has, as you swore to her.”
<sup>23</sup> And the young men, the spies, went in and brought out Raḥaḇ, and her father, and her mother, and her brothers, and all that she had. So they brought out all her relatives and set them outside the camp of Yisra’ĕl.
<sup>24</sup> And they burned the city and all that was in it with fire. Only the silver and gold, and the vessels of bronze and of iron, they put into the treasury of the House of יהוה.
<sup>25</sup> However, Yehoshua kept alive Raḥaḇ the whore, and her father’s household, and all that she had. And she dwelt in the midst of Yisra’ĕl to this day, because she hid the messengers whom Yehoshua sent to spy out Yeriḥo.
<sup>26</sup> And Yehoshua warned them at that time, saying, “Cursed is the man before יהוה who rises up and builds this city Yeriḥo – he lays its foundation with his first-born, and with his youngest he sets up its gates.”
<sup>27</sup> And יהוה was with Yehoshua, and a report about him was in all the land.
