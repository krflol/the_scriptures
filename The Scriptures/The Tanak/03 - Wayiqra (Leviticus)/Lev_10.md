<sup>1</sup> And Naḏaḇ and Aḇihu, the sons of Aharon, each took his fire holder and put fire in it, and put incense on it, and brought strange fire before יהוה, which He had not commanded them.
<sup>2</sup> And fire came out from יהוה and consumed them, and they died before יהוה.
<sup>3</sup> Then Mosheh said to Aharon, “This is what יהוה spoke, saying, ‘By those who come near Me let Me be set-apart! And before all the people let Me be esteemed!’ ” And Aharon was silent.
<sup>4</sup> And Mosheh called to Misha’ĕl and to Eltsaphan, the sons of Uzzi’ĕl the uncle of Aharon, and said to them, “Come near, take your brothers from before the set-apart place out of the camp.”
<sup>5</sup> So they came near and took them by their long shirts out of the camp, as Mosheh had said.
<sup>6</sup> And Mosheh said to Aharon, and to El‛azar and to Ithamar, his sons, “Do not unbind your heads nor tear your garments, lest you die, and wrath come upon all the people. But let your brothers, all the house of Yisra’ĕl, bewail the burning which יהוה has kindled.
<sup>7</sup> “And do not go out from the door of the Tent of Meeting, lest you die, for the anointing oil of יהוה is upon you.” And they did according to the word of Mosheh.
<sup>8</sup> And יהוה spoke to Aharon, saying,
<sup>9</sup> “Do not drink wine or strong drink, you, nor your sons with you, when you go into the Tent of Meeting, lest you die – a law forever throughout your generations,
<sup>10</sup> so as to make a distinction between the set-apart and the profane, and between the unclean and the clean,
<sup>11</sup> and to teach the children of Yisra’ĕl all the laws which יהוה has spoken to them by the hand of Mosheh.”
<sup>12</sup> And Mosheh spoke to Aharon, and to El‛azar and Ithamar, his sons who were left, “Take the grain offering that is left over from the offerings made by fire to יהוה, and eat it without leaven beside the altar, for it is most set-apart.
<sup>13</sup> “And you shall eat it in a set-apart place, because it is yours by law and your sons’ by law, of the offerings made by fire to יהוה, for so I have been commanded.
<sup>14</sup> “And the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the contribution you eat in a clean place, you, and your sons, and your daughters with you. For they are yours by law and your sons’ by law, which are given from the slaughterings of peace offerings of the children of Yisra’ĕl.
<sup>15</sup> “The thigh of the contribution and the breast of the wave offering they bring with the offerings of fat made by fire, to bring as a wave offering before יהוה. And it shall be yours and your sons’ with you, by a law forever, as יהוה has commanded.”
<sup>16</sup> And Mosheh diligently looked for the goat of the sin offering and saw it was burned up. And he was wroth with El‛azar and Ithamar, the sons of Aharon who were left, saying,
<sup>17</sup> “Why have you not eaten the sin offering in a set-apart place, since it is most set-apart, and Elohim has given it to you to bear the crookedness of the congregation, to make atonement for them before יהוה ?
<sup>18</sup> “See, its blood was not brought inside the set-apart place. You should have eaten it without fail in a set-apart place, as I have commanded.”
<sup>19</sup> And Aharon said to Mosheh, “See, today they have brought their sin offering and their burnt offering before יהוה, and matters like these have come to me! If I had eaten the sin offering today, would it have been right in the eyes of יהוה ?”
<sup>20</sup> And when Mosheh heard that, it was good in his eyes.
