<sup>1</sup> And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
<sup>2</sup> “Command the children of Yisra’ĕl that they bring to you clear oil of pressed olives for the light, to make the lamps burn continually.
<sup>3</sup> “Outside the veil of the Witness, in the Tent of Meeting, Aharon is to arrange it from evening until morning before יהוה continually – a law forever throughout your generations.
<sup>4</sup> “He is to arrange the lamps on the clean gold lampstand before יהוה continually.
<sup>5</sup> “And you shall take fine flour and bake twelve cakes with it, two-tenths of an ĕphah in each cake.
<sup>6</sup> “And you shall set them in two rows, six in a row, on the clean table before יהוה.
<sup>7</sup> “And you shall put clear frankincense on each row, and it shall be on the bread as a remembrance portion, an offering made by fire to יהוה.
<sup>8</sup> “On every Sabbath he is to arrange it before יהוה continually, from the children of Yisra’ĕl – an everlasting covenant.
<sup>9</sup> “And it shall be for Aharon and his sons, and they shall eat it in the set-apart place, because it is most set-apart to him from the offerings of יהוה made by fire – an everlasting law.”
<sup>10</sup> And the son of an Yisra’ĕlite woman, whose father was a Mitsrite, went out among the children of Yisra’ĕl. And the Yisra’ĕlite woman’s son and a man of Yisra’ĕl strove in the camp.
<sup>11</sup> And the Yisra’ĕlite woman’s son blasphemed the Name, and cursed. So they brought him to Mosheh. Now his mother’s name was Shelomith the daughter of Diḇri, of the tribe of Dan.
<sup>12</sup> And they put him in under guard, that it might be declared to them at the mouth of יהוה.
<sup>13</sup> And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
<sup>14</sup> “Bring the one who has cursed outside the camp, and all those who heard him shall lay their hands on his head, and all the congregation shall stone him.
<sup>15</sup> “And speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl, saying, ‘Anyone who curses his Elohim shall bear his sin.
<sup>16</sup> ‘And he who blasphemes the Name of יהוה shall certainly be put to death, and all the congregation certainly stone him, the stranger as well as the native. When he blasphemes the Name, he is put to death.
<sup>17</sup> ‘And he who smites the life from any man shall certainly be put to death.
<sup>18</sup> ‘And he who smites a beast repays it, body for body.
<sup>19</sup> ‘And when a man inflicts a blemish upon his neighbour, as he has done so it is done to him:
<sup>20</sup> ‘Fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; as he inflicts a blemish upon him, so it is done to him.
<sup>21</sup> ‘And he who smites a beast repays it, and he who smites a man to death is put to death.
<sup>22</sup> ‘You are to have one right-ruling, for the stranger and for the native, for I am יהוה your Elohim.’ ”
<sup>23</sup> And Mosheh spoke to the children of Yisra’ĕl, and they brought the one who cursed outside the camp, and stoned him with stones. And the children of Yisra’ĕl did as יהוה commanded Mosheh.
