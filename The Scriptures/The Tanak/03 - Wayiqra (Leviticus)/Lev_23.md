<sup>1</sup> And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
<sup>2</sup> “Speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl, and say to them, ‘The appointed times of יהוה, which you are to proclaim as set-apart gatherings, My appointed times, are these:
<sup>3</sup> ‘Six days work is done, but the seventh day is a Sabbath of rest, a set-apart gathering. You do no work, it is a Sabbath to יהוה in all your dwellings.
<sup>4</sup> ‘These are the appointed times of יהוה, set-apart gatherings which you are to proclaim at their appointed times.
<sup>5</sup> ‘In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, between the evenings, is the Passover to יהוה.
<sup>6</sup> ‘And on the fifteenth day of this month is the Festival of Unleavened Bread to יהוה – seven days you eat unleavened bread.
<sup>7</sup> ‘On the first day you have a set-apart gathering, you do no servile work.
<sup>8</sup> ‘And you shall bring an offering made by fire to יהוה for seven days. On the seventh day is a set-apart gathering, you do no servile work.’ ”
<sup>9</sup> And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
<sup>10</sup> “Speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl, and you shall say to them, ‘When you come into the land which I give you, and shall reap its harvest, then you shall bring a sheaf of the first-fruits of your harvest to the priest.
<sup>11</sup> ‘And he shall wave the sheaf before יהוה, for your acceptance. On the morrow after the Sabbath the priest waves it.
<sup>12</sup> ‘And on that day when you wave the sheaf, you shall prepare a male lamb a year old, a perfect one, as a burnt offering to יהוה,
<sup>13</sup> and its grain offering: two-tenths of an ĕphah of fine flour mixed with oil, an offering made by fire to יהוה, a sweet fragrance, and its drink offering: one-fourth of a hin of wine.
<sup>14</sup> ‘And you do not eat bread or roasted grain or fresh grain until the same day that you have brought an offering to your Elohim – a law forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
<sup>15</sup> ‘And from the morrow after the Sabbath, from the day that you brought the sheaf of the wave offering, you shall count for yourselves: seven completed Sabbaths.
<sup>16</sup> ‘Until the morrow after the seventh Sabbath you count fifty days, then you shall bring a new grain offering to יהוה.
<sup>17</sup> ‘Bring from your dwellings for a wave offering two loaves of bread, of two-tenths of an ĕphah of fine flour they are, baked with leaven, first-fruits to יהוה.
<sup>18</sup> ‘And besides the bread, you shall bring seven lambs a year old, perfect ones, and one young bull and two rams. They are a burnt offering to יהוה, with their grain offering and their drink offerings, an offering made by fire for a sweet fragrance to יהוה.
<sup>19</sup> ‘And you shall offer one male goat as a sin offering, and two male lambs a year old, as a peace offering.
<sup>20</sup> ‘And the priest shall wave them, besides the bread of the first-fruits, as a wave offering before יהוה, besides the two lambs. They are set-apart to יהוה for the priest.
<sup>21</sup> ‘And on this same day you shall proclaim a set-apart gathering for yourselves, you do no servile work on it – a law forever in all your dwellings throughout your generations.
<sup>22</sup> ‘And when you reap the harvest of your land do not completely reap the corners of your field when you reap, and do not gather any gleaning from your harvest. Leave them for the poor and for the stranger. I am יהוה your Elohim.’ ”
<sup>23</sup> And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
<sup>24</sup> “Speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl, saying, ‘In the seventh month, on the first day of the month, you have a rest, a remembrance of blowing of trumpets, a set-apart gathering.
<sup>25</sup> ‘You do no servile work, and you shall bring an offering made by fire to יהוה.’ ”
<sup>26</sup> And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
<sup>27</sup> “On the tenth day of this seventh month is the Day of Atonement. It shall be a set-apart gathering for you. And you shall afflict your beings, and shall bring an offering made by fire to יהוה.
<sup>28</sup> “And you do no work on that same day, for it is the Day of Atonement, to make atonement for you before יהוה your Elohim.
<sup>29</sup> “For any being who is not afflicted on that same day, he shall be cut off from his people.
<sup>30</sup> “And any being who does any work on that same day, that being I shall destroy from the midst of his people.
<sup>31</sup> “You do no work – a law forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
<sup>32</sup> ‘It is a Sabbath of rest to you, and you shall afflict your beings. On the ninth day of the month at evening, from evening to evening, you observe your Sabbath.”
<sup>33</sup> And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
<sup>34</sup> “Speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl, saying, ‘On the fifteenth day of this seventh month is the Festival of Booths for seven days to יהוה.
<sup>35</sup> ‘On the first day is a set-apart gathering, you do no servile work.
<sup>36</sup> ‘For seven days you bring an offering made by fire to יהוה. On the eighth day there shall be a set-apart gathering for you, and you shall bring an offering made by fire to יהוה. It is a closing festival, you do no servile work.
<sup>37</sup> ‘These are the appointed times of יהוה which you proclaim as set-apart gatherings, to bring an offering made by fire to יהוה, a burnt offering and a grain offering, a slaughtering and drink offerings, as commanded for every day –
<sup>38</sup> besides the Sabbaths of יהוה, and besides your gifts, and besides all your vows, and besides all your voluntary offerings which you give to יהוה.
<sup>39</sup> ‘On the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you gather in the fruit of the land, observe the festival of יהוה for seven days. On the first day is a rest, and on the eighth day a rest.
<sup>40</sup> ‘And you shall take for yourselves on the first day the fruit of good trees, branches of palm trees, twigs of leafy trees, and willows of the stream, and shall rejoice before יהוה your Elohim for seven days.
<sup>41</sup> ‘And you shall observe it as a festival to יהוה for seven days in the year – a law forever in your generations. Observe it in the seventh month.
<sup>42</sup> ‘Dwell in booths for seven days; all who are native Yisra’ĕlites dwell in booths,
<sup>43</sup> so that your generations know that I made the children of Yisra’ĕl dwell in booths when I brought them out of the land of Mitsrayim. I am יהוה your Elohim.’ ”
<sup>44</sup> Thus did Mosheh speak of the appointed times of יהוה to the children of Yisra’ĕl.
