<sup>1</sup> How fair are your feet in sandals, O daughter of a noble! The curves of your thighs are like ornaments, The work of a craftsman’s hands.
<sup>2</sup> Your navel is a rounded bowl Let it not lack mixed wine. Your body is a heap of wheat, Hedged about with lilies.
<sup>3</sup> Your two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle.
<sup>4</sup> Your neck is like an ivory tower, Your eyes pools in Ḥeshbon By the gate of Bath Rabbim. Your nose is like the tower of Leḇanon looking to Damascus.
<sup>5</sup> Your head upon you is like Mount Karmel, And the hair of your head like purple; The sovereign is held captive by the ringlets.
<sup>6</sup> How fair and how pleasant you are, O love, in delights!
<sup>7</sup> This stature of yours compares to a palm tree, And your breasts to clusters.
<sup>8</sup> I said, “Let me go up to the palm tree, Let me take hold of its tips.” And please, let your breasts be like clusters of the vine, And the fragrance of your breath like apples,
<sup>9</sup> And your palate like the best wine, Going down smoothly for my beloved, Flowing gently, slumbering lips.
<sup>10</sup> I am my beloved’s, and his desire is toward me.
<sup>11</sup> Come, my beloved, let us go forth to the field; Let us stay in the villages.
<sup>12</sup> Let us get up early to the vineyards; Let us see whether the vine has budded, The grape blossoms have opened, The pomegranates have bloomed. There I give you my loves.
<sup>13</sup> The love-apples have given fragrance, And at our gates are all pleasant fruit, New and old, which I have laid up for you, my beloved.
