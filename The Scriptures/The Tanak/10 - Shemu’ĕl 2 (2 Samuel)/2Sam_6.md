<sup>1</sup> Now Dawiḏ again gathered all the chosen men of Yisra’ĕl, thirty thousand.
<sup>2</sup> And Dawiḏ rose up and went with all the people who were with him from Ba‛alĕ Yehuḏah, to bring up from there the ark of Elohim, that is called by the Name, the Name יהוה of Hosts, who dwells between the keruḇim.
<sup>3</sup> And they placed the ark of Elohim on a new wagon, and brought it from the house of Aḇinaḏaḇ, which was on the hill. And Uzzah and Aḥyo, sons of Aḇinaḏaḇ, were leading the new wagon.
<sup>4</sup> And they brought it from the house of Aḇinaḏaḇ, which was on the hill, with the ark of Elohim. And Aḥyo was walking before the ark.
<sup>5</sup> And Dawiḏ and all the house of Yisra’ĕl were dancing before יהוה, with all instruments of fir wood, and with lyres, and with harps, and with tambourines, and with sistrums, and with cymbals.
<sup>6</sup> And when they came to the threshing-floor of Naḵon, Uzzah reached out toward the ark of Elohim and took hold of it, for the oxen stumbled.
<sup>7</sup> And the wrath of יהוה burned against Uzzah, and Elohim smote him there for the fault. And he died there by the ark of Elohim.
<sup>8</sup> And Dawiḏ was displeased because יהוה had broken out against Uzzah. And he called the name of the place Perets Uzzah, until this day.
<sup>9</sup> And Dawiḏ was afraid of יהוה on that day, and said, “How shall the ark of יהוה come to me?”
<sup>10</sup> And Dawiḏ would not move the ark of יהוה with him into the City of Dawiḏ, but Dawiḏ turned it aside to the house of Oḇĕḏ-Eḏom the Gittite.
<sup>11</sup> And the ark of יהוה remained in the house of Oḇĕḏ-Eḏom the Gittite three months, and יהוה blessed Oḇĕḏ-Eḏom and all his house.
<sup>12</sup> And it was reported to Sovereign Dawiḏ, saying, “ יהוה has blessed the house of Oḇĕḏ-Eḏom and all that he has, because of the ark of Elohim.” Dawiḏ then went and brought up the ark of Elohim from the house of Oḇĕḏ-Eḏom to the City of Dawiḏ with rejoicing.
<sup>13</sup> And it came to be, when those bearing the ark of יהוה had gone six steps, that he slaughtered bulls and fatted sheep.
<sup>14</sup> And Dawiḏ danced before יהוה with all his might. And Dawiḏ was wearing a linen shoulder garment.
<sup>15</sup> Thus Dawiḏ and all the house of Yisra’ĕl brought up the ark of יהוה with shouting and with the sound of the ram’s horn.
<sup>16</sup> And it came to be, when the ark of יהוה came into the City of Dawiḏ, that Miḵal, daughter of Sha’ul, looked through a window and saw Sovereign Dawiḏ leaping and dancing before יהוה, and she despised him in her heart.
<sup>17</sup> So they brought the ark of יהוה in, and set it in its place in the midst of the Tent that Dawiḏ had pitched for it. And Dawiḏ brought burnt offerings before יהוה, and peace offerings.
<sup>18</sup> And when Dawiḏ had finished bringing burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the Name of יהוה of hosts.
<sup>19</sup> And he apportioned to all the people, to all the crowd of Yisra’ĕl, from man even to women, to each one a loaf of bread, and a measure, and a cake of raisins. And all the people left, each one to his house.
<sup>20</sup> And Dawiḏ returned to bless his household, and Miḵal the daughter of Sha’ul came out to meet Dawiḏ, and said, “How esteemed was the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl today, uncovering himself today in the eyes of the female servants of his servants, as one of the foolish ones shamelessly uncovers himself!”
<sup>21</sup> So Dawiḏ said to Miḵal, “Before יהוה, who chose me instead of your father and all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of יהוה, over Yisra’ĕl, so I danced before יהוה.
<sup>22</sup> “And I shall be even more slight than this, and shall be humble in my own eyes. But as for the female servants of whom you have spoken, by them I am esteemed.”
<sup>23</sup> And Miḵal the daughter of Sha’ul had no children to the day of her death.
