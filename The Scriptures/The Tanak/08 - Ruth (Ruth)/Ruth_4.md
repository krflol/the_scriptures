<sup>1</sup> And Bo‛az went up to the gate and sat down there. And see, the redeemer of whom Bo‛az had spoken came by. And Bo‛az said, “Turn aside, So-and-so, sit down here.” And he turned aside and sat down.
<sup>2</sup> And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, “Sit down here.” So they sat down.
<sup>3</sup> He then said to the redeemer, “Na‛omi, who has come back from the fields of Mo’aḇ, sold the piece of land which belonged to our brother Elimeleḵ.
<sup>4</sup> “And I thought that I should disclose it to you, saying, ‘Buy it back in the presence of the inhabitants and the elders of my people. If you do redeem it, redeem it. But if you do not redeem it, inform me, so that I know. For there is no one but you to redeem it, and I am next after you.’ ” And he said, “I redeem it.”
<sup>5</sup> And Bo‛az said, “On the day you buy the field from the hand of Na‛omi, you shall also acquire Ruth the Mo’aḇitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance.”
<sup>6</sup> And the redeemer said, “I am not able to redeem it for myself, lest I ruin my own inheritance. Redeem my right of redemption for yourself, for I am not able to redeem it.”
<sup>7</sup> And this was formerly done in Yisra’ĕl concerning redeeming and exchanging, to confirm every word: one man took off his sandal and gave it to the other, and this was a witness in Yisra’ĕl.
<sup>8</sup> So the redeemer said to Bo‛az, “Buy it for yourself.” Then he took off his sandal.
<sup>9</sup> And Bo‛az said to the elders and to all the people, “You are witnesses this day that I have bought all that was Elimeleḵ’s, and all that was Kilyon’s and Maḥlon’s, from the hand of Na‛omi.
<sup>10</sup> “And also, Ruth the Mo’aḇitess, the wife of Maḥlon, I have acquired as my wife, to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance, so that the name of the dead should not be cut off from among his brothers and from the gate of his place. You are witnesses today.”
<sup>11</sup> And all the people who were at the gate, and the elders, said, “Witnesses! יהוה make the woman who is coming to your house as Raḥĕl and as Lĕ’ah, the two who built the house of Yisra’ĕl. And prove your worth in Ephrathah and proclaim the Name in Bĕyth Leḥem.
<sup>12</sup> “And let your house be like the house of Perets, whom Tamar bore to Yehuḏah, of the seed which יהוה does give you from this young woman.”
<sup>13</sup> And Bo‛az took Ruth and she became his wife. And he went in to her, and יהוה granted her conception, and she bore a son.
<sup>14</sup> And the women said to Na‛omi, “Blessed be יהוה, who has not left you this day without a redeemer. And let his Name be proclaimed in Yisra’ĕl!
<sup>15</sup> “And he shall be to you a restorer of life and a sustainer of your old age. For your daughter-in-law, who loves you, who is better to you than seven sons, has borne him.”
<sup>16</sup> And Na‛omi took the child and laid him on her bosom, and became a nurse to him.
<sup>17</sup> And the women, her neighbours, gave him a name, saying, “There is a son born to Na‛omi.” And they called his name Oḇĕḏ. He was the father of Yishai, the father of Dawiḏ.
<sup>18</sup> And this is the genealogy of Perets: Perets brought forth Ḥetsron.
<sup>19</sup> And Ḥetsron brought forth Ram, and Ram brought forth Amminaḏaḇ.
<sup>20</sup> And Amminaḏaḇ brought forth Naḥshon, and Naḥshon brought forth Salmon.
<sup>21</sup> And Salmon brought forth Bo‛az, and Bo‛az brought forth Oḇĕḏ.
<sup>22</sup> And Oḇĕḏ brought forth Yishai, and Yishai brought forth Dawiḏ.
