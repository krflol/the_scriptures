<sup>1</sup> And Na‛omi her mother-in-law said to her, “My daughter, should I not seek rest for you, so that it is well with you?
<sup>2</sup> “And now, is not Bo‛az, with whose young women you have been, our relative? See, he is winnowing barley tonight at the threshing-floor.
<sup>3</sup> “And, you shall bathe and anoint yourself, and put your garments on and go down to the threshing-floor. Do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking.
<sup>4</sup> “And it shall be, when he lies down, that you shall notice the place where he lies, and shall go in and uncover his feet, and lie down. And let him make known to you what you should do.”
<sup>5</sup> And she said to her, “All that you say to me, I do.”
<sup>6</sup> And she went down to the threshing-floor and did according to all that her mother-in-law instructed her.
<sup>7</sup> And Bo‛az ate and drank, and his heart was glad, and he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain. And she came softly and uncovered his feet, and lay down.
<sup>8</sup> And it came to be at midnight that the man was startled, and turned himself, and saw a woman lying at his feet!
<sup>9</sup> And he said, “Who are you?” And she answered, “I am Ruth, your female servant. Now you shall spread your covering over your female servant – for you are a redeemer.”
<sup>10</sup> And he said, “Blessed are you of יהוה, my daughter! For you have shown more kindness at the end than at the beginning, not to go after young men, whether poor or rich.
<sup>11</sup> “And now, my daughter, do not fear. All that you say I do for you, for all the people of my town know that you are a capable woman.
<sup>12</sup> “And now, it is true that I am your redeemer. However, there is a redeemer nearer than I.
<sup>13</sup> “Stop over tonight, and in the morning it shall be that if he does redeem you, good – let him do it. But if he is not pleased to redeem you, then I shall redeem you, as יהוה lives! Lie down until morning.”
<sup>14</sup> And she lay at his feet until morning, and she arose before one could recognise another. And he said, “Let it not be known that the woman came to the threshing-floor.”
<sup>15</sup> And he said, “Bring the shawl that is on you and hold it.” So she held it and he measured six measures of barley, and laid it on her. And she went into the city.
<sup>16</sup> And when she came to her mother-in-law, she said, “Is that you, my daughter?” And she explained to her all that the man had done for her.
<sup>17</sup> And she said, “He gave me these six measures of barley, for he said to me, ‘Do not go empty-handed to your mother-in-law.’ ”
<sup>18</sup> And she said, “Wait, my daughter, until you know how the matter falls, for the man is not going to rest until he has completed the matter this day.”
