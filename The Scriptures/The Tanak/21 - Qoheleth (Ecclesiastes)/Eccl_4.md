<sup>1</sup> Then I looked again at all the oppression that is done under the sun: And see! The tears of the oppressed, but they have no comforter; and power on the side of their oppressors, but they have no comforter.
<sup>2</sup> Therefore I commended the dead who were already dead, more than the living who are still alive.
<sup>3</sup> And better than both is he who has never existed, who has not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.
<sup>4</sup> And I saw that all the toil and skill of the work bring envy between man and his neighbour. That too is futile and feeding on wind.
<sup>5</sup> The fool folds his hands and consumes his own flesh.
<sup>6</sup> Better is a hand filled with rest than both hands filled with toil and feeding on wind.
<sup>7</sup> Then I looked again at futility under the sun:
<sup>8</sup> There is one, without a second, who has neither son nor brother. And there is no end to all his labours. His eye also is not satisfied with riches. “And for whom am I toiling and depriving myself of good?” That too is futility, and an evil task.
<sup>9</sup> Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labour.
<sup>10</sup> For if they fall, one lifts his companion up. But woe to him who is alone when he falls, for he has no one to help him up.
<sup>11</sup> Also, if two lie down together, they keep warm; but how does one keep warm by himself?
<sup>12</sup> Although one might be overpowered, two withstand him. And a threefold cord is not readily broken.
<sup>13</sup> A poor and wise youth is better than an old and foolish sovereign who no longer knows how to take warning.
<sup>14</sup> For he comes out of prison to be sovereign, although in his reign he was born poor.
<sup>15</sup> I have seen all the living who walk under the sun; they were with the second youth who stands in his place.
<sup>16</sup> There was no end of all the people; all of whom he headed. But the ones who come afterward do not rejoice in him. For that too is futile and feeding on wind.
