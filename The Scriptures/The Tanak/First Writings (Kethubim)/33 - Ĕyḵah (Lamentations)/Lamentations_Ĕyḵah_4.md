<sup>1</sup> How dim the gold has become, The fine gold changed! The stones of the set-apart place Are scattered at the head of every street.

<sup>2</sup> The precious sons of Tsiyon Who were weighed against fine gold, How they have been reckoned as clay pots, The work of the hands of the potter!

<sup>3</sup> Even jackals have presented their breasts, They have nursed their young. The daughter of my people has become as cruel, As ostriches in the wilderness.

<sup>4</sup> The tongue of the infant has clung To the roof of its mouth for thirst; Children asked for bread, No one breaks it for them.

<sup>5</sup> Those who ate delicacies Have been laid waste in the streets; Those who were brought up in scarlet Have embraced dunghills.

<sup>6</sup> And the crookedness of the daughter of my people Is greater than the punishment of the sin of Seḏom, Which was overthrown in a moment, And no hands were wrung over her!

<sup>7</sup> Her Nazirites were brighter than snow And whiter than milk; More ruddy in body than rubies, Their cut like sapphire.

<sup>8</sup> Their appearance has become blacker than soot; They have become unrecognised in the streets; Their skin has shrivelled on their bones, It has become dry, it has become as wood.

<sup>9</sup> Better off were those pierced by the sword Than those pierced by hunger; For these pine away, Pierced through for lack of the fruits of the field.

<sup>10</sup> The hands of the compassionate women Have boiled their own children; They became food for them In the destruction of the daughter of my people.

<sup>11</sup> יהוה has completed His wrath, He has poured out His burning displeasure. And He kindled a fire in Tsiyon, And it consumed her foundations.

<sup>12</sup> The sovereigns of the earth did not believe, Nor any of the inhabitants of the world, That an adversary and enemy Would enter the gates of Yerushalayim.

<sup>13</sup> It was because of the sins of her prophets, The crookednesses of her priests, Who shed in her midst the blood of the righteous.

<sup>14</sup> They staggered, blind, in the streets; They have defiled themselves with blood, So that no one was able to touch their garments.

<sup>15</sup> They shouted at them, “Away! Unclean! Away! Away! Touch not!” When they fled and staggered, They said, among the gentiles, “They shall stay no longer.”

<sup>16</sup> The face of יהוה scattered them. He no longer regards them. They showed no respect for the priests Nor favour to the elders.

<sup>17</sup> While we exist, our eyes are consumed, Watching vainly for our help. In our watch-tower we watched for a nation That could not save.

<sup>18</sup> They have hunted our steps From going in our streets. Our end was near, Our days were completed, For our end had come.

<sup>19</sup> Our pursuers were swifter Than the eagles of the heavens. They came hotly after us on the mountains And lay in wait for us in the wilderness.

<sup>20</sup> The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of יהוה, Was caught in their pits, In whose shadow we had thought To live among the gentiles.

<sup>21</sup> Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Eḏom, You who dwell in the land of Uz! The cup is to pass over to you too, So that you become drunk and make yourself naked.

<sup>22</sup> Your crookedness has been completed, O daughter of Tsiyon. He no longer prolongs your exile. He shall punish your crookedness, O daughter of Eḏom, He shall uncover your sins!
