<sup>1</sup> The song of songs, which is Shelomoh’s.

<sup>2</sup> Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth, For your loves are better than wine.

<sup>3</sup> For fragrance your oils are good. Your name is oil poured forth,

<sup>4</sup> Draw me! We run after you. The sovereign has brought me into his inner rooms. We exult and rejoice in you. We praise your loves more than wine. Rightly do they love you.

<sup>5</sup> I am dark, but lovely, O daughters of Yerushalayim, Like the tents of Qĕḏar, Like the curtains of Shelomoh.

<sup>6</sup> Do not look upon me, because I am dark, Because the sun has tanned me. My mother’s sons were displeased with me. They made me the keeper of the vineyards, My own vineyard I have not kept.

<sup>7</sup> Make known to me, O you whom my being loves, Where you feed your flock, Where you make it rest at noon. For why should I be as one who is veiled Beside the flocks of your companions?

<sup>8</sup> If you do not know, O fairest among women, Go in the footsteps of the flock, And feed your little goats beside the shepherds’ dwellings.

<sup>9</sup> I have compared you, my love, To my filly among Pharaoh’s chariots.

<sup>10</sup> Your cheeks are pretty with ornaments, Your neck with strings of beads.

<sup>11</sup> Let us make you ornaments of gold with studs of silver.

<sup>12</sup> While the sovereign is at his table, My nard shall give its fragrance.

<sup>13</sup> My beloved is a bundle of myrrh to me, Lying between my breasts.

<sup>14</sup> My beloved is to me a cluster of henna blooms In the vineyards of Ĕn Geḏi.

<sup>15</sup> See, you are fair, my love! See, you are fair! Your eyes are as doves.

<sup>16</sup> See, you are handsome, my beloved! Yea, pleasant! Also our bed is green.

<sup>17</sup> The beams of our houses are cedar, our rafters are of fir.
