<sup>1</sup> See, you are fair, my love! See, you are fair! Your eyes are as doves behind your veil. Your hair is like a flock of goats, Going down from Mount Gil‛aḏ.

<sup>2</sup> Your teeth are like a flock of shorn sheep Which have come up from the washing, All of them bear twins, and not one loses her young.

<sup>3</sup> Your lips are like a cord of scarlet, And your speech is lovely. Your cheeks behind your veil are like a piece of pomegranate.

<sup>4</sup> Your neck is like the tower of Dawiḏ, Built for an armoury, On which hang a thousand shields, All the armour of mighty men.

<sup>5</sup> Your two breasts are like two fawns, Twins of a gazelle, pasturing among the lilies.

<sup>6</sup> Until the day breaks and the shadows have fled, I shall go my way to the mountain of myrrh, And to the hill of frankincense.

<sup>7</sup> You are all fair, my love, and not a blemish is on you.

<sup>8</sup> Come with me from Leḇanon, My bride, with me from Leḇanon. Look from the top of Amana, From the top of Shenir and Ḥermon, From the dens of lions, From the mountains of the leopards.

<sup>9</sup> You have put heart into me, My sister, my bride; You have put heart into me With one glance of your eyes, With one bead of your necklace.

<sup>10</sup> How sweet have been your loves, My sister, my bride! How much better than wine are your loves, And the fragrance of your perfumes than all spices!

<sup>11</sup> Your lips, O my bride, drip as the honeycomb; Honey and milk are under your tongue. And the fragrance of your garments Is like the fragrance of Leḇanon.

<sup>12</sup> A garden locked is my sister, my bride, A fountain locked, a spring sealed up.

<sup>13</sup> Your plants are an orchard of pomegranates with pleasant fruits, With henna, nard,

<sup>14</sup> Nard and saffron, Calamus and cinnamon, With all trees of frankincense, Myrrh and aloes, With all the chief spices;

<sup>15</sup> A garden spring, A well of living waters, And streams from Leḇanon.

<sup>16</sup> Awake, O north wind, and come, O south! Blow upon my garden, let its spices flow out. Let my beloved come to his garden And eat its pleasant fruits.
