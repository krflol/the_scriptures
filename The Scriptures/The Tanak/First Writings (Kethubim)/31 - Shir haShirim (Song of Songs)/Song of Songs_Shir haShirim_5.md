<sup>1</sup> I have come to my garden, My sister, my bride; I have plucked my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk. Eat, O friends! Drink, and drink deeply, O beloved ones!

<sup>2</sup> I was sleeping, But my heart was awake – the voice of my beloved! He knocks, “Open for me, my sister, My love, my dove, my perfect one; For my head is drenched with dew, My locks with the drops of the night.”

<sup>3</sup> I have taken off my robe, should I put it on? I have washed my feet, should I dirty them?

<sup>4</sup> My beloved put his hand by the latch, And my feelings were deeply moved for him.

<sup>5</sup> I rose to open for my beloved, And my hands dripped with myrrh, My fingers with flowing myrrh, On the handles of the lock.

<sup>6</sup> I opened for my beloved, But my beloved had turned away, had gone. My being went out when he spoke. I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.

<sup>7</sup> The watchmen who went about the city found me. They struck me, they bruised me; The keepers of the walls lifted my veil from me.

<sup>8</sup> I have put you under oath, O daughters of Yerushalayim, If you find my beloved, That you inform him that I am faint with love!

<sup>9</sup> What kind of a beloved is your beloved, O fairest among women? What kind of a beloved is your beloved, That you have put us under oath?

<sup>10</sup> My beloved is dazzling and ruddy, Chief among ten thousand.

<sup>11</sup> His head is refined gold; His locks are wavy, black as a raven.

<sup>12</sup> His eyes are like doves by streams of waters, Washed with milk, and fitly set.

<sup>13</sup> His cheeks are like a bed of spices, Raised bed of scented plants. His lips are lilies, dripping flowing myrrh.

<sup>14</sup> His hands are rods of gold set with beryl. His body is carved ivory, covered with sapphires.

<sup>15</sup> His legs are columns of marble Founded on sockets of fine gold. His appearance is like Leḇanon, Choice as the cedars.

<sup>16</sup> His mouth is most sweet, And he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Yerushalayim!
