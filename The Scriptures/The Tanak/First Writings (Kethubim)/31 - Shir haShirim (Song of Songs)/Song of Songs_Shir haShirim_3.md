<sup>1</sup> On my bed at night I sought the beloved of my being; I sought him, but I did not find him.

<sup>2</sup> “Come, let me arise, and go about the city, In the streets and in the broad places I seek the beloved of my being.” I sought him, but I did not find him.

<sup>3</sup> The watchmen who go about the city found me, to whom I said, “Have you seen the beloved of my being?”

<sup>4</sup> Scarcely had I passed by them, When I found the beloved of my being. I held him and would not let him go, Until I had brought him to the house of my mother, And into the room of her who conceived me.

<sup>5</sup> I have put you under oath, O daughters of Yerushalayim, By the gazelles or by the does of the field, Do not stir up nor awaken love until it pleases.

<sup>6</sup> Who is this coming out of the wilderness Like columns of smoke, Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, From all the merchant’s fragrant powders?

<sup>7</sup> See, it is Shelomoh’s couch – Sixty mighty men are around it, Of the mighty men of Yisra’ĕl,

<sup>8</sup> All of them holding swords, Skilled in battle, Each one has his sword on his thigh Because of fear in the night.

<sup>9</sup> Sovereign Shelomoh made himself A litter of the wood of Leḇanon;

<sup>10</sup> He made its posts of silver, Its support of gold, its seat of purple, Within it was decked with love By the daughters of Yerushalayim.

<sup>11</sup> Go forth, O daughters of Tsiyon, And see Sovereign Shelomoh with the crown With which his mother crowned him on the day of his wedding, And on the day of his gladness of heart.
