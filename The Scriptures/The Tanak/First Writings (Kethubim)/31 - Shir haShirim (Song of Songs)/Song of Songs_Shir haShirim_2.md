<sup>1</sup> I am the rose of Sharon, The lily of the valleys.

<sup>2</sup> Like a lily among thorns, So is my love among the daughters.

<sup>3</sup> Like an apple tree among the trees of the forest, So is my beloved among the sons. I delighted in his shade and sat down, And his fruit was sweet to my taste.

<sup>4</sup> He brought me to the house of wine, And his banner over me was love.

<sup>5</sup> “Strengthen me with raisin cakes, Refresh me with apples, for I am faint with love.”

<sup>6</sup> His left hand is under my head, And his right hand embraces me.

<sup>7</sup> I have put you under oath, O daughters of Yerushalayim, By the gazelles or by the does of the field, Do not stir up nor awaken love until it pleases.

<sup>8</sup> The voice of my beloved! See, he is coming, Leaping on the mountains, skipping on the hills.

<sup>9</sup> My beloved is like a gazelle or like a young stag. See, he is standing behind our wall, Looking through the windows, Peering through the lattice.

<sup>10</sup> My beloved responded and said to me, “Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.

<sup>11</sup> “For look, the winter is past, the rain is over, gone.

<sup>12</sup> “The flowers have appeared in the earth; The time of singing has come, And the voice of the turtledove has been heard in our land.

<sup>13</sup> “The fig tree has ripened her figs, And the vines with the tender grapes have given a good fragrance. Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away!

<sup>14</sup> “O my dove, in the clefts of the rock, In the covering of the cliff, Let me see your appearance, Let me hear your voice; For your voice is sweet, And your appearance is lovely.”

<sup>15</sup> Catch the foxes for us, The little foxes that spoil the vines, And our vines are all blossom.

<sup>16</sup> My beloved is mine, and I am his. He feeds his flock among the lilies.

<sup>17</sup> Until the day breaks and the shadows have fled, Turn, my beloved, And be like a gazelle or a young stag On the mountains of Bether.
