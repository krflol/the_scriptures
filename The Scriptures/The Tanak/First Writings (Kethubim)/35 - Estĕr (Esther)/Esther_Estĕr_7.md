<sup>1</sup> And the sovereign and Haman came in, to drink with Sovereigness Estĕr.

<sup>2</sup> And again on the second day, at the feast of wine, the sovereign said to Estĕr, “What is your petition, Sovereigness Estĕr? And it is given to you. And what is your request? Up to half my reign, and it is done!”

<sup>3</sup> And Sovereigness Estĕr answered and said, “If I have found favour in your eyes, O sovereign, and if it pleases the sovereign, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request.

<sup>4</sup> “For we have been sold, my people and I, to be cut off, to be slain, and to be destroyed. And if we had been sold as male and female slaves, I would have kept silent, although the adversary could not make up for the sovereign’s loss.”

<sup>5</sup> Then Sovereign Aḥashwĕrosh asked Sovereigness Estĕr, “Who is he, and where is he, whose heart is set to do so?”

<sup>6</sup> And Estĕr said, “The adversary and enemy is this evil Haman!” Then Haman was afraid before the sovereign and sovereigness.

<sup>7</sup> And the sovereign, arising in his wrath from the feast of wine, went into the palace garden. And Haman remained before Sovereigness Estĕr, pleading for his life, for he saw that evil had been decided against him by the sovereign.

<sup>8</sup> And when the sovereign returned from the palace garden to the place of the feast of wine, Haman was falling on the couch where Estĕr was. Then the sovereign said, “Also to ravish the sovereigness while I am in the house?” As the word left the sovereign’s mouth, they covered Haman’s face.

<sup>9</sup> And Ḥarḇonah, one of the eunuchs, said to the sovereign, “Also, see the stake, fifty cubits high, which Haman made for Mordeḵai, who spoke good on behalf of the sovereign, is standing at the house of Haman.” And the sovereign said, “Impale him on it!”

<sup>10</sup> And they impaled Haman on the stake that he had prepared for Mordeḵai, and the sovereign’s wrath abated.

<sup>1</sup> And the sovereign and Haman came in, to drink with Sovereigness Estĕr.

<sup>2</sup> And again on the second day, at the feast of wine, the sovereign said to Estĕr, “What is your petition, Sovereigness Estĕr? And it is given to you. And what is your request? Up to half my reign, and it is done!”
