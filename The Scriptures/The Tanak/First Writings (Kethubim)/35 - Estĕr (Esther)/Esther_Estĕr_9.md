<sup>1</sup> And in the twelfth month, that is, the month of Aḏar, on the thirteenth day, when the sovereign’s command and his decree came to be done, on the day that the enemies of the Yehuḏim had waited to overpower them, it turned around, so that the Yehuḏim overpowered those who hated them.

<sup>2</sup> The Yehuḏim assembled in their cities, throughout all the provinces of Sovereign Aḥashwĕrosh to lay hands on those who sought their evil. And no one stood against them, because fear of them fell upon all people.

<sup>3</sup> And all the officials of the provinces, and the viceroys, and the governors, and all those doing the sovereign’s work, helped the Yehuḏim, because the fear of Mordeḵai fell upon them.

<sup>4</sup> For Mordeḵai was great in the palace of the sovereign, and his report spread into all the provinces, for this man Mordeḵai became greater and greater.

<sup>5</sup> And the Yehuḏim smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, with slaughter and destruction, and did what they pleased to those who hated them.

<sup>6</sup> And in the citadel of Shushan the Yehuḏim slew and destroyed five hundred men.

<sup>7</sup> And they slew Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha,

<sup>8</sup> and Poratha, and Aḏalya, and Ariḏatha,

<sup>9</sup> and Parmashta, and Arisai, and Ariḏai, and Wayezatha,

<sup>10</sup> the ten sons of Haman son of Hammeḏatha, the enemy of the Yehuḏim. But they did not lay a hand on the plunder.

<sup>11</sup> On that day the number of those who were slain in the citadel of Shushan came before the sovereign.

<sup>12</sup> And the sovereign said to Sovereigness Estĕr, “The Yehuḏim have slain and destroyed five hundred men in the citadel of Shushan, and the ten sons of Haman. What have they done in the rest of the sovereign’s provinces? And what is your petition? And it is given to you. And what is your further request? And it is done.”

<sup>13</sup> And Estĕr said, “If it pleases the sovereign, let it be given to the Yehuḏim who are in Shushan to do again tomorrow according to today’s decree, and let Haman’s ten sons be impaled on the stake.”

<sup>14</sup> And the sovereign commanded this to be done. And the decree was given in Shushan, and they impaled Haman’s ten sons.

<sup>15</sup> And the Yehuḏim who were in Shushan also assembled on the fourteenth day of the month of Aḏar and they slew three hundred men at Shushan. But they did not lay a hand on the plunder.

<sup>16</sup> And the rest of the Yehuḏim in the sovereign’s provinces assembled and stood for their lives, and to get rest from their enemies, and to slay seventy-five thousand of their enemies. But they did not lay a hand on the plunder.

<sup>17</sup> That was on the thirteenth day of the month of Aḏar, and on the fourteenth day of the month they rested and made it a day of feasting and gladness.

<sup>18</sup> But the Yehuḏim who were at Shushan assembled on the thirteenth day, as well as on the fourteenth day. And on the fifteenth day of the month they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.

<sup>19</sup> Therefore the Yehuḏim of the villages who dwelt in the unwalled towns were making the fourteenth day of the month of Aḏar a good day of gladness and feasting, and for sending portions to one another.

<sup>20</sup> And Mordeḵai wrote these matters and sent letters to all the Yehuḏim who were in all the provinces of Sovereign Aḥashwĕrosh, both near and far,

<sup>21</sup> to establish among them, to observe the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month of Aḏar, yearly,

<sup>22</sup> as the days on which the Yehuḏim had rest from their enemies, as the month which was turned from sorrow to joy for them, and from mourning to a good day, that they should make them days of feasting and joy, of sending portions to one another and gifts to the poor.

<sup>23</sup> And the Yehuḏim undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordeḵai had written to them,

<sup>24</sup> because Haman, son of Hammeḏatha the Aḡaḡite, the adversary of all the Yehuḏim, had plotted against the Yehuḏim to destroy them, and had cast Pur – that is, the lot – to crush them and to destroy them.

<sup>25</sup> But when she came before the sovereign, he commanded by letter that his evil plot which Haman had plotted against the Yehuḏim should return on his own head, and that he and his sons should be impaled on the stake.

<sup>26</sup> Therefore they called these days Purim, after the name Pur. Therefore, because of all the words of this letter, what they had seen concerning this matter, and what had come upon them,

<sup>27</sup> the Yehuḏim established and imposed it upon themselves and upon their seed and all who should join them, that without fail they should observe these two days every year, according to their writing and at their appointed time,

<sup>28</sup> and that these days should be remembered and observed throughout every generation, every clan, every province, and every city, and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Yehuḏim, and that the remembrance of them should not cease from their seed.

<sup>29</sup> And Sovereigness Estĕr, the daughter of Aḇiḥayil, with Mordeḵai the Yehuḏite, wrote with all authority to confirm this second letter about Purim.

<sup>30</sup> And Mordeḵai sent letters to all the Yehuḏim, to the hundred and twenty-seven provinces of the reign of Aḥashwĕrosh, words of peace and truth,

<sup>31</sup> to establish these days of Purim at their appointed times, as Mordeḵai the Yehuḏite and Sovereigness Estĕr had established for them, and as they had established for themselves and their seed concerning matters of their fastings and lamenting.

<sup>32</sup> And the decree of Estĕr established these matters of Purim, and it was written in the book.

<sup>1</sup> And in the twelfth month, that is, the month of Aḏar, on the thirteenth day, when the sovereign’s command and his decree came to be done, on the day that the enemies of the Yehuḏim had waited to overpower them, it turned around, so that the Yehuḏim overpowered those who hated them.

<sup>2</sup> The Yehuḏim assembled in their cities, throughout all the provinces of Sovereign Aḥashwĕrosh to lay hands on those who sought their evil. And no one stood against them, because fear of them fell upon all people.

<sup>3</sup> And all the officials of the provinces, and the viceroys, and the governors, and all those doing the sovereign’s work, helped the Yehuḏim, because the fear of Mordeḵai fell upon them.

<sup>4</sup> For Mordeḵai was great in the palace of the sovereign, and his report spread into all the provinces, for this man Mordeḵai became greater and greater.

<sup>5</sup> And the Yehuḏim smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, with slaughter and destruction, and did what they pleased to those who hated them.

<sup>6</sup> And in the citadel of Shushan the Yehuḏim slew and destroyed five hundred men.

<sup>7</sup> And they slew Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha,

<sup>8</sup> and Poratha, and Aḏalya, and Ariḏatha,

<sup>9</sup> and Parmashta, and Arisai, and Ariḏai, and Wayezatha,

<sup>10</sup> the ten sons of Haman son of Hammeḏatha, the enemy of the Yehuḏim. But they did not lay a hand on the plunder.

<sup>11</sup> On that day the number of those who were slain in the citadel of Shushan came before the sovereign.

<sup>12</sup> And the sovereign said to Sovereigness Estĕr, “The Yehuḏim have slain and destroyed five hundred men in the citadel of Shushan, and the ten sons of Haman. What have they done in the rest of the sovereign’s provinces? And what is your petition? And it is given to you. And what is your further request? And it is done.”

<sup>13</sup> And Estĕr said, “If it pleases the sovereign, let it be given to the Yehuḏim who are in Shushan to do again tomorrow according to today’s decree, and let Haman’s ten sons be impaled on the stake.”

<sup>14</sup> And the sovereign commanded this to be done. And the decree was given in Shushan, and they impaled Haman’s ten sons.

<sup>15</sup> And the Yehuḏim who were in Shushan also assembled on the fourteenth day of the month of Aḏar and they slew three hundred men at Shushan. But they did not lay a hand on the plunder.

<sup>16</sup> And the rest of the Yehuḏim in the sovereign’s provinces assembled and stood for their lives, and to get rest from their enemies, and to slay seventy-five thousand of their enemies. But they did not lay a hand on the plunder.

<sup>17</sup> That was on the thirteenth day of the month of Aḏar, and on the fourteenth day of the month they rested and made it a day of feasting and gladness.

<sup>18</sup> But the Yehuḏim who were at Shushan assembled on the thirteenth day, as well as on the fourteenth day. And on the fifteenth day of the month they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.

<sup>19</sup> Therefore the Yehuḏim of the villages who dwelt in the unwalled towns were making the fourteenth day of the month of Aḏar a good day of gladness and feasting, and for sending portions to one another.

<sup>20</sup> And Mordeḵai wrote these matters and sent letters to all the Yehuḏim who were in all the provinces of Sovereign Aḥashwĕrosh, both near and far,

<sup>21</sup> to establish among them, to observe the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month of Aḏar, yearly,

<sup>22</sup> as the days on which the Yehuḏim had rest from their enemies, as the month which was turned from sorrow to joy for them, and from mourning to a good day, that they should make them days of feasting and joy, of sending portions to one another and gifts to the poor.

<sup>23</sup> And the Yehuḏim undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordeḵai had written to them,

<sup>24</sup> because Haman, son of Hammeḏatha the Aḡaḡite, the adversary of all the Yehuḏim, had plotted against the Yehuḏim to destroy them, and had cast Pur – that is, the lot – to crush them and to destroy them.

<sup>25</sup> But when she came before the sovereign, he commanded by letter that his evil plot which Haman had plotted against the Yehuḏim should return on his own head, and that he and his sons should be impaled on the stake.

<sup>26</sup> Therefore they called these days Purim, after the name Pur. Therefore, because of all the words of this letter, what they had seen concerning this matter, and what had come upon them,

<sup>29</sup> And Sovereigness Estĕr, the daughter of Aḇiḥayil, with Mordeḵai the Yehuḏite, wrote with all authority to confirm this second letter about Purim.

<sup>30</sup> And Mordeḵai sent letters to all the Yehuḏim, to the hundred and twenty-seven provinces of the reign of Aḥashwĕrosh, words of peace and truth,

<sup>31</sup> to establish these days of Purim at their appointed times, as Mordeḵai the Yehuḏite and Sovereigness Estĕr had established for them, and as they had established for themselves and their seed concerning matters of their fastings and lamenting.

<sup>32</sup> And the decree of Estĕr established these matters of Purim, and it was written in the book.
