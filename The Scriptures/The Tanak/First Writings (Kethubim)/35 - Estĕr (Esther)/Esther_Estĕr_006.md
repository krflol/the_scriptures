<sup>1</sup> On that night the sleep of the sovereign fled, and he commanded to bring the book of the records of the annals. And they were read before the sovereign.

<sup>2</sup> And it was found written that Mordeḵai had told of Biḡthana and Teresh, two of the sovereign’s eunuchs, the doorkeepers who had sought to lay hands on Sovereign Aḥashwĕrosh.

<sup>3</sup> Then the sovereign said, “What has been done in value or in greatness to Mordeḵai for this?” And the sovereign’s servants who attended him said, “Naught has been done for him.”

<sup>4</sup> And the sovereign said, “Who is in the court?” Now Haman had come into the outer court of the sovereign’s palace to speak to the sovereign to impale Mordeḵai on the stake that he had prepared for him.

<sup>5</sup> And the sovereign’s servants said to him, “Look, Haman is standing in the court.” And the sovereign said, “Let him come in.”

<sup>6</sup> And when Haman came in, the sovereign asked him, “What is to be done for the man whom the sovereign delights to value?” Now Haman thought in his heart, “Whom would the sovereign delight to value more than me?”

<sup>7</sup> And Haman answered the sovereign, “For the man whom the sovereign delights to value,

<sup>8</sup> let a royal robe be brought which the sovereign has worn, and a horse on which the sovereign has ridden, one with a royal crest placed on its head.

<sup>9</sup> “And let this robe and horse be given into the hand of one of the sovereign’s most noble princes. Let them dress the man whom the sovereign delights to value. And make him ride on horseback through the city square, and proclaim before him, ‘Thus it is done to the man whom the sovereign delights to value!’ ”

<sup>10</sup> And the sovereign said to Haman, “Hurry, take the robe and the horse, as you have spoken, and do so for Mordeḵai the Yehuḏite who sits in the sovereign’s gate. Let no word fail of all that you have spoken.”

<sup>11</sup> And Haman took the robe and the horse, and robed Mordeḵai and led him on horseback through the city square, and proclaimed before him, “Thus it is done to the man the sovereign delights to value.”

<sup>12</sup> Then Mordeḵai went back to the sovereign’s gate. But Haman hurried to his house, mourning and with covered head.

<sup>13</sup> And when Haman related to his wife Zeresh and all his friends all that had befallen him, his wise men and his wife Zeresh said to him, “If Mordeḵai, before whom you have begun to fall, is from the seed of the Yehuḏim, you are not going to prevail against him but certainly fall before him.”

<sup>14</sup> While they were still speaking with him, the sovereign’s eunuchs came, and hurried to bring Haman to the feast which Estĕr had prepared.
