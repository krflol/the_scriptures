<sup>1</sup> יהוה is my shepherd; I do not lack.

<sup>2</sup> He makes me to lie down in green pastures; He leads me beside still waters.

<sup>3</sup> He turns back my being; He leads me in paths of righteousness For His Name’s sake.

<sup>4</sup> When I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil. For You are with me; Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me.

<sup>5</sup> You spread before me a table in the face of my enemies; You have anointed my head with oil; My cup runs over.

<sup>6</sup> Only goodness and kindness follow me All the days of my life; And I shall dwell in the House of יהוה, To the length of days!
