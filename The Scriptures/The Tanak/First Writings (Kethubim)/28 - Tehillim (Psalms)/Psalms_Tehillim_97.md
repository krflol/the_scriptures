<sup>1</sup> יהוה shall reign. The earth rejoices. Many isles are glad!

<sup>2</sup> Clouds and darkness all around Him, Righteousness and right-ruling are the foundation of His throne.

<sup>3</sup> Fire goes before Him, And burns up His adversaries round about.

<sup>4</sup> His lightnings shall light the world, The earth shall see and tremble.

<sup>5</sup> The mountains shall melt like wax before the face of יהוה, Before the face of the Master of all the earth.

<sup>6</sup> The heavens shall declare His righteousness, And all the peoples shall see His esteem.

<sup>7</sup> All are put to shame who serve carved images, Those boasting of matters of naught. Bow yourselves to Him, all you mighty ones.

<sup>8</sup> Tsiyon shall hear and be glad, And the daughters of Yehuḏah rejoice Because of Your right-rulings, O יהוה.

<sup>9</sup> For You, יהוה, are the Most High over all the earth, You shall be greatly exalted, over all mighty ones.

<sup>10</sup> You who love יהוה, hate evil! He guards the lives of His kind ones, He delivers them out of the hand of the wrong.

<sup>11</sup> Light is sown for the righteous, And gladness for the upright in heart.

<sup>12</sup> Rejoice in יהוה, you righteous, And give thanks at the remembrance of His Set-apartness.
