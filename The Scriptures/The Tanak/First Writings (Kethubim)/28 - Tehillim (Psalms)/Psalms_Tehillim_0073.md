<sup>1</sup> Elohim is truly good to Yisra’ĕl, To those whose heart is clean.

<sup>2</sup> But as for me, my feet had almost stumbled, My steps had nearly slipped.

<sup>3</sup> For I was envious of the boasters, When I saw the peace of the wrong-doers.

<sup>4</sup> For death has no pangs for them, And their strength is firm.

<sup>5</sup> They are not in trouble as other men, And they are not plagued like other men.

<sup>6</sup> So pride is their necklace, The garment of violence covers them.

<sup>7</sup> Their eyes bulge from fatness; Their heart overflows with imaginations.

<sup>8</sup> They mock and speak in the evil of oppression; They speak loftily.

<sup>9</sup> They have set their mouth against the heavens, And their tongue walks through the earth, saying:

<sup>10</sup> “Therefore His people return here, And waters of a filled cup are drained by them!”

<sup>11</sup> And they have said, “How could Ĕl know? And is there knowledge in the Most High?”

<sup>12</sup> See, these are the wrong, And always at ease, They have amassed wealth!

<sup>13</sup> Indeed, in vain have I cleansed my heart, And washed my hands in innocence.

<sup>14</sup> For I am plagued all day long, And my reproof is every morning.

<sup>15</sup> If I had said, “Let me speak thus,” See, I would have deceived A generation of Your children.

<sup>16</sup> Yet, when I tried to understand this, It was labour to my eyes –

<sup>17</sup> Until I went into the set-apart place of Ĕl; Then I perceived their end.

<sup>18</sup> Indeed, You set them in slippery places; You make them fall to ruins.

<sup>19</sup> How suddenly they are ruined! Completely swept away through destructions.

<sup>20</sup> יהוה, when You awake You despise their image, As one does a dream after waking.

<sup>21</sup> For my heart was in a ferment, And I was pierced in my kidneys.

<sup>22</sup> I was stupid and ignorant, I was like a beast toward You.

<sup>23</sup> Yet I am always with You, You took hold of my right hand.

<sup>24</sup> You lead me by Your counsel, And afterward receive me unto esteem.

<sup>25</sup> Whom do I have in the heavens? And I have desired no one besides You on earth.

<sup>26</sup> My flesh and my heart shall waste away, But Elohim is the rock of my heart And my portion forever.

<sup>27</sup> For look, those who are far from You perish; You shall cut off all those Who go whoring away from You.

<sup>28</sup> But as for me, it is good to be near Elohim. I have made my refuge in the Master יהוה, To declare all Your works.
