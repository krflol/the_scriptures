<sup>1</sup> I cry out to יהוה with my voice; I pray to יהוה with my voice.

<sup>2</sup> I pour out my complaint before Him; I declare before Him my distress.

<sup>3</sup> When my spirit grew faint within me, Then You know my path. In the way in which I walk They have hidden a trap for me.

<sup>4</sup> Look to the right hand and see, And no one is concerned for me; No refuge remains to me; No one inquires after my being.

<sup>5</sup> I cried out to You, O יהוה : I said, “You are my refuge, My portion in the land of the living.

<sup>6</sup> “Listen to my cry, For I am brought very low; Deliver me from my persecutors, For they are too strong for me.

<sup>7</sup> “Bring my being out of prison, To give thanks to Your Name. Let the righteous gather around me, Because You deal kindly with me.”
