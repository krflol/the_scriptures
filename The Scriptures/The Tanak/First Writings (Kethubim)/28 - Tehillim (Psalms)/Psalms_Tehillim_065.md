<sup>1</sup> To You, stillness, praise, in Tsiyon, O Elohim; And to You a vow is paid.

<sup>2</sup> To You who hears all prayer, all flesh comes.

<sup>3</sup> Crooked matters were mightier than I; As for our transgressions, You do cover them.

<sup>4</sup> Blessed is the one You choose, And bring near to dwell in Your courts. We are satisfied with the goodness of Your house, Your set-apart Hĕḵal.

<sup>5</sup> By awesome deeds in righteousness You answer us, O Elohim of our deliverance, The Trust of all the ends of the earth, And the distant seas;

<sup>6</sup> Who established the mountains by His strength, Being girded with might;

<sup>7</sup> Who stills the roaring of the seas, The roaring of their waves, And the uproar of the peoples.

<sup>8</sup> And they who dwell in the farthest parts, Are afraid of Your signs; You make the outgoings of the morning and evening rejoice.

<sup>9</sup> You have visited the earth and watered it, You greatly enrich it; The river of Elohim is filled with water; You provide their grain, For so You have prepared it.

<sup>10</sup> Its ridges have been filled, Its furrows have been deepened, You make it soft with showers, You bless its growth.

<sup>11</sup> You have crowned the year with Your goodness, And Your paths drip with fatness.

<sup>12</sup> The pastures of the wilderness drip, And the hills are girded with rejoicing.

<sup>13</sup> The meadows are dressed in flocks, And valleys are covered with grain; They shout for joy and sing.
