<sup>1</sup> Save me, O Elohim! For waters have come up to my neck.

<sup>2</sup> I have sunk in deep mud, And there is no place to stand; I have come into deep waters, And the floods overflow me.

<sup>3</sup> I am worn out from my crying; My throat is dry; My eyes grow dim As I wait for my Elohim.

<sup>4</sup> Those who hate me without a cause Are more than the hairs of my head; They are mighty who would destroy me, My lying enemies; What I did not steal, I restored.

<sup>5</sup> O Elohim, You Yourself know my foolishness; And my guilt has not been hidden from You.

<sup>6</sup> Let not those who wait for You, O Master יהוה of hosts, Be ashamed because of me; Let not those who seek You Be humbled because of me, O Elohim of Yisra’ĕl.

<sup>7</sup> Because I have borne reproach for Your sake; Shame has covered my face.

<sup>8</sup> I have become a stranger to my brothers, And a foreigner to my mother’s children;

<sup>9</sup> Because ardour for Your house has eaten me up, And the reproaches of those who reproach You have fallen on me.

<sup>10</sup> And I wept in my being with fasting, And it became my reproach.

<sup>11</sup> And when I put on sackcloth, I became a proverb to them.

<sup>12</sup> They who sit in the gate talk about me, And I am the song of the drunkards.

<sup>13</sup> But as for me, my prayer is to You, O יהוה, At an acceptable time, O Elohim. In the greatness of Your kindness, Answer me in the truth of Your deliverance.

<sup>14</sup> Rescue me out of the mire, And let me not sink. Let me be rescued from those who hate me, And out of the deep waters.

<sup>15</sup> Let not a flood of waters overflow me, Nor let the deep swallow me up, Nor let the pit shut its mouth on me.

<sup>16</sup> Answer me, O יהוה, for Your kindness is good. According to the greatness of Your compassion, turn to me.

<sup>17</sup> And do not hide Your face from Your servant, For I am in distress; Answer me speedily.

<sup>18</sup> Draw near to my being, redeem it; Ransom me because of my enemies.

<sup>19</sup> You Yourself know my reproach, And my shame and my confusion; My adversaries are all before You.

<sup>20</sup> Reproach has broken my heart and I am sick; I looked for sympathy, but there was none; And for comforters, but I found none.

<sup>21</sup> And they gave me gall for my food, And for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.

<sup>22</sup> Let their table before them become a snare, And a trap to those at ease.

<sup>23</sup> Let their eyes be darkened, so as not to see; And make their loins shake continually.

<sup>24</sup> Pour out Your wrath upon them, And let Your burning displeasure overtake them.

<sup>25</sup> Let their encampments be deserted; Let no one dwell in their tents.

<sup>26</sup> For they persecute him whom You have smitten, And talk about the pain of those You have wounded.

<sup>27</sup> Add crookedness to their crookedness, And let them not enter into Your righteousness.

<sup>28</sup> Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, And not be written with the righteous.

<sup>29</sup> But I am poor and in pain; Let Your deliverance, O Elohim, set me up on high.

<sup>30</sup> I praise the Name of Elohim with a song, And I make Him great with thanksgiving.

<sup>31</sup> And this pleases יהוה more than an ox, A bull with horns and hooves.

<sup>32</sup> The humble shall see, they rejoice, You who seek Elohim, and your hearts live.

<sup>33</sup> For יהוה hears the poor, And He shall not despise His captives.

<sup>34</sup> Let the heavens and earth praise Him, The seas and all that moves in them.

<sup>35</sup> For Elohim shall save Tsiyon And build the cities of Yehuḏah. And they shall dwell there and possess it,

<sup>36</sup> And the seed of His servants inherit it, And those who love His Name dwell in it.
