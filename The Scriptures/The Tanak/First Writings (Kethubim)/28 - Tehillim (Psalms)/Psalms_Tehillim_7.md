<sup>1</sup> O יהוה my Elohim, in You I have taken refuge; Save me from all my pursuers; And deliver me,

<sup>2</sup> Lest they tear at my throat like a lion, Rending in pieces, with no one to deliver.

<sup>3</sup> O יהוה my Elohim, if I have done this: If there is unrighteousness in my hands,

<sup>4</sup> If I have done evil to him who was at peace with me, Or have plundered my enemy without cause,

<sup>5</sup> Let the enemy pursue me and overtake my being, And trample my life to the ground, And lay my esteem in the dust. Selah.

<sup>6</sup> Arise, O יהוה, in Your displeasure; Lift Yourself up against the rage of my adversaries, And awake for me! You shall command judgment!

<sup>7</sup> And let the congregation of the peoples gather about You; And over them return on high.

<sup>8</sup> יהוה judges the peoples; Judge me, O יהוה, according to my righteousness, And according to my integrity within me.

<sup>9</sup> Please let the evil of the wrong be ended, And establish the righteous; For the righteous Elohim is a trier of hearts and kidneys.

<sup>10</sup> My shield is upon Elohim, Who saves the upright in heart.

<sup>11</sup> Elohim is a righteous judge. And Ĕl is enraged every day,

<sup>12</sup> If one does not repent! He sharpens His sword, He bends His bow and makes it ready,

<sup>13</sup> And He has prepared for Himself instruments of death, He makes His arrows hot for pursuers.

<sup>14</sup> See, he who is bound with wickedness, And has conceived trouble and brought forth falsehood,

<sup>15</sup> He has made a pit and dug it out, And falls into the ditch he made!

<sup>16</sup> His trouble turns back upon his own head, And his wrongdoing comes down on the top of his head.

<sup>17</sup> I give thanks to יהוה according to His righteousness, And praise the Name of יהוה Most High.
