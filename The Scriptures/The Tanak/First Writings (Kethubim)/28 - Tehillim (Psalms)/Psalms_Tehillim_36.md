<sup>1</sup> Transgression speaks to the wrong within his heart; Fear of Elohim is not before his eyes.

<sup>2</sup> For he flatters himself in his own eyes, To find his crookedness to be hated.

<sup>3</sup> The words of his mouth are wickedness and deceit; He has ceased to be wise, to do good.

<sup>4</sup> He plots wickedness on his bed; He sets himself in a way that is not good; He does not despise evil.

<sup>5</sup> O יהוה, Your kindness is in the heavens, And Your trustworthiness reaches to the clouds.

<sup>6</sup> Your righteousness is like the mighty mountains; Your right-rulings are a great deep; O יהוה, You save man and beast.

<sup>7</sup> How precious is Your kindness, O Elohim! And the sons of men take refuge in the shadow of Your wings.

<sup>8</sup> They are filled from the fatness of Your house, And You give them drink from the river of Your pleasures.

<sup>9</sup> For with You is the fountain of life; In Your light we see light.

<sup>10</sup> Draw out Your kindness to those who know You, And Your righteousness to the upright in heart.

<sup>11</sup> Let not the foot of pride come against me, And the hand of the wrong drive me away.

<sup>12</sup> There the workers of wickedness have fallen; They have been overthrown And have been unable to rise.
