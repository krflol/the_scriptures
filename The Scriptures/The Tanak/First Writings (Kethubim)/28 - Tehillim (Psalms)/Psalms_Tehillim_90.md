<sup>1</sup> יהוה, You have been our refuge In all generations.

<sup>2</sup> Before the mountains were born, Or You had brought forth the earth and the world, Even from everlasting to everlasting You are Ĕl.

<sup>3</sup> You turn man back to dust, And say, “Return, O children of men.”

<sup>4</sup> For a thousand years in Your eyes Are like yesterday that has past, Or like a watch in the night.

<sup>5</sup> You have swept them away, They are as a sleep, Like grass that springs up in the morning.

<sup>6</sup> At evening it is cut down and withered.

<sup>7</sup> For we have been consumed by Your displeasure, And by Your wrath we are alarmed.

<sup>8</sup> You have set our crookednesses before You, Our secret sin in the light of Your face.

<sup>9</sup> For all our days have passed away in Your wrath, We spend our years like a whisper.

<sup>10</sup> The days of our lives are seventy years; Or if due to strength, eighty years, Yet the best of them is but toil and exertion; For it is soon cut off, and we fly away.

<sup>11</sup> Who knows the power of Your displeasure? And your wrath, according to the fear of You?

<sup>12</sup> Teach us to number our days, And let us bring the heart to wisdom.

<sup>13</sup> Return, O יהוה ! How long? And be sorry for Your servants.

<sup>14</sup> Satisfy us in the morning with Your kindness, And let us sing for joy all our days!

<sup>15</sup> Give us joy according to The days You have afflicted us, The years we have seen evil.

<sup>16</sup> Reveal Your work to Your servants, And Your splendour to their children.

<sup>17</sup> And let the pleasantness Of יהוה our Elohim be upon us, And confirm the work of our hands for us; O confirm the work of our hands!
