<sup>1</sup> O Elohim, deliver me! Hasten to my help, O יהוה !

<sup>2</sup> Let those who seek my life Be ashamed and abashed, Let those who are desiring my evil Be turned back and humiliated.

<sup>3</sup> Let those who say, “Aha, aha!” Be turned back because of their shame.

<sup>4</sup> Let all those who seek You Rejoice and be glad in You; And let those who love Your deliverance always say, “Let Elohim be made great!”

<sup>5</sup> But I am poor and needy; Hasten to me, O Elohim! You are my help and my deliverer; O יהוה, do not delay.
