<sup>1</sup> יהוה said to my Master, “Sit at My right hand, Until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet.”

<sup>2</sup> יהוה sends Your mighty sceptre out of Tsiyon. Rule in the midst of Your enemies!

<sup>3</sup> Your people volunteer in the day of Your might, In the splendours of set-apartness! From the womb, from the morning, You have the dew of Your youth!

<sup>4</sup> יהוה has sworn and does not relent, “You are a priest forever According to the order of Malkitseḏeq.”

<sup>5</sup> יהוה at Your right hand Shall smite sovereigns in the day of His wrath.

<sup>6</sup> He judges among the nations, He shall fill the nations with dead bodies, He shall crush the Head over the mighty earth!

<sup>7</sup> He drinks of the stream by the wayside, Therefore He does lift up the head!
