<sup>1</sup> יהוה does answer you in the day of distress! The Name of the Elohim of Ya‛aqoḇ does set you on high!

<sup>2</sup> He does send you help from the set-apart place, And does uphold you from Tsiyon!

<sup>3</sup> He does remember all your offerings, And does accept your burnt offering! Selah.

<sup>4</sup> He does give you according to your heart, And fills all your plans!

<sup>5</sup> We sing of Your deliverance, And in the Name of our Elohim we set up a banner! יהוה does fill all your requests!

<sup>6</sup> Now I know that יהוה shall save His Anointed; He answers him from His set-apart heavens With the saving might of His right hand.

<sup>7</sup> Some trust in chariots, and some in horses, But we remember the Name of יהוה our Elohim.

<sup>8</sup> They, they have bowed down and fallen; But we have risen and are established.

<sup>9</sup> Save, יהוה ! Let the Sovereign answer us in the day we call.
