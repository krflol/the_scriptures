<sup>1</sup> Do not be silent, O Elohim of my praise!

<sup>2</sup> For the mouth of the wrong And the mouth of the deceiver Have opened against me; They have spoken against me with a false tongue.

<sup>3</sup> They have surrounded me with words of hatred, And they attack me without a cause.

<sup>4</sup> In return for my love they accuse me, While I am in prayer.

<sup>5</sup> And they repay me evil for good, And hatred for my love.

<sup>6</sup> Appoint over him one who is wrong, And let an accuser stand at his right hand.

<sup>7</sup> When he is judged, let him be found wrong, And let his prayer become sin.

<sup>8</sup> Let his days be few, Let another take his office.

<sup>9</sup> Let his children be fatherless, And his wife a widow.

<sup>10</sup> And let his children always wander and beg, And seek food out of their ruins.

<sup>11</sup> Let the creditor lay a snare for all that he has, And let strangers plunder his labour.

<sup>12</sup> Let him have no one to extend kindness, Nor any to show favour to his fatherless children.

<sup>13</sup> Let his descendants be cut off, Their name be blotted out in the next generation.

<sup>14</sup> Let the crookedness of his fathers Be remembered before יהוה, And let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.

<sup>15</sup> Let them always be before יהוה, And let Him cut off their remembrance from the earth;

<sup>16</sup> Because he did not remember to show kindness, But persecuted the poor and needy man; And the broken-hearted, to put to death.

<sup>17</sup> He also loved cursing, so let it come to him; And he did not delight in blessing, so let it be far from him.

<sup>18</sup> And he put cursing on as with his garment, So let it enter his inward parts like water, Into his bones and like oil.

<sup>19</sup> Let it be to him like a cloak he wraps around him, And as a girdle that he always girds on.

<sup>20</sup> This is the reward of my accusers from יהוה, And to those speaking evil against my being.

<sup>21</sup> But You, O יהוה, Master, Deal with me for Your Name’s sake; Because Your kindness is good, deliver me.

<sup>22</sup> For I am poor and needy, And my heart is pierced within me.

<sup>23</sup> I have gone like a lengthening shadow, I have been driven away like a locust.

<sup>24</sup> My knees are weak through fasting, And my flesh grows lean from fatness.

<sup>25</sup> And I, I have become a reproach to them; They see me, they shake their heads.

<sup>26</sup> Help me, O יהוה my Elohim! Save me according to Your kindness,

<sup>27</sup> And let them know that this is Your hand. You, יהוה, You have done it!

<sup>28</sup> Let them curse, but You bless. They shall arise, but be ashamed, And let Your servant rejoice.

<sup>29</sup> Let my accusers put on shame, And be wrapped in their own confusion as in a cloak.

<sup>30</sup> I greatly thank יהוה with my mouth, And I praise Him in the midst of the throng.

<sup>31</sup> For He stands at the right hand of the poor, To save from those judging his being.

<sup>1</sup> Do not be silent, O Elohim of my praise!
