<sup>1</sup> Deliver me from my enemies, O my Elohim; Set me on high from those who rise up against me.

<sup>2</sup> Deliver me from the workers of wickedness, And save me from men of blood.

<sup>3</sup> For look, they have lain in wait for my life; Mighty men assemble against me, For no transgression or sin of mine, O יהוה,

<sup>4</sup> For no guilt of mine! They run and prepare themselves. Awake to help me, and see!

<sup>5</sup> And You, יהוה Elohim of hosts, Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, Awake to punish all the gentiles; Show no favour to any wicked traitors. Selah.

<sup>6</sup> They return at evening, They howl like a dog, And go around the city.

<sup>7</sup> See, they belch out with their mouth, Swords are in their lips, For who is listening?

<sup>8</sup> But You, יהוה, laughs at them, You mock all the gentiles.

<sup>9</sup> O my Strength, I wait for You; For Elohim is my strong tower, My Elohim of kindness.

<sup>10</sup> Elohim does go before me, He lets me look upon my enemies.

<sup>11</sup> Do not slay them, lest my people forget; Scatter them by Your power, And bring them down, O יהוה our shield.

<sup>12</sup> The sin of their mouth is the words of their lips, And they are captured in their pride, And for the cursing and lying they utter.

<sup>13</sup> Bring them to an end in wrath, Bring them to an end, That they be no more; And let them know That Elohim is ruling in Ya‛aqoḇ To the ends of the earth. Selah.

<sup>14</sup> And at evening they return, They howl like a dog, And go around the city.

<sup>15</sup> They wander up and down for food, And whine if they are not satisfied.

<sup>16</sup> And I, I sing of Your power; And in the morning I sing aloud of Your kindness; For You have been my strong tower And a refuge in the day of my distress.

<sup>17</sup> O my Strength, to You I sing praises; For Elohim is my strong tower, My Elohim of kindness.

<sup>1</sup> Deliver me from my enemies, O my Elohim; Set me on high from those who rise up against me.

<sup>2</sup> Deliver me from the workers of wickedness, And save me from men of blood.

<sup>3</sup> For look, they have lain in wait for my life; Mighty men assemble against me, For no transgression or sin of mine, O יהוה,

<sup>6</sup> They return at evening, They howl like a dog, And go around the city.

<sup>7</sup> See, they belch out with their mouth, Swords are in their lips, For who is listening?
