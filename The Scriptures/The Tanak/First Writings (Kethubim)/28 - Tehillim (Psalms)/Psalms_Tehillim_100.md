<sup>1</sup> Raise a shout for יהוה, All the earth!

<sup>2</sup> Serve יהוה with gladness; Come before His presence with singing.

<sup>3</sup> Know that יהוה, He is Elohim; He has made us, and we are His – His people and the sheep of His pasture.

<sup>4</sup> Enter into His gates with thanksgiving, And into His courts with praise. Give thanks to Him; bless His Name.

<sup>5</sup> For יהוה is good; His kindness is everlasting, And His truth, to all generations.
