<sup>1</sup> Ascribe to יהוה, O you sons of the mighty, Ascribe to יהוה esteem and strength.

<sup>2</sup> Ascribe to יהוה the esteem of His Name; Bow yourselves to יהוה in the splendour of set-apartness.

<sup>3</sup> The voice of יהוה is over the waters; The Ĕl of esteem thunders; יהוה is over many waters.

<sup>4</sup> The voice of יהוה is with power, The voice of יהוה is with greatness.

<sup>5</sup> The voice of יהוה is breaking the cedars, יהוה is breaking the cedars of Leḇanon in pieces.

<sup>6</sup> And He makes them skip like a calf, Leḇanon and Siryon like a young wild ox.

<sup>7</sup> The voice of יהוה cuts through the flames of fire.

<sup>8</sup> The voice of יהוה shakes the wilderness; יהוה shakes the Wilderness of Qaḏĕsh.

<sup>9</sup> The voice of יהוה makes the deer give birth, And strips the forests bare; And in His Hĕḵal everyone says, “Esteem!”

<sup>10</sup> יהוה sat enthroned at the Flood, And יהוה sits as Sovereign forever.

<sup>11</sup> יהוה gives strength to His people; יהוה blesses His people with peace.
