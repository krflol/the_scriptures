<sup>1</sup> As a deer longs for the water streams, So my being longs for You, O Elohim.

<sup>2</sup> My being thirsts for Elohim, for the living Ĕl. When shall I enter in to appear before Elohim?

<sup>3</sup> My tears have been my food day and night, While they say to me all day, “Where is your Elohim?”

<sup>4</sup> These I remember, and pour out my being within me. For I used to pass along with the throng; I went with them to the House of Elohim, With the voice of joy and praise, A multitude keeping a festival!

<sup>5</sup> Why are you depressed, O my being? And why are you restless within me? Wait for Elohim: for I shall yet thank Him, For the deliverance of His face!

<sup>6</sup> O my Elohim, my being is depressed within me; Therefore I remember You from the land of the Yardĕn, And from the heights of Ḥermon, From Mount Mits‛ar.

<sup>7</sup> Deep calls to deep at the sound of Your waterfalls; All Your waves and breakers passed over me.

<sup>8</sup> By day יהוה commands His kindness, And by night His song is with me; A prayer to the Ĕl of my life.

<sup>9</sup> I say to Ĕl my Rock, “Why have You forgotten me? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?”

<sup>10</sup> My enemies have reproached me, Like a crushing of my bones, While they say to me all day long, “Where is your Elohim?”

<sup>11</sup> Why are you depressed, O my being? And why are you restless within me? Wait for Elohim: for I shall yet thank Him, the deliverance of my face, And my Elohim.
