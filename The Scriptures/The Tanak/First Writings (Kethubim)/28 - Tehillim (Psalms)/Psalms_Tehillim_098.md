<sup>1</sup> Sing to יהוה a new song! For He has done wonders; His right hand and His set-apart arm Have brought Him deliverance.

<sup>2</sup> יהוה has made known His deliverance; His righteousness He has openly shown Before the eyes of the nations.

<sup>3</sup> He has remembered His kindness And His trustworthiness to the house of Yisra’ĕl; All the ends of the earth have seen The deliverance of our Elohim.

<sup>4</sup> Raise a shout to יהוה, all the earth; Break forth in song, rejoice, and sing praises.

<sup>5</sup> Sing to יהוה with the lyre, With the lyre and the voice of a song,

<sup>6</sup> With trumpets and the sound of a horn; Raise a shout before יהוה, the Sovereign.

<sup>7</sup> Let the sea roar, and all that fills it, The world and those who dwell in it.

<sup>8</sup> Let the rivers clap their hands, Let the mountains sing together for joy before יהוה,

<sup>9</sup> For He shall come to judge the earth. He judges the world in righteousness, And the people in straightness.
