<sup>1</sup> Hear righteousness, יהוה, Listen to my cry; Give ear to my prayer, From lips without deceit.

<sup>2</sup> Let my right-ruling go out from Your presence; Let Your eyes see what is straight.

<sup>3</sup> You have examined my heart; You have visited me in the night; You have tried me – You find I have not schemed; My mouth would not transgress.

<sup>4</sup> As for the deeds of men – By the word of Your lips, I have kept myself from the paths of the destroyer.

<sup>5</sup> My steps have held fast to Your paths, My feet have not slipped.

<sup>6</sup> I have called upon You, for You answer me, O Ĕl; Incline Your ear to me, hear my speech.

<sup>7</sup> Let Your kindness be distinguished, You who save by Your right hand those who take refuge From those who rise up.

<sup>8</sup> Guard me as the apple of Your eye. Hide me under the shadow of Your wings,

<sup>9</sup> From the face of the wrong who ravage me, From my deadly enemies who surround me.

<sup>10</sup> They are enclosed in their own fat, They speak proudly with their mouths,

<sup>11</sup> They have now surrounded us in our steps, They set their eyes to cast us to the ground,

<sup>12</sup> Like a lion who is eager to tear his prey, And as a young lion crouching in cover.

<sup>13</sup> Arise, O יהוה, Confront him, cause him to bend; Deliver my being from the wrong by Your sword,

<sup>14</sup> From men by Your hand, O יהוה, From men of the world whose portion is in this life, And You fill their bellies with Your treasure, They are satisfied with children, And shall leave their riches to their babes.

<sup>15</sup> As for me, let Me see Your face in righteousness; I am satisfied to see Your appearance when I awake.
