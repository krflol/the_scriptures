<sup>1</sup> I cry to You, O יהוה my Rock: Do not be deaf to me! For if You are silent to me, I shall be like those who go down to the pit.

<sup>2</sup> Hear the voice of my prayers when I cry to You, When I lift up my hands Toward Your Set-apart Speaking Place.

<sup>3</sup> Do not draw me away with the wrong And with the workers of wickedness, Who speak peace to their neighbours, But evil is in their hearts.

<sup>4</sup> Give to them according to their deeds, And according to the evil of their practices; Give to them according to the work of their hands; Bring back to them what they deserve.

<sup>5</sup> Because they do not heed the works of יהוה, Nor the works of His hands, He throws them down, And does not build them up.

<sup>6</sup> Blessed be יהוה, Because He has heard the voice of my prayers!

<sup>7</sup> יהוה is my strength, and my shield; My heart has trusted in Him, and I have been helped; Therefore my heart exults, And with my song I thank Him.

<sup>8</sup> יהוה is the strength of His people, And He is the stronghold of deliverance of His anointed.

<sup>9</sup> Save Your people, and bless Your inheritance; And be their Shepherd, and bear them up forever.
