<sup>1</sup> O יהוה, my heart has not been proud, Nor have my eyes been haughty. Neither have I concerned myself with great matters, Nor with those too wondrous for me.

<sup>2</sup> Have I not calmed, and kept my being silent, Like one weaned by its mother? My being is like one weaned.

<sup>3</sup> O Yisra’ĕl, wait for יהוה, Now and forever.
