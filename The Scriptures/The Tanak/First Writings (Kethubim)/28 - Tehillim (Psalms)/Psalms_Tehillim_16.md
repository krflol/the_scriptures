<sup>1</sup> Guard me, O Ĕl, for I have taken refuge in You.

<sup>2</sup> I have said to יהוה, “You are יהוה, I have no good beside You.”

<sup>3</sup> As for the set-apart ones who are on the earth, They are the excellent ones, in whom is all my delight.

<sup>4</sup> The sorrows of those who run after another one are increased; I would not pour out their drink offerings of blood, Nor take up their names on my lips.

<sup>5</sup> יהוה is the portion of my inheritance and my cup; You uphold my lot.

<sup>6</sup> Boundary lines have fallen to me in pleasant places; Indeed, a good inheritance is mine.

<sup>7</sup> I bless יהוה who has given me counsel; My kidneys also instruct me in the nights.

<sup>8</sup> I have set יהוה always before me; Because He is at my right hand I am not shaken.

<sup>9</sup> Therefore my heart was glad, and my esteem rejoices; My flesh also dwells in safety.

<sup>10</sup> For You do not leave my being in the grave, Neither let Your Kind One see corruption.

<sup>11</sup> You show me the path of life; In Your presence is joy to satisfaction; At Your right hand are pleasures forever.
