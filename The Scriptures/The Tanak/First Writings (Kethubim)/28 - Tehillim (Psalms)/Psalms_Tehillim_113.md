<sup>1</sup> Praise Yah! Praise, O servants of יהוה, Praise the Name of יהוה !

<sup>2</sup> Blessed be the Name of יהוה, Now and forever!

<sup>3</sup> From the rising of the sun to its going down, The Name of יהוה is praised.

<sup>4</sup> יהוה is high above all nations, His esteem above the heavens.

<sup>5</sup> Who is like יהוה our Elohim, Who is enthroned on high?

<sup>6</sup> He looks down on the heavens and in the earth;

<sup>7</sup> He raises the poor out of the dust, Lifts the needy from a dunghill,

<sup>8</sup> To make him sit with the nobles, With the nobles of His people,

<sup>9</sup> Causing the barren woman to dwell in a house, A rejoicing mother of children. Praise Yah!
