<sup>1</sup> My Ĕl, My Ĕl, why have You forsaken Me – Far from saving Me, far from the words of My groaning?

<sup>2</sup> O My Elohim, I call by day, but You do not answer; And by night, but I find no rest.

<sup>3</sup> Yet You are set-apart, Enthroned on the praises of Yisra’ĕl.

<sup>4</sup> Our fathers trusted in You; They trusted, and You delivered them.

<sup>5</sup> They cried to You, and were delivered; They trusted in You, and were not ashamed.

<sup>6</sup> But I am a worm, and no man; A reproach of men, and despised by the people.

<sup>7</sup> All those who see Me mock Me; They shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying,

<sup>8</sup> “He trusted in יהוה, let Him rescue Him; Let Him deliver Him, seeing He has delighted in Him!”

<sup>9</sup> For You are the One who took Me out of the womb; Causing Me to trust while on My mother’s breasts.

<sup>10</sup> I was cast upon You from birth. From My mother’s belly You have been My Ĕl.

<sup>11</sup> Do not be far from Me, For distress is near; For there is none to help.

<sup>12</sup> Many bulls have surrounded Me; Strong ones of Bashan have encircled Me.

<sup>13</sup> They have opened their mouths against Me, As a raging and roaring lion.

<sup>14</sup> I have been poured out like water, And all My bones have been spread apart; My heart has become like wax; It has melted in the midst of My inward parts.

<sup>15</sup> My strength is dried like a potsherd, And My tongue is cleaving to My jaws; And to the dust of death You are appointing Me.

<sup>16</sup> For dogs have surrounded Me; A crowd of evil ones have encircled Me, Piercing My hands and My feet;

<sup>17</sup> I count all My bones. They look, they stare at Me.

<sup>18</sup> They divide My garments among them, And for My raiment they cast lots.

<sup>19</sup> But You, O יהוה, do not be far off; O My Strength, hasten to help Me!

<sup>20</sup> Deliver My life from the sword, My only life from the power of the dog.

<sup>21</sup> Save Me from the mouth of the lion, And from the horns of the wild beasts! You have answered Me.

<sup>22</sup> I make known Your Name to My brothers; In the midst of the assembly I praise You.

<sup>23</sup> You who fear יהוה, praise Him! All you seed of Ya‛aqoḇ, esteem Him, And fear Him, all you seed of Yisra’ĕl!

<sup>24</sup> For He has not despised Nor hated the affliction of the afflicted; Nor has He hidden His face from Him; But when He cried to Him, He heard.

<sup>25</sup> From You is My praise in the great assembly; I pay My vows before those who fear Him.

<sup>26</sup> The meek ones do eat and are satisfied; Let those who seek Him praise יהוה. Let your heart live forever!

<sup>27</sup> Let all the ends of the earth Remember and turn to יהוה, And all clans of the nations Bow themselves before You.

<sup>28</sup> For the reign belongs to יהוה, And He is ruling over the nations.

<sup>29</sup> All the fat ones of the earth Shall eat and bow themselves; All who go down to the dust bow before Him, Even he who did not keep alive his own life.

<sup>30</sup> A seed shall serve Him. It is declared of יהוה to the coming generation.

<sup>31</sup> They shall come and declare His righteousness To a people yet to be born, For He shall do it!
