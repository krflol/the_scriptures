<sup>1</sup> When יהוה turns back the captivity of Tsiyon, We shall be like dreamers.

<sup>2</sup> Then our mouth shall be filled with laughter, And our tongue with singing, Then shall they say among the gentiles, “ יהוה has done great deeds for them.”

<sup>3</sup> יהוה shall do great deeds for us, We shall be glad.

<sup>4</sup> Turn back our captivity, O יהוה, Like the streams in the South.

<sup>5</sup> Those sowing in tears, shall reap with songs of joy.

<sup>6</sup> He who goes on and weeps, Bearing seed for sowing, Shall indeed come in with rejoicing, Bearing his sheaves.
