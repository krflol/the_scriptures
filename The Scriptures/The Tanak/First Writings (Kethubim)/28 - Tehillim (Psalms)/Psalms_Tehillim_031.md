<sup>1</sup> In You, O יהוה, I have taken refuge; Let me never be ashamed; Deliver me in Your righteousness.

<sup>2</sup> Incline Your ear to me, Deliver me speedily; Be a rock of refuge to me, A house of defence to save me.

<sup>3</sup> For You are my rock and my stronghold; For Your Name’s sake lead me and guide me.

<sup>4</sup> Bring me out of the net which they have hidden for me, For You are my stronghold.

<sup>5</sup> Into Your hand I commit my spirit; You have redeemed me, O יהוה Ĕl of truth.

<sup>6</sup> I have hated those who observe lying vanities; But I trust in יהוה.

<sup>7</sup> I exult and rejoice in Your kindness, For You have seen my affliction; You have known the distresses of my life,

<sup>8</sup> And You have not shut me up into the hand of the enemy. You have set my feet in a large place.

<sup>9</sup> Show me favour, O יהוה, for I am in distress; My eye, my being and my body have become old with grief!

<sup>10</sup> For my life is consumed in sorrow, And my years in sighing; My strength fails because of my crookedness, And my bones have become old.

<sup>11</sup> I am a reproach among all my adversaries, But most of all among my neighbours, And a dread to my friends; Those who see me outside flee from me.

<sup>12</sup> I have been forgotten like someone dead from the heart; I have been like a missing vessel.

<sup>13</sup> For I hear the evil report of many; Fear is from all around; When they take counsel together against me, They plot to take away my life.

<sup>14</sup> But I, I have put my trust in You, O יהוה ; I have said, “You are my Elohim.”

<sup>15</sup> My times are in Your hand; Deliver me from the hand of my enemies, And from those who pursue me.

<sup>16</sup> Make Your face shine upon Your servant; Save me in Your kindness.

<sup>17</sup> Do not let me be ashamed, O יהוה, For I have called upon You; Let the wrong be ashamed; Let them be silenced in the grave.

<sup>18</sup> Let lips of falsehood be stilled, Which speak recklessly against the righteous, With pride and scorn.

<sup>19</sup> How great is Your goodness, Which You have laid up for those fearing You, Which You have prepared for those taking refuge in You In the sight of the sons of men!

<sup>20</sup> In the secrecy of Your presence You shall hide them from the plots of man; You shelter them in a booth from the strife of tongues.

<sup>21</sup> Blessed be יהוה, For He has made marvellous His kindness to me in a strong city!

<sup>22</sup> And I, I have said in my haste, “I am cut off from before Your eyes,” Yet You heard the voice of my prayers When I cried out to You.

<sup>23</sup> Love יהוה, all you His kind ones! For יהוה guards the trustworthy ones, And exceedingly repays the doer of pride.

<sup>24</sup> Be strong, and let Him strengthen your heart, All you who are waiting for יהוה.
