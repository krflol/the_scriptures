<sup>1</sup> O יהוה, Elohim of my deliverance, By day I have cried out, In the night also before You,

<sup>2</sup> Let my prayer come before You, Incline Your ear to my cry.

<sup>3</sup> For my being is filled with evils, And my life draws near to the grave.

<sup>4</sup> I have been reckoned among those Who go down to the pit; I have become like a man Who has no strength,

<sup>5</sup> Released among the dead, Like slain ones lying in the grave, Whom You have remembered no more, And who have been cut off from Your hand.

<sup>6</sup> You have put me in the lowest pit, In dark places, in the depths.

<sup>7</sup> Your wrath has rested heavily upon me, And You have afflicted me with all Your breakers. Selah.

<sup>8</sup> You have put away my friends far from me; You have made me an abomination to them; I am shut in and do not go out;

<sup>9</sup> My eye grows dim because of affliction. יהוה, I have called upon You, all day long; I have stretched out my hands to You.

<sup>10</sup> Would You work wonders for the dead? Would the dead rise to praise You? Selah.

<sup>11</sup> Is Your kindness declared in the grave? Your trustworthiness in the place of destruction?

<sup>12</sup> Are Your wonders known in the dark? And Your righteousness in the land of no remembrance?

<sup>13</sup> But I, unto You I have cried, O יהוה, And in the morning my prayer comes before You.

<sup>14</sup> יהוה, why do You reject me? Why do You hide Your face from me?

<sup>15</sup> I am afflicted and dying from childhood; I have borne frightening matters from You; I am in despair.

<sup>16</sup> Your fierce wrath has gone over me; Your onslaughts have cut me off.

<sup>17</sup> They surrounded me like water all day long; They close in upon me altogether.

<sup>18</sup> You have put loved one and companion far from me, Darkness is my close friend!
