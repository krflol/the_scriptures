<sup>1</sup> O יהוה, hear my prayer, And let my cry come to You.

<sup>2</sup> Do not hide Your face from me In the day of my distress; Incline Your ear to me; In the day I call, answer me speedily.

<sup>3</sup> For my days are consumed like smoke, And my bones are burned like a hearth.

<sup>4</sup> My heart is stricken and withered like grass, For I have forgotten to eat my bread.

<sup>5</sup> Because of the sound of my sighing My bones have cleaved to my flesh.

<sup>6</sup> I have been like a pelican of the wilderness, I have been like an owl of the desert.

<sup>7</sup> I have watched, and I am As a bird alone on the house-top.

<sup>8</sup> My enemies reproached me all day long, Those who rave against me have sworn against me.

<sup>9</sup> For I have eaten ashes like bread, And mixed my drink with tears,

<sup>10</sup> Because of Your displeasure and Your wrath; For You have lifted me up And thrown me down.

<sup>11</sup> My days are like a shadow that lengthens, And I wither away like grass.

<sup>12</sup> But You, O יהוה, shall be enthroned forever, And the remembrance of You be to all generations.

<sup>13</sup> You Yourself shall arise And have compassion on Tsiyon, For the time to favour her, The appointed time, has come.

<sup>14</sup> For Your servants have been pleased with her stones, And they favour her dust.

<sup>15</sup> And the nations shall fear the Name of יהוה, And all the sovereigns of the earth Your esteem,

<sup>16</sup> For יהוה shall build up Tsiyon, He shall appear in His esteem.

<sup>17</sup> He shall turn unto the prayer of the destitute, And He shall not despise their prayer.

<sup>18</sup> This is written for a generation to come, So that a people to be created praise Yah.

<sup>19</sup> For He looked down From the height of His set-apart place; From heaven יהוה viewed the earth,

<sup>20</sup> To hear the groaning of the prisoner, To release those appointed to death,

<sup>21</sup> To declare the Name of יהוה in Tsiyon, And His praise in Yerushalayim,

<sup>22</sup> When peoples gather together, And reigns, to serve יהוה.

<sup>23</sup> He has humbled my strength in the way; He has shortened my days.

<sup>24</sup> I said, “O my Ĕl, Do not take me away in the midst of my days; Your years are throughout all generations.

<sup>25</sup> “You did found the earth of old, And the heavens are the work of Your hands.

<sup>26</sup> “They shall perish, but You remain; And all of them grow old like a garment; You change them like a coat, And they are changed.

<sup>27</sup> “But You are the same, And Your years have no end.

<sup>28</sup> “The sons of Your servants continue, And their seed is established before You.”
