<sup>1</sup> Praise Yah! For it is good to sing praises to our Elohim. For it is pleasant – praise is fitting.

<sup>2</sup> יהוה builds up Yerushalayim, He gathers the outcasts of Yisra’ĕl –

<sup>3</sup> He heals the broken-hearted And binds up their wounds.

<sup>4</sup> He appoints the number of the stars, He gives names to all of them.

<sup>5</sup> Great is our Master and mighty in power, There is no limit to His understanding.

<sup>6</sup> יהוה lifts up the meek ones, He throws the wrong ones down to the ground.

<sup>7</sup> Respond to יהוה with thanksgiving; Sing praises on a lyre to our Elohim,

<sup>8</sup> Who covers the heavens with clouds, Who prepares rain for the earth, Who makes grass to sprout on the mountains,

<sup>9</sup> Giving to the beast its food, To the young ravens that cry.

<sup>10</sup> He does not delight in the strength of the horse, He takes no pleasure in the legs of a man.

<sup>11</sup> יהוה takes pleasure in those who fear Him, In those who wait for His kindness.

<sup>12</sup> Extol יהוה, O Yerushalayim! Praise your Elohim, O Tsiyon!

<sup>13</sup> For He has strengthened the bars of your gates, He has blessed your children in your midst,

<sup>14</sup> Who makes peace in your borders, He satisfies you with the finest wheat;

<sup>15</sup> Who sends out His command to the earth, His word runs very speedily;

<sup>16</sup> Who gives snow like wool, He scatters the frost like ashes;

<sup>17</sup> Throwing out His hail like pieces; Who does stand before His cold?

<sup>18</sup> He sends out His word and melts them, He causes His wind to blow – the waters flow;

<sup>19</sup> Declaring His Word to Ya‛aqoḇ, His laws and His right-rulings to Yisra’ĕl.

<sup>20</sup> He has not done so with any nation; And they have not known His right-rulings! Praise Yah!
