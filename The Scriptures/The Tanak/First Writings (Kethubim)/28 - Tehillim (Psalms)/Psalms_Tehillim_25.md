<sup>1</sup> To You, O יהוה, I lift up my being.

<sup>2</sup> O my Elohim, in You I have put my trust; Let me not be ashamed; Let not my enemies exult over me.

<sup>3</sup> Indeed, let no one who waits on You be ashamed; Let those who are treacherous without cause be ashamed.

<sup>4</sup> Show me Your ways, O יהוה ; Teach me Your paths.

<sup>5</sup> Lead me in Your truth and teach me, For You are the Elohim of my deliverance; On You I wait all the day.

<sup>6</sup> Remember, O יהוה, Your compassion and Your kindnesses, For they are from everlasting.

<sup>7</sup> Do not remember the sins of my youth, and my transgressions; According to Your kindness remember me, For Your goodness’ sake, O יהוה.

<sup>8</sup> Good and straight is יהוה ; Therefore He teaches sinners in the way.

<sup>9</sup> He guides the meek ones in right-ruling, And He teaches the meek ones His way.

<sup>10</sup> All the paths of יהוה are kindness and truth, To those who guard His covenant and His witnesses.

<sup>11</sup> For Your Name’s sake, O יהוה, You shall pardon my crookedness, though it is great.

<sup>12</sup> Who, then, is the man that fears יהוה ? He teaches him in the way he should choose.

<sup>13</sup> His life dwells in good, And his seed inherits the earth.

<sup>14</sup> The secret of יהוה is with those who fear Him, And He makes His covenant known to them.

<sup>15</sup> My eyes are ever toward יהוה, For He brings my feet out of the net.

<sup>16</sup> Turn Your face to me, and show me favour, For I am lonely and afflicted.

<sup>17</sup> The distresses of my heart have enlarged; Oh, bring me out of my distresses!

<sup>18</sup> Look on my affliction and my toil, And forgive all my sins.

<sup>19</sup> See how many my enemies have become; And they hate me with a violent hatred.

<sup>20</sup> Oh, guard my life, and deliver me; Let me not be ashamed, for I have taken refuge in You.

<sup>21</sup> Let integrity and straightness guard me, For I have waited for You.

<sup>22</sup> Redeem Yisra’ĕl, O Elohim, Out of all his distresses!
