<sup>1</sup> Give ear, O Shepherd of Yisra’ĕl, Who lead Yosĕph like a flock; Who dwell between the keruḇim, shine forth!

<sup>2</sup> Before Ephrayim, Binyamin, and Menashsheh, Stir up Your might, And come and save us!

<sup>3</sup> Cause us to turn back, O Elohim, And cause Your face to shine, That we might be saved!

<sup>4</sup> O יהוה Elohim of hosts, How long shall You be wroth Against the prayer of Your people?

<sup>5</sup> You have caused them to eat the bread of tears, And have caused them to drink With tears, a third time.

<sup>6</sup> You have made us a strife to our neighbours, And our enemies laugh among themselves.

<sup>7</sup> Turn us back, O Elohim of hosts, And cause Your face to shine, That we might be saved!

<sup>8</sup> You brought a vine out of Mitsrayim; You drove out the nations, and planted it.

<sup>9</sup> You cleared a place for it, And caused it to take deep root, And it filled the land.

<sup>10</sup> Hills were covered with its shadow, And the mighty cedars with its twigs.

<sup>11</sup> She spread her branches to the Sea, And her shoots to the River.

<sup>12</sup> Why have You broken down her hedges, So that every passer-by plucked her fruit?

<sup>13</sup> The boar out of the forest ravages it, And the wild beast of the field devours it.

<sup>14</sup> Return, we beg You, O Elohim of hosts; Look down from heaven, and see, And visit this vine,

<sup>15</sup> And the stock which Your right hand has planted, And the Son whom You made strong for Yourself.

<sup>16</sup> It is burned with fire, it is cut down; They perish at the rebuke of Your face.

<sup>17</sup> Let Your hand be upon the One at Your right hand, Upon the Son of Aḏam whom You made strong for Yourself,

<sup>18</sup> And we shall not backslide from You. Revive us, and let us call upon Your Name.

<sup>19</sup> Turn us back, O יהוה Elohim of hosts, And cause Your face to shine, That we might be saved!
