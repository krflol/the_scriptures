<sup>1</sup> O יהוה, remember Dawiḏ, All his afflictions;

<sup>2</sup> How he swore to יהוה, Vowed to the Mighty One of Ya‛aqoḇ:

<sup>3</sup> “Not to enter into my dwelling-house, Not to get into my bed,

<sup>4</sup> “Not to give sleep to my eyes, Or slumber to my eyelids,

<sup>5</sup> “Until I find a place for יהוה, A dwelling place for the Mighty One of Ya‛aqoḇ.”

<sup>6</sup> See, we heard of it in Ephrathah; We found it in the fields of the forest.

<sup>7</sup> Let us go into His dwelling places; Let us bow ourselves at His footstool.

<sup>8</sup> Arise, O יהוה, to Your place of rest, You and the ark of Your strength.

<sup>9</sup> Let Your priests put on righteousness, And Your kind ones shout for joy.

<sup>10</sup> For the sake of Your servant Dawiḏ, Do not turn away the face of Your Anointed One.

<sup>11</sup> יהוה has sworn in truth to Dawiḏ; He does not turn from it, “Of the fruit of your body I set upon your throne.

<sup>12</sup> “If your sons guard My covenant And My witnesses that I teach them, Their sons shall sit upon your throne forever.”

<sup>13</sup> For יהוה has chosen Tsiyon, He has desired it for His dwelling:

<sup>14</sup> “This is My place of rest forever; Here I dwell, for I have desired it.

<sup>15</sup> “I greatly bless her provision, I satisfy her poor with bread.

<sup>16</sup> “And I put deliverance on her priests, And her kind ones sing for joy.

<sup>17</sup> “There I make the horn of Dawiḏ grow; I shall set up a lamp for My Anointed One.

<sup>18</sup> “I put shame on his enemies, While on Him His diadem shall shine.”
