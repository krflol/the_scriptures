<sup>1</sup> O Elohim, give the sovereign Your right-rulings, And Your righteousness to the Son of a sovereign.

<sup>2</sup> Let Him rule Your people with righteousness, And Your poor with right-ruling.

<sup>3</sup> Let the mountains bring peace to the people, And the hills, by righteousness.

<sup>4</sup> Let Him rightly rule the poor of the people, Save the children of the needy, And crush the oppressor.

<sup>5</sup> Let them fear You with the sun, shining And before the moon, in all generations.

<sup>6</sup> Let Him come down like rain upon the mown grass, Like showers, watering the earth.

<sup>7</sup> Let the righteous flourish in His days, With plenty of peace, Till the moon is no more.

<sup>8</sup> And let Him rule from sea to sea, And from the River to the ends of the earth.

<sup>9</sup> Let those dwelling in the desert bow before Him, And His enemies lick the dust.

<sup>10</sup> Let the sovereigns of Tarshish and of the isles bring presents; The sovereigns of Sheḇa and Seḇa offer gifts.

<sup>11</sup> And let all sovereigns bow down before Him, All nations serve Him.

<sup>12</sup> For He delivers the needy when he cries, And the poor, who has no helper.

<sup>13</sup> He spares the poor and needy, And He saves the lives of the needy.

<sup>14</sup> He redeems their life from oppression and from violence; And their blood is precious in His eyes.

<sup>15</sup> And He shall live, And the gold of Sheḇa be given to Him, And prayer be made for Him continually; Let Him be blessed all day long.

<sup>16</sup> Let there be plenty of grain in the earth, On the top of the mountains, Let its fruit wave like Leḇanon, And those of the city flourish like grass of the earth.

<sup>17</sup> Let His Name be forever, His Name continue before the sun; And let them bless themselves in Him; Let all nations call Him blessed.

<sup>18</sup> Blessed be יהוה Elohim, Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, He alone is doing wonders!

<sup>19</sup> And blessed be His esteemed Name forever! And let all the earth Be filled with His esteem. Amĕn and Amĕn.

<sup>20</sup> The prayers of Dawiḏ the son of Yishai are ended.
