<sup>1</sup> I exalt You, my Elohim, O Sovereign; And bless Your Name forever and ever.

<sup>2</sup> All day long I bless You, And praise Your Name forever and ever.

<sup>3</sup> Great is יהוה, and greatly to be praised; And His greatness is unsearchable.

<sup>4</sup> Generation after generation praise Your works, And they declare Your mighty acts.

<sup>5</sup> I declare the esteemed splendour of Your excellency, And the matters of Your wondrous works.

<sup>6</sup> And they speak of the might of Your awesome acts, And I recount Your greatness.

<sup>7</sup> They send forth the remembrance of Your great goodness, And they sing of Your righteousness.

<sup>8</sup> יהוה shows favour and is compassionate, Patient and great in kindness.

<sup>9</sup> יהוה is good to all, And He has compassion on all His works.

<sup>10</sup> All Your works give thanks to You, O יהוה, And Your kind ones bless You.

<sup>11</sup> They speak of the esteem of Your reign, And talk of Your might,

<sup>12</sup> To make known to the sons of men His mighty acts, And the esteemed splendour of His reign.

<sup>13</sup> Your reign is an everlasting reign, And Your rule is throughout all generations.

<sup>14</sup> יהוה is supporting all who are falling, And raising up all who are bowed down.

<sup>15</sup> The eyes of all look to You expectantly, And You are giving them their food in its season,

<sup>16</sup> Opening Your hand and satisfying The desire of all that live.

<sup>17</sup> יהוה is righteous in all His ways, And kind in all His works.

<sup>18</sup> יהוה is near to all who call upon Him, To all who call upon Him in truth.

<sup>19</sup> He does the desire of those who fear Him; And He hears their cry and saves them.

<sup>20</sup> יהוה preserves all those loving Him, But all the wrong ones He destroys.

<sup>21</sup> My mouth speaks the praise of יהוה, And let all flesh bless His set-apart Name, Forever and ever.
