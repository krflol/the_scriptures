<sup>1</sup> Out of the depths I have cried to You, O יהוה.

<sup>2</sup> O יהוה, hear my voice! Let Your ears be attentive To the voice of my prayers.

<sup>3</sup> O Yah, if You should watch crookednesses, O יהוה, who would stand?

<sup>4</sup> But with You there is forgiveness, That You might be feared.

<sup>5</sup> I looked to יהוה, My being has looked, And for His word I have waited.

<sup>6</sup> My being looks to יהוה More than those watching for morning, watching for morning.

<sup>7</sup> O Yisra’ĕl, wait for יהוה ; For with יהוה there is kindness. And with Him is much redemption,

<sup>8</sup> For He shall redeem Yisra’ĕl From all his crookednesses.
