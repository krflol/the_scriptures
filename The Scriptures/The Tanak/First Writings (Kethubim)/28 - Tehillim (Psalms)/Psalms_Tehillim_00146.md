<sup>1</sup> Praise Yah! Praise יהוה, O my being!

<sup>2</sup> While I live I praise יהוה ; I sing praises to my Elohim while I exist.

<sup>3</sup> Do not put your trust in princes, In a son of man, in whom is no deliverance.

<sup>4</sup> His spirit goes out, he returns to his earth; In that day his plans perish.

<sup>5</sup> Blessed is he who has the Ĕl of Ya‛aqoḇ for his help, Whose expectancy is in יהוה his Elohim,

<sup>6</sup> Maker of the heavens and earth, The sea and all that is in them, Who is guarding truth forever,

<sup>7</sup> Doing right-ruling for the oppressed, Giving bread to the hungry. יהוה releases those who are bound,

<sup>8</sup> יהוה opens the eyes of the blind, יהוה raises those who are bowed down, יהוה loves the righteous.

<sup>9</sup> יהוה guards the strangers, He lifts up the fatherless and widow, But the way of the wrong ones He turns upside down.

<sup>10</sup> יהוה reigns forever, O Tsiyon, Your Elohim to all generations. Praise Yah!
