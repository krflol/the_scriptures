<sup>1</sup> I love יהוה, because He has heard my voice, my pleas.

<sup>2</sup> Because He has inclined His ear to me, And I shall call throughout my days.

<sup>3</sup> The cords of death were around me, And the pains of the grave came upon me; I found distress and sorrow.

<sup>4</sup> Then I called upon the Name of יהוה, “O יהוה, I pray to You, deliver my being!”

<sup>5</sup> יהוה shows favour and is righteous; And our Elohim is compassionate.

<sup>6</sup> יהוה guards the simple; I was brought low, but He saved me.

<sup>7</sup> Return to your rest, O my being, For יהוה has treated you well.

<sup>8</sup> For You have delivered my being from death, My eyes from tears, My feet from falling.

<sup>9</sup> I shall walk before יהוה in the land of the living.

<sup>10</sup> I have believed, for I speak; I have been greatly afflicted.

<sup>11</sup> I said in my haste, “All men are liars.”

<sup>12</sup> What shall I return to יהוה ? All His bounties are upon me.

<sup>13</sup> I lift up the cup of deliverance, And call upon the Name of יהוה.

<sup>14</sup> I pay my vows to יהוה Now in the presence of all His people.

<sup>15</sup> Precious in the eyes of יהוה Is the death of His kind ones.

<sup>16</sup> O יהוה, I am truly Your servant, I am Your servant, the son of Your female servant; You have loosed my bonds.

<sup>17</sup> I bring You a slaughtering of thanksgiving, And call upon the Name of יהוה.

<sup>18</sup> I pay my vows to יהוה In the presence of all His people,

<sup>19</sup> In the courts of the House of יהוה, In your midst, O Yerushalayim. Praise Yah!
