<sup>1</sup> I have said,“Let me guard my ways Against sinning with my tongue; Let me guard my mouth with a muzzle, While the wrongdoer is before me.”

<sup>2</sup> I became dumb, keeping still; I was silent, from good; And my pain was stirred.

<sup>3</sup> My heart was hot within me; While I was meditating, the fire burned. Then I spoke with my tongue:

<sup>4</sup> “ יהוה, let me know my end, And the measure of my days, what it is, Let me know how short-lived I am.

<sup>5</sup> “See, You have made my days as handbreadths, And my lifetime is as non-existence before You; Only, all men standing, are all breath. Selah.

<sup>6</sup> “As but a shadow each one walks; They busy themselves, only in vain; He heaps up wealth, But knows not who gathers them.

<sup>7</sup> “And now, יהוה, what do I wait for? My expectancy is in You.

<sup>8</sup> “Deliver me from all my transgressions; Do not make me the reproach of the foolish.

<sup>9</sup> “I was dumb, I did not open my mouth, Because it was You who did it.

<sup>10</sup> “Turn aside Your stroke from me; I am overcome by the blow of Your hand.

<sup>11</sup> “When You chastise man for crookedness with reproofs, You consume what he loves, like a moth; All men are but a breath. Selah.

<sup>12</sup> “Hear my prayer, O יהוה, And give ear to my cry; Do not be silent at my tears; For I am a stranger with You, A sojourner, as all my fathers were.

<sup>13</sup> “Look away from me, That I might brighten up, Before I go away and am no more.”
