<sup>1</sup> Do not fret because of evil-doers, Do not be envious of the workers of unrighteousness.

<sup>2</sup> For they soon wither like grass, And fade like green plants.

<sup>3</sup> Trust in יהוה, and do good; Dwell in the earth, and feed on steadfastness.

<sup>4</sup> And delight yourself in יהוה, And let Him give you the desires of your heart.

<sup>5</sup> Commit your way to יהוה, And trust in Him, and He does it.

<sup>6</sup> And He shall bring forth your righteousness as the light, And your right-ruling as midday.

<sup>7</sup> Rest in יהוה, and wait patiently for Him; Do not fret because of him who prospers in his way, Because of the man doing wicked devices.

<sup>8</sup> Abstain from displeasure, and forsake wrath; Do not fret, also to do evil.

<sup>9</sup> For evil-doers are cut off; But those who wait on יהוה, They shall inherit the earth.

<sup>10</sup> Yet a little while and the wrong is no more; And you shall look on his place, But it is not.

<sup>11</sup> But the meek ones shall inherit the earth, And delight themselves in plenty of peace.

<sup>12</sup> The wrong plots against the righteous, And gnashes his teeth at him.

<sup>13</sup> יהוה laughs at him, For He sees that his day is coming.

<sup>14</sup> The wrong have drawn the sword And have bent their bow, To cause the poor and needy to fall, To slay those who walk straightly.

<sup>15</sup> Their sword does enter into their own heart, And their bows are broken.

<sup>16</sup> Better is the little of the righteous one, Than the riches of many wrongdoers.

<sup>17</sup> For the arms of the wrongdoers are broken, But יהוה sustains the righteous.

<sup>18</sup> יהוה knows the days of the perfect, And their inheritance is forever.

<sup>19</sup> They are not ashamed in a time of evil, And in the days of scarcity of food they are satisfied.

<sup>20</sup> But the wrongdoers shall perish; And the enemies of יהוה, Like the splendour of the meadows they vanish, Like smoke they vanish away.

<sup>21</sup> The wrongdoer is borrowing and does not repay, But the righteous one shows favour and gives.

<sup>22</sup> For His blessed ones inherit the earth, But those cursed by Him are cut off.

<sup>23</sup> The steps of a man are ordered by יהוה, And He delights in his way.

<sup>24</sup> Though he falls, he is not cast down, For יהוה is supporting his hand.

<sup>25</sup> I have been young, and now I am old; Yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken, Or his seed begging bread.

<sup>26</sup> All day long he is showing favour and lending; And his seed is for a blessing.

<sup>27</sup> Turn away from evil, and do good; And dwell forever.

<sup>28</sup> For יהוה loves right-ruling, And does not forsake His kind ones; They shall be guarded forever, But the seed of the wrongdoers is cut off.

<sup>29</sup> The righteous shall inherit the earth, And dwell in it forever.

<sup>30</sup> The mouth of the righteous speaks wisdom, And his tongue talks of right-ruling.

<sup>31</sup> The Torah of his Elohim is in his heart; His steps do not slide.

<sup>32</sup> The wrong one is watching for the righteous, And is seeking to slay him.

<sup>33</sup> יהוה does not leave him in his hand, Or let him be declared wrong when he is judged.

<sup>34</sup> Wait on יהוה and guard His way, And He shall exalt you to inherit the earth – When the wrongdoers are cut off, you shall see it.

<sup>35</sup> I have seen the wrongdoer in great power, And spreading himself like a native green tree.

<sup>36</sup> Yet he passed away, and see, he was not; And I sought him, but he was not found.

<sup>37</sup> Watch the perfect, and observe the straight; For the latter end of each is peace.

<sup>38</sup> But the transgressors shall be destroyed together; The latter end of the wrong shall be cut off.

<sup>39</sup> But the deliverance of the righteous is from יהוה, Their strength in time of distress.

<sup>40</sup> And יהוה does help them and deliver them; He delivers them from the wrongdoers and saves them, Because they took refuge in Him.

<sup>1</sup> Do not fret because of evil-doers, Do not be envious of the workers of unrighteousness.

<sup>2</sup> For they soon wither like grass, And fade like green plants.

<sup>3</sup> Trust in יהוה, and do good; Dwell in the earth, and feed on steadfastness.

<sup>4</sup> And delight yourself in יהוה, And let Him give you the desires of your heart.

<sup>5</sup> Commit your way to יהוה, And trust in Him, and He does it.

<sup>6</sup> And He shall bring forth your righteousness as the light, And your right-ruling as midday.
