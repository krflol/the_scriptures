<sup>1</sup> יהוה, who does sojourn in Your Tent? Who does dwell in Your set-apart mountain?

<sup>2</sup> He who walks blamelessly, And does righteousness, And speaks the truth in his heart.

<sup>3</sup> He has not slandered with his tongue, He has not done evil to his neighbour, Nor lifted up a reproach against his friend;

<sup>4</sup> In whose eyes a reprobate one is despised, But he esteems those who fear יהוה ; He who swears to his own hurt and does not change;

<sup>5</sup> He has not put out his silver at interest, And has not taken a bribe against the innocent. He who does these is never moved.
