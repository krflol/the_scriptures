<sup>1</sup> O Elohim, You are my Ä”l; I earnestly seek You; My being has thirsted for You; My flesh has longed for You In a dry and thirsty land without water.

<sup>2</sup> Therefore I have had a vision of You In the set-apart place, To see Your power and Your esteem.

<sup>3</sup> Because Your kindness is better than life, My lips do praise You.

<sup>4</sup> Therefore I bless You while I live; In Your Name I lift up my hands.

<sup>5</sup> My being is satisfied as with marrow and fat, And my mouth praises You with singing lips.

<sup>6</sup> When I remember You on my bed, I meditate on You in the night watches.

<sup>7</sup> For You have been my help, And in the shadow of Your wings I sing.

<sup>8</sup> My being has closely followed You; Your right hand did uphold me.

<sup>9</sup> But those who seek to destroy my life, Go into the lower parts of the earth.

<sup>10</sup> They are handed over To the power of the sword; They become a portion for jackals.

<sup>11</sup> But let the sovereign rejoice in Elohim; Let everyone who swears by Him exult; For the mouth of those speaking lies are stopped.
