<sup>1</sup> Bless יהוה, O my being! O יהוה my Elohim, You have been very great: You have put on excellency and splendour,

<sup>2</sup> Covering Yourself with light as with a garment, Stretching out the heavens like a curtain,

<sup>3</sup> Who is laying the beams of His upper rooms in the waters, Who is making thick clouds His chariot, Who is walking on the wings of the wind,

<sup>4</sup> Making His messengers the winds, His servants a flame of fire.

<sup>5</sup> He established the earth on its foundations, So that it would not totter forever,

<sup>6</sup> You covered it with the deep as with a garment; The waters stood above the mountains.

<sup>7</sup> At Your rebuke they flee; At the voice of Your thunder they hurry away.

<sup>8</sup> They go up the mountains; They go down the valleys, To the place which You founded for them.

<sup>9</sup> You did set a boundary, they do not pass over, They do not return to cover the earth.

<sup>10</sup> Who is sending the springs into the valleys, They flow among the hills.

<sup>11</sup> They give drink to every beast of the field; Wild donkeys break their thirst.

<sup>12</sup> The birds of the heavens dwell beside them; They sing from between the branches.

<sup>13</sup> Watering the hills from His upper rooms; The earth is satisfied with the fruit of Your works.

<sup>14</sup> Causing the grass to grow for the cattle, And plants for the service of mankind, To bring forth food from the earth,

<sup>15</sup> And wine that makes glad the heart of man, Oil to make the face shine, And bread which sustains man’s heart.

<sup>16</sup> The trees of יהוה are satisfied, The cedars of Leḇanon which He planted,

<sup>17</sup> Where the birds do make nests; The stork has her home in the fir trees.

<sup>18</sup> The high hills are for wild goats; Rocks a refuge for rock badgers.

<sup>19</sup> He made the moon for appointed times; The sun knows its going down.

<sup>20</sup> You put darkness, and it is night, In it all the beasts of the forest creep.

<sup>21</sup> The young lions are roaring for prey, And seeking their food from Ĕl.

<sup>22</sup> The sun arises – they withdraw And lie down in their dens.

<sup>23</sup> Man goes out to his work, And to his labour, till evening.

<sup>24</sup> O יהוה, how many have been Your works! You have made all of them in wisdom. The earth is filled with Your possessions.

<sup>25</sup> There is the sea, great and wide, In which are innumerable swarms, Living creatures, small with great.

<sup>26</sup> There do ships go; That Liwiathan which You made, to play there.

<sup>27</sup> All of them wait for You, To give their food in due season.

<sup>28</sup> You give to them, they gather in; You open Your hand, they are satisfied with good.

<sup>29</sup> You hide Your face, they are alarmed; You take away their breath, they die and return to their dust;

<sup>30</sup> You send forth Your Spirit, they are created; And You renew the face of the earth.

<sup>31</sup> The esteem of יהוה is forever, יהוה rejoices in His works,

<sup>32</sup> Who looks on the earth, and it trembles; He touches the mountains, and they smoke.

<sup>33</sup> I sing to יהוה as long as I live, I sing praise to my Elohim while I exist.

<sup>34</sup> My meditation on Him is sweet; I rejoice in יהוה.

<sup>35</sup> Let sinners be consumed from the earth, And let the wrong be no more. Bless יהוה, O my being! Praise Yah!
