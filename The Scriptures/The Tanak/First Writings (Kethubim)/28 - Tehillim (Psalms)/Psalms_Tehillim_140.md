<sup>1</sup> Rescue me, O יהוה, from men of evil; Preserve me from men of violence,

<sup>2</sup> Who have devised evils in their hearts; They stir up conflicts all day long.

<sup>3</sup> They sharpen their tongues like a snake; The poison of cobras is under their lips. Selah.

<sup>4</sup> Guard me, O יהוה, from the hands of the wrong; Guard me from a man of violence, Who have schemed to trip up my steps.

<sup>5</sup> The proud have hidden a trap for me, and cords; They have spread a net by the wayside; They have set snares for me. Selah.

<sup>6</sup> I said to יהוה, “You are my Ĕl; Hear the voice of my prayers, O יהוה.

<sup>7</sup> “O Master יהוה, my saving strength, You have screened my head in the day of battle.

<sup>8</sup> “Do not grant the desires of the wrong, O יהוה ; Do not promote his scheme. Selah.

<sup>9</sup> “Those who surround me lift up their head; The trouble of their lips cover them;

<sup>10</sup> “Let burning coals fall on them; Let them be made to fall into the fire, Into deep pits, let them not rise again.

<sup>11</sup> “Let not a slanderer be established in the earth; Let evil hunt the man of violence speedily.”

<sup>12</sup> I have known that יהוה maintains The cause of the afflicted, The right-ruling of the poor.

<sup>13</sup> Only, let the righteous give thanks to Your Name, Let the straight ones dwell in Your presence.
