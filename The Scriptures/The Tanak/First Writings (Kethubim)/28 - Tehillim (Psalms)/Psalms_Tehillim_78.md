<sup>1</sup> My people, give ear to my Torah, Incline your ears to the words of my mouth.

<sup>2</sup> I open my mouth in a parable; I utter riddles of old,

<sup>3</sup> Which we have heard and known, For our fathers have related them to us.

<sup>4</sup> We do not hide them from their children, Relating to the generation to come the praises of יהוה, And His strength and His wonders which He has done.

<sup>5</sup> For He raised a witness in Ya‛aqoḇ, And set a Torah in Yisra’ĕl, Which He commanded our fathers, To teach them to their children;

<sup>6</sup> That it might be known to a generation to come, To children who would be born, To rise up and relate them to their children,

<sup>7</sup> And place their trust in Elohim, And not forget the works of Ĕl, But watch over His commands,

<sup>8</sup> And not be like their fathers, A stubborn and rebellious generation, A generation which did not prepare its heart, Whose spirit was not steadfast to Ĕl.

<sup>9</sup> The children of Ephrayim, armed bowmen, Turned back in the day of battle.

<sup>10</sup> They did not guard the covenant of Elohim, And they refused to walk in His Torah,

<sup>11</sup> And they forgot His deeds And His wonders which He had shown them.

<sup>12</sup> He did wonders in the sight of their fathers, In the land of Mitsrayim, in the field of Tso‛an.

<sup>13</sup> He split the sea and caused them to pass through, And He made the waters stand up like a heap,

<sup>14</sup> And led them with the cloud by day, And all the night with a light of fire.

<sup>15</sup> He split the rocks in the wilderness, And made them drink, as from the great depths,

<sup>16</sup> And brought forth streams from the rock, And caused waters to come down as rivers.

<sup>17</sup> Yet they sinned still more against Him To rebel against the Most High in the desert.

<sup>18</sup> And they tried Ĕl in their heart By asking food according to their desire.

<sup>19</sup> And they spoke against Elohim. They said, “Is Ĕl able to set a table in the wilderness?

<sup>20</sup> “Look, He struck the rock, So that the waters gushed out, And the streams overflowed. Is He able to give bread also? Would He provide meat for His people?”

<sup>21</sup> Therefore יהוה heard, and He was wroth; So a fire was kindled against Ya‛aqoḇ, And displeasure also came up against Yisra’ĕl,

<sup>22</sup> Because they did not believe in Elohim, Neither did they trust in His deliverance.

<sup>23</sup> Yet He had commanded the clouds above, And opened the doors of the heavens,

<sup>24</sup> And He rained down manna on them to eat, And He gave them the grain of the heavens.

<sup>25</sup> Men ate bread of the mighty; He sent them provisions to satisfaction.

<sup>26</sup> He made an east wind blow in the heavens; And by His power He brought in the south wind.

<sup>27</sup> And He rained meat on them like the dust, And winged birds like the sand of the seas,

<sup>28</sup> And let them fall in the midst of His camp, All around His Dwelling Place.

<sup>29</sup> So they ate and were completely satisfied, For He brought them what they desired.

<sup>30</sup> They had not turned away from their desire, Their food was still in their mouths,

<sup>31</sup> When the wrath of Elohim came against them, And He slew among their fat ones, And He struck down the choice ones of Yisra’ĕl.

<sup>32</sup> In spite of all this they still sinned, And did not believe in His wonders.

<sup>33</sup> So He ended their days in a breath, And their years in trouble.

<sup>34</sup> When He slew them, then they sought Him, And they returned and did earnestly seek Ĕl.

<sup>35</sup> And they remembered that Elohim was their rock, And the Most High Ĕl their redeemer.

<sup>36</sup> But they flattered Him with their mouth, And they lied to Him with their tongue,

<sup>37</sup> For their heart was not steadfast with Him, And they were not true to His covenant.

<sup>38</sup> But He, the Compassionate One, Pardoned crookedness, And did not destroy them. And many a time He turned His displeasure away, And did not stir up all His wrath.

<sup>39</sup> For He remembered that they were but flesh, A passing breath that does not return.

<sup>40</sup> How often they rebelled against Him in the wilderness, And grieved Him in the desert!

<sup>41</sup> And again and again they tried Ĕl, And provoked the Set-apart One of Yisra’ĕl.

<sup>42</sup> They did not remember His hand, The day when He redeemed them from the adversary,

<sup>43</sup> How He worked His signs in Mitsrayim, And His wonders in the field of Tso‛an.

<sup>44</sup> He turned their rivers into blood, And they could not drink their streams.

<sup>45</sup> He sent among them swarms of flies which devoured them, And frogs which destroyed them,

<sup>46</sup> And gave their crops to the caterpillar, And their labour to the locust.

<sup>47</sup> He destroyed their vines with hail, And their sycamore trees with frost,

<sup>48</sup> And gave their beasts over to the hail, And their livestock to bolts of fire.

<sup>49</sup> He sent on them the burning of His displeasure, Wrath, and rage, and distress, A deputation of messengers of evils.

<sup>50</sup> He made a path for His displeasure; He did not spare their being from death, But gave their life over to the plague.

<sup>51</sup> And He smote all the first-born in Mitsrayim, The first-fruits of strength in the tents of Ḥam,

<sup>52</sup> Then made His own people go forth like sheep, And led them in the wilderness like a flock.

<sup>53</sup> And He led them on safely, And they did not fear, But the sea covered their enemies.

<sup>54</sup> And He brought them to the border of His set-apart place, This mountain which His right hand had gained,

<sup>55</sup> And drove out nations before them, And allotted them a measured inheritance, And made the tribes of Yisra’ĕl dwell in their tents.

<sup>56</sup> Yet they tried and rebelled Against the Most High Elohim, And did not guard His witnesses,

<sup>57</sup> But they turned back And acted treacherously like their fathers; They twisted like a treacherous bow.

<sup>58</sup> For they enraged Him with their high places, And moved Him to jealousy with their carved images.

<sup>59</sup> When Elohim heard this, He was wroth, And greatly despised Yisra’ĕl,

<sup>60</sup> And He left the Dwelling Place of Shiloh, The Tent which He had set up among men.

<sup>61</sup> And He gave His strength into captivity, And His comeliness into the hand of the adversary.

<sup>62</sup> And He gave His people over to the sword, And He was wroth with His inheritance.

<sup>63</sup> His young men were consumed by fire, And His maidens were not praised.

<sup>64</sup> His priests fell by the sword, And their widows could not weep.

<sup>65</sup> Then יהוה awoke as one asleep, As a mighty man who shouts because of wine.

<sup>66</sup> And He smote His adversaries backward, He put them to an everlasting reproach.

<sup>67</sup> Then He rejected the tent of Yosĕph, And did not choose the tribe of Ephrayim,

<sup>68</sup> But chose the tribe of Yehuḏah, Mount Tsiyon, which He loved.

<sup>69</sup> And He built His set-apart place like the heights, Like the earth He founded it forever.

<sup>70</sup> And He chose Dawiḏ His servant, And took him from the sheepfolds;

<sup>71</sup> He brought him in from tending the ewes, To shepherd Ya‛aqoḇ His people, And Yisra’ĕl His inheritance.

<sup>72</sup> And he shepherded them According to the integrity of his heart, And led them by the skill of his hands.
