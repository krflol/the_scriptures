<sup>1</sup> Hear my prayer, O יהוה, Give ear to my pleadings In Your trustworthiness. Answer me in Your righteousness.

<sup>2</sup> And do not enter into right-ruling with Your servant, For before You no one living is in the right.

<sup>3</sup> For the enemy has pursued my being; He has crushed my life to the ground; He has made me dwell in dark places, Like the dead of old.

<sup>4</sup> Therefore my spirit grew faint within me, My heart within me is stunned.

<sup>5</sup> I remembered the days of old; I meditated on all Your works; I ponder on the work of Your hands.

<sup>6</sup> I have spread out my hands to You; My being is like a thirsty land for You. Selah.

<sup>7</sup> Hasten, answer me, O יהוה ; My spirit fails! Do not hide Your face from me, Lest I be like those going down into the pit.

<sup>8</sup> Let me hear Your kindness in the morning, For in You I have put my trust; Let me know the way in which I should walk, For I have lifted up my being to You.

<sup>9</sup> Deliver me from my enemies, O יהוה ; I take refuge in You.

<sup>10</sup> Teach me to do Your good pleasure, For You are my Elohim. Let Your good Spirit lead me In the land of straightness.

<sup>11</sup> For the sake of Your Name, O יהוה, revive me! In Your righteousness, Bring my being out of distress.

<sup>12</sup> And in Your kindness, Cut off my enemies. And destroy all the adversaries of my life, For I am Your servant!
