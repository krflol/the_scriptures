<sup>1</sup> O Elohim, save me by Your Name, And rightly rule me by Your might.

<sup>2</sup> Hear my prayer, O Elohim; Give ear to the words of my mouth.

<sup>3</sup> For strangers have risen up against me, And cruel men have sought after my life; They have not set Elohim before them. Selah.

<sup>4</sup> See, Elohim is my helper; יהוה is with those who sustain my life.

<sup>5</sup> He repays evil to my enemies. Cut them off in Your truth.

<sup>6</sup> Voluntarily I slaughter to You; I praise Your Name, O יהוה, for it is good.

<sup>7</sup> For He has delivered me out of all distress; And my eye has looked upon my enemies.
