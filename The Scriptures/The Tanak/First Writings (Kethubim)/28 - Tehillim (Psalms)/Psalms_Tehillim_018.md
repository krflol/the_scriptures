<sup>1</sup> I love You, O יהוה, My strength.

<sup>2</sup> יהוה is my rock and my stronghold and my deliverer; My Ĕl is my rock, I take refuge in Him; My shield and the horn of my deliverance, my high tower.

<sup>3</sup> I call upon יהוה, the One to be praised, And I am saved from my enemies.

<sup>4</sup> The cords of death surrounded me, And the floods of Beliya‛al made me afraid.

<sup>5</sup> The cords of the grave were all around me; The snares of death were before me.

<sup>6</sup> In my distress I called upon יהוה, And to my Elohim I cried; He heard my voice from His Hĕḵal, And my cry went before Him, into His ears.

<sup>7</sup> And the earth shook and trembled; Even the foundations of the mountains were troubled And they shook, because He was wroth.

<sup>8</sup> Smoke went up from His nostrils, And consuming fire from His mouth; Coals were kindled by it.

<sup>9</sup> And He bowed the heavens and came down, And thick darkness was under His feet.

<sup>10</sup> And He rode upon a keruḇ, and flew; He flew upon the wings of the wind.

<sup>11</sup> He made darkness His covering; Around Him His booth, Darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies.

<sup>12</sup> From the brightness before Him, His thick clouds passed, hail and coals of fire.

<sup>13</sup> And יהוה thundered in the heavens, And the Most High sent forth His voice, Hail and coals of fire.

<sup>14</sup> And He sent out His arrows and scattered them, And much lightning, and confused them.

<sup>15</sup> And the channels of waters were seen, And the foundations of the world were uncovered At Your rebuke, O יהוה, At the blast of the breath of Your nostrils.

<sup>16</sup> He sent from above, He took me; He drew me out of many waters.

<sup>17</sup> He delivered me from my strong enemy, And from those hating me, For they were stronger than I.

<sup>18</sup> They confronted me in the day of my calamity, But יהוה was my support.

<sup>19</sup> And He brought me out into a large place; He delivered me for He delighted in me.

<sup>20</sup> יהוה rewarded me according to my righteousness; According to the cleanness of my hands He repaid me.

<sup>21</sup> For I have guarded the ways of יהוה, And have not acted wrongly against my Elohim.

<sup>22</sup> For all His right-rulings are before me, And I did not turn from His laws.

<sup>23</sup> And I am perfect before Him, And I guard myself from my crookedness.

<sup>24</sup> And יהוה repays me according to my righteousness, According to the cleanness of my hands before His eyes.

<sup>25</sup> With the kind You show Yourself kind; With the perfect one You show Yourself perfect;

<sup>26</sup> With the clean You show Yourself clean; And with the crooked You show Yourself twisted.

<sup>27</sup> For You save the afflicted people, But bring down those whose eyes are haughty.

<sup>28</sup> For You Yourself light my lamp; יהוה my Elohim makes my darkness light.

<sup>29</sup> For with You I run against a band, And with my Elohim I leap over a wall.

<sup>30</sup> The Ĕl – His way is perfect; The Word of יהוה is proven; He is a shield to all who take refuge in Him.

<sup>31</sup> For who is Eloah, besides יהוה ? And who is a rock, except our Elohim?

<sup>32</sup> It is Ĕl who girds me with strength, And makes my way perfect,

<sup>33</sup> Making my feet like the feet of deer, And sets me on my high places,

<sup>34</sup> Teaching my hands for battle, So that my arms shall bend a bow of bronze.

<sup>35</sup> And You give me the shield of Your deliverance; And Your right hand supports me, And Your lowliness makes me great.

<sup>36</sup> You enlarge my step under me; And my feet shall not slip.

<sup>37</sup> I pursue my enemies and overtake them; And do not turn back till they are destroyed.

<sup>38</sup> I crush them, and they are unable to rise; They fall under my feet.

<sup>39</sup> And You gird me with strength for battle; Cause my adversaries to bow under me.

<sup>40</sup> And You have made my enemies turn their backs, As for those hating me, I cut them off.

<sup>41</sup> They cry – but no one is there to save, To יהוה – but He answers them not.

<sup>42</sup> And I beat them as dust before the wind; I empty them out like dirt in the streets.

<sup>43</sup> You deliver me from the strivings of the people, You set me at the head of the nations; A people I have not known serve me.

<sup>44</sup> As soon as they hear of me they obey me; The foreigners submit to me.

<sup>45</sup> The foreigners fade away, And come frightened from their strongholds.

<sup>46</sup> יהוה lives! And blessed is my Rock! And exalted is the Elohim of my deliverance,

<sup>47</sup> The Ĕl who avenges me, And He humbles the peoples under me;

<sup>48</sup> My deliverer from my enemies. You lift me up above those who rise against me; You deliver me from a man of violence.

<sup>49</sup> Therefore I give thanks to You, O יהוה, among nations, And I sing praise to Your Name,

<sup>50</sup> Making great the deliverance of His sovereign, And showing kindness to His anointed, To Dawiḏ and his seed, forever.
