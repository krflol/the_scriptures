<sup>1</sup> By the rivers of Baḇel, There we sat down and we wept As we remembered Tsiyon.

<sup>2</sup> We hung our lyres Upon the willows in the midst of it.

<sup>3</sup> For there our captors Asked us for the words of a song, And our plunderers for rejoicing, saying, “Sing to us a song of Tsiyon!”

<sup>4</sup> How could we sing the song of יהוה On foreign soil?

<sup>5</sup> If I forget you, O Yerushalayim, Let my right hand forget.

<sup>6</sup> Let my tongue cleave to my palate, If I do not remember you, If I do not exalt Yerushalayim Above my chief joy.

<sup>7</sup> Remember, O יהוה, against the sons of Eḏom The day of Yerushalayim, Who said, “Lay it bare, lay it bare, To its foundation!”

<sup>8</sup> O daughter of Baḇel, who are to be destroyed, Blessed is he who repays you your deed, What you did to us!

<sup>9</sup> Blessed is he who shall take And dash your little ones against the rock.
