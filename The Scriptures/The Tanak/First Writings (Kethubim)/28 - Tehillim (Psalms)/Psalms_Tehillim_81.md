<sup>1</sup> Shout for joy to Elohim our strength; Raise a shout to the Elohim of Ya‛aqoḇ.

<sup>2</sup> Lift up a song and beat the tambourine, The pleasant lyre and with the harp.

<sup>3</sup> Blow the ram’s horn at the time of the New Moon, At the full moon, on our festival day.

<sup>4</sup> For this is a law for Yisra’ĕl, And a right-ruling of the Elohim of Ya‛aqoḇ.

<sup>5</sup> He appointed it in Yehosĕph for a witness, When He went throughout the land of Mitsrayim; I heard a language that I did not know.

<sup>6</sup> He says, “I removed his shoulder from the burden; His hands were freed from the baskets.

<sup>7</sup> “You called in distress, and I rescued you; I answered you in the covering of thunder; I proved you at the waters of Meriḇah. Selah.

<sup>8</sup> “Hear, O My people, and let Me warn you, O Yisra’ĕl, if you would listen to Me!

<sup>9</sup> “Let there be no strange mighty one among you, And do not bow down to a foreign mighty one.

<sup>10</sup> “I am יהוה your Elohim, Who brought you out of the land of Mitsrayim; Open your mouth wide, and I fill it.

<sup>11</sup> “But My people did not listen to My voice, And Yisra’ĕl would not submit to Me.

<sup>12</sup> “So I gave them over to their own stubborn heart, To walk in their own counsels.

<sup>13</sup> “O, if My people had listened to Me, Yisra’ĕl would walk in My ways,

<sup>14</sup> “I would subdue their enemies at once, And turn My hand against their adversaries!

<sup>15</sup> “Those who hate יהוה would cringe before Him; And their time of punishment be forever.

<sup>16</sup> “He would feed them with the finest of wheat; And with honey from the rock I would satisfy you.”
