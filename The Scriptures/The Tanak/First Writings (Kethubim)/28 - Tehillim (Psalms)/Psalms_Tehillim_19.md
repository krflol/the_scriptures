<sup>1</sup> The heavens are proclaiming the esteem of Ĕl; And the expanse is declaring the work of His hand.

<sup>2</sup> Day to day pours forth speech, And night to night reveals knowledge.

<sup>3</sup> There is no speech, and there are no words, Their voice is not heard.

<sup>4</sup> Their line has gone out through all the earth, And their words to the end of the world. In them He set up a tent for the sun,

<sup>5</sup> And it is like a bridegroom coming out of his room, It rejoices like a strong man to run the path.

<sup>6</sup> Its rising is from one end of the heavens, And its circuit to the other end; And naught is hidden from its heat.

<sup>7</sup> The Torah of יהוה is perfect, bringing back the being; The witness of יהוה is trustworthy, making wise the simple;

<sup>8</sup> The orders of יהוה are straight, rejoicing the heart; The command of יהוה is clear, enlightening the eyes;

<sup>9</sup> The fear of יהוה is clean, standing forever; The right-rulings of יהוה are true, They are righteous altogether,

<sup>10</sup> More desirable than gold, Than much fine gold; And sweeter than honey and the honeycomb.

<sup>11</sup> Also, Your servant is warned by them, In guarding them there is great reward.

<sup>12</sup> Who discerns mistakes? Declare me innocent from those that are secret,

<sup>13</sup> Also keep Your servant back from presumptuous ones, Do not let them rule over me. Then shall I be perfect, and innocent of great transgression.

<sup>14</sup> Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart Be pleasing before You, O יהוה, my rock and my redeemer.
