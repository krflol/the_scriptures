<sup>1</sup> Save, יהוה, for the kind one is no more! For the trustworthy have ceased from among the sons of men.

<sup>2</sup> They speak falsehood with each other; They speak with flattering lips, a double heart.

<sup>3</sup> יהוה does cut off all flattering lips, A tongue that speaks swelling words,

<sup>4</sup> Who have said, “With our tongue we do mightily; Our lips are our own; Who is master over us?”

<sup>5</sup> “Because of the oppression of the poor, because of the sighing of the needy, I now arise,” says יהוה, “I set in safety – he pants for it.”

<sup>6</sup> The Words of יהוה are clean Words, Silver tried in a furnace of earth, Refined seven times.

<sup>7</sup> You guard them, O יהוה, You preserve them from this generation forever.

<sup>8</sup> The wrong walk around on every side, When worthlessness is exalted among the sons of men.
