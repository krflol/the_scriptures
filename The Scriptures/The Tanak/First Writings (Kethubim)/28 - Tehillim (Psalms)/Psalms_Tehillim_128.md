<sup>1</sup> Blessed are all who fear יהוה, Who walk in His ways.

<sup>2</sup> You shall eat the labour of your hands. Be blessed, and let it be well with you.

<sup>3</sup> Let your wife be As a fruit-bearing vine within your house, Your sons like olive plants all around your table.

<sup>4</sup> Look, so shall the man be blessed Who fears יהוה.

<sup>5</sup> יהוה shall bless you out of Tsiyon, And let you see the good of Yerushalayim All the days of your life,

<sup>6</sup> And let you see your children’s children! Peace be upon Yisra’ĕl!
