<sup>1</sup> Not to us, O יהוה, not to us, But to Your Name give esteem, For Your kindness, For Your truth.

<sup>2</sup> Why should the gentiles say, “Where now is their Elohim?”

<sup>3</sup> But our Elohim is in the heavens; Whatever pleased Him, He has done.

<sup>4</sup> Their idols are silver and gold, The work of men’s hands.

<sup>5</sup> They have mouths, but they do not speak; They have eyes, but they do not see;

<sup>6</sup> They have ears, but they do not hear; They have noses, but they do not smell;

<sup>7</sup> They have hands, but they do not handle; They have feet, but they do not walk; They make no sound through their throat.

<sup>8</sup> The ones who make them, shall become like them – All who trust in them.

<sup>9</sup> O Yisra’ĕl, trust in יהוה ; He is their help and their shield.

<sup>10</sup> O house of Aharon, trust in יהוה ; He is their help and their shield.

<sup>11</sup> You who fear יהוה, trust in יהוה ; He is their help and their shield.

<sup>12</sup> יהוה has remembered us; He blesses us; He blesses the house of Yisra’ĕl; He blesses the house of Aharon.

<sup>13</sup> He blesses those who fear יהוה, The small and the great.

<sup>14</sup> יהוה give you increase more and more, You and your children.

<sup>15</sup> You are blessed by יהוה, Who made the heavens and earth.

<sup>16</sup> The heavens are the heavens of יהוה ; But He has given the earth to the children of men.

<sup>17</sup> The dead do not praise Yah, Nor any going down to silence.

<sup>18</sup> But we, we bless Yah Now and forever. Praise Yah!
