<sup>1</sup> Would you indeed speak righteousness, in silence? Do you judge straightly, you sons of men?

<sup>2</sup> No, in heart you work unrighteousness; On earth you weigh out the violence of your hands.

<sup>3</sup> The wrong have been estranged from the womb; These who speak lies go astray from birth.

<sup>4</sup> Their poison is like the poison of a snake; Like a deaf cobra that stops its ear,

<sup>5</sup> So as not to hear the voice of whisperers, Or a skilled caster of spells.

<sup>6</sup> O Elohim, break their teeth in their mouth! Break out the fangs of the young lions, O יהוה !

<sup>7</sup> Let them melt, let them vanish as water; Let Him aim His arrows that they be cut down;

<sup>8</sup> Like a snail which melts away as it moves, Like a woman’s stillbirth, Let them not see the sun!

<sup>9</sup> Before your pots feel the thorns, Whether green or ablaze, He sweeps them away.

<sup>10</sup> The righteous rejoices when he has seen the vengeance, He washes his feet in the blood of the wrong,

<sup>11</sup> And man says, “Truly, the righteous are rewarded; Truly, there is an Elohim judging in the earth.”
