<sup>1</sup> We shall give thanks to You, O Elohim, we shall give thanks! And Your Name is near! Your wonders shall be declared!

<sup>2</sup> “When I seize the appointed time, It is I who judge in uprightness.

<sup>3</sup> “The earth and all its inhabitants are melted; It is I who set its columns firm. Selah.

<sup>4</sup> “I said to the boasters, ‘Do not boast,’ And to the wrong, ‘Do not lift up the horn.

<sup>5</sup> “Do not lift up your horn on high (You speak with a stiff neck).’ ”

<sup>6</sup> For exaltations are neither from the east, Nor from the west nor from the wilderness.

<sup>7</sup> But Elohim is the Judge – He puts down one, And exalts another.

<sup>8</sup> For a cup is in the hand of יהוה, And the wine shall foam; It is filled with a mixture, And He pours it out. All the wrong of the earth drink, Draining it to the dregs.

<sup>9</sup> But I, I declare forever, I sing praises to the Elohim of Ya‛aqoḇ.

<sup>10</sup> “And all the horns of the wrong I cut off; The horns of the righteous are lifted up.”
