<sup>1</sup> O Elohim, do not remain silent! Do not be speechless, And do not be still, O Ĕl!

<sup>2</sup> For look, Your enemies make an uproar, And those hating You have lifted up their head.

<sup>3</sup> They craftily plot against Your people, And conspire against Your treasured ones.

<sup>4</sup> They have said, “Come, And let us wipe them out as a nation, And let the name of Yisra’ĕl be remembered no more.”

<sup>5</sup> For they have conspired together with one heart; They have made a covenant against You –

<sup>6</sup> The tents of Eḏom and the Yishma‛ĕlites, Mo’aḇ and the Haḡarites,

<sup>7</sup> Geḇal, and Ammon, and Amalĕq, Philistia with the inhabitants of Tsor,

<sup>8</sup> Ashshur also has joined with them, They have helped the children of Lot. Selah.

<sup>9</sup> Do to them as to Miḏyan, As to Sisera, As to Yaḇin at the wadi Qishon,

<sup>10</sup> Who perished at Ĕndor, Who became as dung for the ground.

<sup>11</sup> Make their nobles like Orĕḇ and like Ze’ĕḇ, And all their princes like Zeḇaḥ and Tsalmunna,

<sup>12</sup> Who have said, “Let us take possession of the pastures of Elohim For ourselves.”

<sup>13</sup> O my Elohim, make them as whirling dust, As stubble before the wind!

<sup>14</sup> As a fire consumes a forest, And as a flame sets mountains on fire,

<sup>15</sup> So pursue them with Your whirlwind, And frighten them with Your storm.

<sup>16</sup> Fill their faces with shame, And let them seek Your Name, O יהוה.

<sup>17</sup> Let them be ashamed and alarmed forever; And let them become abashed and perish,

<sup>18</sup> And let them know that You, Whose Name is יהוה, You alone are the Most High over all the earth.
