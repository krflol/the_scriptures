<sup>1</sup> I give You thanks with all my heart; Before the mighty ones I sing praises to You.

<sup>2</sup> I bow myself toward Your set-apart Hĕḵal, And give thanks to Your Name For Your kindness and for Your truth; For You have made great Your Word, Your Name, above all.

<sup>3</sup> On the day I called You did answer me, You made me bold with strength in my being.

<sup>4</sup> Let all the sovereigns of the earth Give thanks to You, O יהוה, When they shall hear the words of Your mouth.

<sup>5</sup> And let them sing of the ways of יהוה, For great is the esteem of יהוה.

<sup>6</sup> Though יהוה is exalted, He looks on the humble; But the proud He perceives from a distance.

<sup>7</sup> Though I walk in the midst of distress, You revive me; You stretch out Your hand Against the wrath of my enemies, And Your right hand saves me.

<sup>8</sup> יהוה does perfect for me. O יהוה, Your kindness is everlasting. Do not forsake the works of Your hands.
