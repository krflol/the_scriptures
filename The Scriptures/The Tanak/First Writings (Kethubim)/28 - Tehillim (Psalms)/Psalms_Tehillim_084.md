<sup>1</sup> How lovely are Your dwelling places, O יהוה of hosts!

<sup>2</sup> My being has longed, and even fainted, For the courts of יהוה ; My heart and my flesh cry out for the living Ĕl.

<sup>3</sup> Even the sparrow has found a home, And the swallow a nest for herself, Where she has put her young ones – Your altars, O יהוה of hosts, My Sovereign and my Elohim.

<sup>4</sup> Blessed are those who dwell in Your house, They are ever praising You. Selah.

<sup>5</sup> Blessed is the man whose strength is in You, Your Highways are in their heart.

<sup>6</sup> Passing through the valley of weeping, They make it a fountain; The Teacher also covers it with blessings.

<sup>7</sup> They go from strength to strength, Appearing before Elohim in Tsiyon.

<sup>8</sup> O יהוה Elohim of hosts, hear my prayer; Give ear, O Elohim of Ya‛aqoḇ! Selah.

<sup>9</sup> O Elohim, see our shield, And look upon the face of Your anointed.

<sup>10</sup> For a day in Your courts Is better than a thousand days. I have chosen rather to be a doorkeeper In the House of my Elohim, Than to dwell in the tents of the wrong.

<sup>11</sup> For יהוה Elohim is a sun and a shield; יהוה gives favour and esteem; He withholds no good matter From those who walk blamelessly.

<sup>12</sup> O יהוה of hosts, Blessed is the man who trusts in You!
