<sup>1</sup> Hear this, all you peoples; Give ear, all you inhabitants of the world,

<sup>2</sup> Both sons of mankind and sons of man, Rich and poor together.

<sup>3</sup> My mouth speaks wisdom, And the meditation of my heart brings understanding.

<sup>4</sup> I incline my ear to a parable; I expound my riddle on the lyre.

<sup>5</sup> Why should I fear in the days of evil, When the crookedness of my supplanters surrounds me?

<sup>6</sup> Those who are trusting in their riches And who are boasting in their great wealth?

<sup>7</sup> A brother does not redeem anyone at all, Neither give to Elohim a ransom for him;

<sup>8</sup> For the redemption of their lives is costly, And it shall cease forever;

<sup>9</sup> That he should still live forever, And not see the Pit.

<sup>10</sup> For he sees wise men die, The foolish and the ignorant both perish, And shall leave their wealth to others.

<sup>11</sup> Their graves are their houses, forever; Their dwelling places, to all generations; They call their lands after their own names.

<sup>12</sup> But man does not remain in esteem, He is like the beasts that perish.

<sup>13</sup> This way of theirs is folly to them, Yet their followers are pleased with their words. Selah.

<sup>14</sup> Like sheep they shall be laid in the grave; Death shall shepherd them; And the upright rule over them in the morning; And their form is consumed in the grave, Far from their dwelling.

<sup>15</sup> But Elohim does redeem my being From the power of the grave, For He does receive me. Selah.

<sup>16</sup> Do not be afraid when a man becomes rich, When the wealth of his house increases;

<sup>17</sup> For when he dies he takes none of it; His wealth does not go down after him.

<sup>18</sup> Though while he lived he blessed himself, And though they praise you when you do well for yourself,

<sup>19</sup> He has to go to the generation of his fathers; They never see the light.

<sup>20</sup> Man, who is rich, Yet does not understand, Shall be like the beasts, They shall perish.
