<sup>1</sup> יהוה, I have cried out to You; Hasten to me! Give ear to my voice when I cry out to You.

<sup>2</sup> Let my prayer be prepared before You as incense, The lifting up of my hands as the evening offering.

<sup>3</sup> O יהוה, set a guard for my mouth; Watch over the door of my lips.

<sup>4</sup> Let not my heart be inclined to evil, To practise deeds of wrongness With men working wickedness, And let me not eat of their delicacies.

<sup>5</sup> Let the righteous one smite me Or reprove me in kindness – It is oil on my head. Let my head not refuse it. My prayer is still against their evil deeds.

<sup>6</sup> Their judges have been thrown down By the sides of the rock, But they have heard my words, For they have been pleasant.

<sup>7</sup> Our bones are scattered at the mouth of the grave, As when one ploughs and breaks up the earth.

<sup>8</sup> But my eyes are upon You, O Master יהוה. In You I take refuge; Do not pour out my life.

<sup>9</sup> Guard me from the clutches Of the trap they have laid for me, And from the snares Of the workers of wickedness.

<sup>10</sup> Let the wrong fall into their own nets, While I pass by.
