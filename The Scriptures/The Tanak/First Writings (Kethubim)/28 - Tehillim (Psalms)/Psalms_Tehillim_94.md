<sup>1</sup> O יהוה, Ĕl of vengeance; O Ĕl of vengeance, shine forth!

<sup>2</sup> Raise Yourself up, O Judge of the earth; Render punishment to the proud.

<sup>3</sup> יהוה, how long are the wrong, How long are the wrong going to exult?

<sup>4</sup> They pour forth words, They speak arrogantly; All the workers of wickedness boast in themselves.

<sup>5</sup> They crush Your people, O יהוה, And they afflict Your inheritance.

<sup>6</sup> They slay the widow and the stranger, And murder the fatherless.

<sup>7</sup> Yet they say, “Yah does not see, And the Elohim of Ya‛aqoḇ pays no heed.”

<sup>8</sup> Take heed, you senseless among the people; And you fools, when would you become wise?

<sup>9</sup> He who planted the ear, does He not hear? He who formed the eye, does He not see?

<sup>10</sup> He who disciplines the nations, Does He not reprove – The One teaching man knowledge?

<sup>11</sup> יהוה knows the thoughts of man, That they are but a breath.

<sup>12</sup> Blessed is the man You discipline, O Yah, And instruct out of Your Torah,

<sup>13</sup> To give him rest from the days of evil, Until the pit is dug for the wrong.

<sup>14</sup> For יהוה does not leave His people, Nor does He forsake His inheritance.

<sup>15</sup> For right-ruling returns man to righteousness, And all the upright in heart follow it.

<sup>16</sup> Who would rise up for me against evil-doers? Who would stand up for me against workers of wickedness?

<sup>17</sup> If יהוה had not been my help, My being would soon have settled in silence.

<sup>18</sup> When I said, “My foot has slipped,” Your kindness, O יהוה, supported me.

<sup>19</sup> When anxiety was great within me, Your comforts delighted my being.

<sup>20</sup> Would a throne of destruction, Which devises trouble by decree, Be joined with You?

<sup>21</sup> They band together against the life of the righteous, And declare innocent blood wrong.

<sup>22</sup> But יהוה is my defence, And my Elohim the rock of my refuge,

<sup>23</sup> And brings back on them their own wickedness, And cuts them off in their own wrongdoing; יהוה our Elohim does cut them off.
