<sup>1</sup> If יהוה does not build the house, Its builders have laboured in vain. If יהוה does not guard the city, The watchman has stayed awake in vain.

<sup>2</sup> In vain do you rise up early, To sit up late, to eat the bread of toil; So He gives His beloved sleep.

<sup>3</sup> Look, children are an inheritance from יהוה, The fruit of the womb is the reward.

<sup>4</sup> As arrows in the hand of a mighty man, So are the children of one’s youth.

<sup>5</sup> Blessed is the man Who has filled his quiver with them. They are not ashamed, When they speak with their enemies in the gate.
