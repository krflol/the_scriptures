<sup>1</sup> In You, O יהוה, I have taken refuge; Let me never be ashamed.

<sup>2</sup> In Your righteousness deliver and rescue me; Incline Your ear to me, and save me.

<sup>3</sup> Be to me a rock to dwell in, To go into continually. You have given the command to save me, For You are my rock and my stronghold.

<sup>4</sup> Rescue me, O my Elohim, Out of the hand of the wrong, Out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel.

<sup>5</sup> For You are my expectation, Master יהוה, my Trust from my youth.

<sup>6</sup> Upon You I have leaned from my birth; You took me out of my mother’s womb. My praise is continually of You.

<sup>7</sup> I have become as a wonder to many, But You are my strong refuge.

<sup>8</sup> My mouth is filled with Your praise, Your splendour, all the day.

<sup>9</sup> Do not cast me off in the time of old age, When my strength fails, do not forsake me.

<sup>10</sup> For my enemies have spoken against me. And those who watch for my life Have taken counsel together,

<sup>11</sup> Saying, “Elohim has forsaken him; Pursue and take him, for there is no one to deliver.”

<sup>12</sup> O Elohim, do not be far from me; My Elohim, hasten to my help!

<sup>13</sup> Let those who are adversaries of my life Be ashamed, consumed, Let those who seek my evil Be covered with reproach and confusion.

<sup>14</sup> But I continually wait, And shall praise You more and more.

<sup>15</sup> My mouth recounts Your righteousness Your deliverance all the day, Though I do not know their numbers.

<sup>16</sup> I come in the might of the Master יהוה ; I make mention of Your righteousness, Yours alone.

<sup>17</sup> Elohim, You have taught me from my youth; And to this day I declare Your wonders.

<sup>18</sup> And also when I am old and grey, O Elohim, do not forsake me, Until I declare Your strength to a generation, Your might to all those who are to come.

<sup>19</sup> For Your righteousness, O Elohim, is most high, You who have done great deeds. O Elohim, who is like You?

<sup>20</sup> You who have shown me great and evil distresses, Revive me again and bring me up again From the depths of the earth.

<sup>21</sup> You increase my greatness, And comfort me on every side.

<sup>22</sup> Also with the lyre I praise You For Your trustworthiness, O my Elohim! I sing to You with the lyre, O Set-apart One of Yisra’ĕl.

<sup>23</sup> My lips shout for joy when I sing to You, Even my being, which You have redeemed.

<sup>24</sup> My tongue, too, utters Your righteousness all day long; For those who have been seeking my evil Have been put to shame, Have become abashed.

<sup>1</sup> In You, O יהוה, I have taken refuge; Let me never be ashamed.

<sup>2</sup> In Your righteousness deliver and rescue me; Incline Your ear to me, and save me.

<sup>3</sup> Be to me a rock to dwell in, To go into continually. You have given the command to save me, For You are my rock and my stronghold.
