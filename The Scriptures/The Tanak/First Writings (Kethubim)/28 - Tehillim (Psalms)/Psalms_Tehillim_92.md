<sup>1</sup> It is good to give thanks to יהוה, And to sing praises to Your Name, O Most High;

<sup>2</sup> To declare Your kindness in the morning, And Your trustworthiness each night,

<sup>3</sup> On ten strings, and on the harp, To the sounding chords of the lyre.

<sup>4</sup> For You have made me rejoice with Your work, O יהוה, I shout for joy at the works of Your hands.

<sup>5</sup> O יהוה, how great are Your works! Your thoughts are very deep!

<sup>6</sup> A senseless man does not know, And a fool does not understand this.

<sup>7</sup> When the wrong spring up like grass, And all the workers of wickedness blossom, It is for them to be destroyed forever.

<sup>8</sup> But You, יהוה, are on high forever.

<sup>9</sup> For look, Your enemies, O יהוה, For look, Your enemies do perish; All the workers of wickedness are scattered.

<sup>10</sup> But You lift up my horn like a wild ox; I have been anointed with fresh oil.

<sup>11</sup> And my eye looks upon my enemies; My ears hear the evil-doers Who rise up against me.

<sup>12</sup> The righteous one flourishes like a palm tree, He grows like a cedar in Leḇanon.

<sup>13</sup> Those who are planted in the House of יהוה Flourish in the courts of our Elohim.

<sup>14</sup> They still bear fruit in old age; They are fresh and green,

<sup>15</sup> To declare that יהוה is straight, My rock, and in Him is no unrighteousness.
