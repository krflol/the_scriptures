<sup>1</sup> My being finds rest in Elohim alone; From Him is my deliverance.

<sup>2</sup> He alone is my rock and my deliverance, my strong tower; I am not greatly shaken.

<sup>3</sup> How long would you assail a man? You crush him, all of you, Like a leaning wall, a tottering fence.

<sup>4</sup> They plotted to topple him from his high position; They delight in lies; They bless with their mouth, But in their heart they curse. Selah.

<sup>5</sup> My being, find rest in Elohim alone, Because my expectation is from Him.

<sup>6</sup> He alone is my rock and my deliverance, my strong tower; I am not shaken.

<sup>7</sup> My deliverance and my esteem depend on Elohim; The rock of my strength, my refuge is in Elohim.

<sup>8</sup> Trust in Him at all times, you people; Pour out your heart before Him; Elohim is a refuge for us. Selah.

<sup>9</sup> Sons of Aḏam are but a breath, Sons of men are a lie; If weighed in the scales, They are altogether lighter than breath.

<sup>10</sup> Do not trust in oppression. And do not become vain in robbery; If riches increase, Do not set your heart on them.

<sup>11</sup> Elohim has spoken once, Twice I have heard this: That strength belongs to Elohim.

<sup>12</sup> And kindness is Yours, O יהוה ; For You reward each one according to his work.
