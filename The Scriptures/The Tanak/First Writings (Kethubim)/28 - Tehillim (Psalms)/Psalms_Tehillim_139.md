<sup>1</sup> O יהוה, You have searched me And know me.

<sup>2</sup> You know my sitting down and my rising up; You understand my thought from afar.

<sup>3</sup> You sift my path and my lying down, And know well all my ways.

<sup>4</sup> For there is not a word on my tongue, But see, O יהוה, You know it all!

<sup>5</sup> You have closed me in, behind and before, And laid Your hand upon me –

<sup>6</sup> Knowledge too wondrous for me, It is high, I am unable to reach it.

<sup>7</sup> Where would I go from Your Spirit? Or where would I flee from Your face?

<sup>8</sup> If I go up into the heavens, You are there; If I make my bed in the grave, see, You are there.

<sup>9</sup> I take the wings of the morning, I dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea,

<sup>10</sup> There, too, Your hand would lead me, And Your right hand hold me.

<sup>11</sup> If I say, “Darkness shall cover me,” Then night would be light to me;

<sup>12</sup> Even darkness is not dark for You, But night shines as the day – As is darkness, so is light.

<sup>13</sup> For You, You possessed my kidneys, You have covered me in my mother’s womb.

<sup>14</sup> I give thanks to You, For I am awesomely and wondrously made! Wondrous are Your works, And my being knows it well.

<sup>15</sup> My bones was not concealed from You, When I was shaped in a hidden place, Knit together in the depths of the earth.

<sup>16</sup> Your eyes saw my unformed body. And in Your book all of them were written, The days they were formed, While none was among them.

<sup>17</sup> And how precious are Your thoughts to me, O Ĕl! How great has been the sum of them!

<sup>18</sup> If I should count them, They would be more than the sand; When I wake up, I am still with You.

<sup>19</sup> Oh, that You would slay the wrong, O Eloah! Depart from me, therefore, men of bloodshed!

<sup>20</sup> They speak against You wickedly. Bring Your enemies to naught!

<sup>21</sup> O יהוה, do I not hate them, who hate You? And do I not loathe those who rise up against You?

<sup>22</sup> With a complete hatred I hate them; They have become my enemies.

<sup>23</sup> Search me, O Ĕl, and know my heart; Try me, and know my thoughts;

<sup>24</sup> And see if an idolatrous way is in me, And lead me in the way everlasting.
