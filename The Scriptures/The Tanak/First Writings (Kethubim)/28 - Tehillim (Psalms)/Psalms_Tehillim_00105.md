<sup>1</sup> Give thanks to יהוה ! Call upon His Name, Make known His deeds among the peoples.

<sup>2</sup> Sing to Him, sing praise to Him; Speak of all His wonders.

<sup>3</sup> Make your boast in His set-apart Name; Let the hearts rejoice of those seeking יהוה.

<sup>4</sup> Seek יהוה and His strength; Seek His face always.

<sup>5</sup> Remember His wonders which He has done, His miracles, and the right-rulings of His mouth,

<sup>6</sup> O seed of Aḇraham His servant, Children of Ya‛aqoḇ, His chosen ones!

<sup>7</sup> He is יהוה our Elohim; His right-rulings are in all the earth.

<sup>8</sup> He has remembered His covenant forever, The Word He commanded, for a thousand generations,

<sup>9</sup> The covenant He made with Aḇraham, And His oath to Yitsḥaq,

<sup>10</sup> And established it to Ya‛aqoḇ for a law, To Yisra’ĕl – an everlasting covenant,

<sup>11</sup> Saying, “To you I give the land of Kena‛an, The portion of your inheritance.”

<sup>12</sup> When they were few in number, Few indeed, and sojourners in it,

<sup>13</sup> And they went about from one nation to another, From one reign to another people,

<sup>14</sup> He allowed no one to oppress them, And He reproved sovereigns for their sakes,

<sup>15</sup> Saying, “Do not touch My anointed ones, And do My prophets no evil.”

<sup>16</sup> And He called for a scarcity of food in the land; He cut off all the supply of bread.

<sup>17</sup> He sent ahead of them a man, Yosĕph, sold as a slave.

<sup>18</sup> They afflicted his feet with shackles, His neck was put in irons.

<sup>19</sup> Until the time that His Word came, The Word of יהוה tried him.

<sup>20</sup> The sovereign sent and released him, The ruler of the people let him loose.

<sup>21</sup> He made him master of his house, And ruler over all his possessions,

<sup>22</sup> To bind his chiefs at his pleasure, And to teach his elders wisdom.

<sup>23</sup> Then Yisra’ĕl came to Mitsrayim, And Ya‛aqoḇ sojourned in the land of Ḥam.

<sup>24</sup> And He increased His people greatly, And made them stronger than their enemies.

<sup>25</sup> He turned their heart to hate His people, To conspire against His servants.

<sup>26</sup> He sent Mosheh His servant, Aharon whom He had chosen.

<sup>27</sup> They set among them the matters of His signs, And wonders in the land of Ḥam.

<sup>28</sup> He sent darkness, and made it dark; And they did not rebel against His word.

<sup>29</sup> He turned their waters into blood, And killed their fish.

<sup>30</sup> Their land teemed with frogs, In the rooms of their sovereigns.

<sup>31</sup> He spoke, and swarms of flies came, Gnats in all their borders.

<sup>32</sup> He gave them hail for rain, A flaming fire in their land.

<sup>33</sup> And He smote their vines and their fig trees, And broke the trees of their borders.

<sup>34</sup> He spoke, and locusts came, And larvae, innumerable,

<sup>35</sup> And they devoured all the plants in their land, And they devoured the fruit of their ground.

<sup>36</sup> Then He smote all the first-born in their land, The first-fruit of all their strength,

<sup>37</sup> And brought them out with silver and gold, And among His tribes no one faltered.

<sup>38</sup> Mitsrayim was glad when they left, For the fear of them had fallen upon them.

<sup>39</sup> He spread a cloud for a covering, And fire to give light in the night.

<sup>40</sup> They asked, and He brought quail, And satisfied them with the bread of heaven.

<sup>41</sup> He opened the rock, and water gushed out; It ran in the dry places, a river.

<sup>42</sup> For He remembered His set-apart word, To Aḇraham His servant.

<sup>43</sup> So He brought out His people with joy, His chosen ones with singing.

<sup>44</sup> And He gave to them the lands of the gentiles, And they inherited the labour of peoples,

<sup>45</sup> In order that they might guard His laws, And watch over His Torot. Praise Yah!
