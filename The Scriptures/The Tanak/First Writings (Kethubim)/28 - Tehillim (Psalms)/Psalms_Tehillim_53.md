<sup>1</sup> The fool has said in his heart, “There is no Elohim.” They have done corruptly, And they have done abominable unrighteousness; No one does good.

<sup>2</sup> Elohim looked down from the heavens on the children of men, To see if there is a wise one, seeking Elohim.

<sup>3</sup> They have all turned aside; They have together become filthy; No one is doing good, not even one.

<sup>4</sup> Have the workers of wickedness no knowledge, Who eat up my people as they eat bread, And do not call on Elohim?

<sup>5</sup> There they are in great fear, Where no fear was, For Elohim shall scatter the bones Of him who encamps against you. You shall put them to shame, For Elohim has rejected them.

<sup>6</sup> O that the deliverance of Yisra’ĕl Would be given out of Tsiyon! When Elohim turns back the captivity of His people, Let Ya‛aqoḇ rejoice, let Yisra’ĕl be glad.
