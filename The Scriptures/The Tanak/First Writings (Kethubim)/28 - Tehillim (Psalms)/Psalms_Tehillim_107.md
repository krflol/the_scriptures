<sup>1</sup> Give thanks to יהוה ! For He is good, For His kindness is everlasting.

<sup>2</sup> Let the redeemed of יהוה say so, Whom He has redeemed from the hand of the adversary,

<sup>3</sup> And gathered out of the lands, From east and from west, From north and from south.

<sup>4</sup> They wandered in a wilderness, in a desert way; They found no city to dwell in.

<sup>5</sup> Hungry and thirsty, Their being in them grew faint.

<sup>6</sup> Then they cried out to יהוה in their distress, He delivered them out of their troubles.

<sup>7</sup> And He guided them by the right way, To go to a city to settle.

<sup>8</sup> Let them give thanks to יהוה for His kindness, And His wonders to the children of men!

<sup>9</sup> For He has satisfied a longing being, And has filled the hungry being with goodness.

<sup>10</sup> Some sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, Bound in affliction and irons,

<sup>11</sup> Because they rebelled against the words of Ĕl, And despised the counsel of the Most High.

<sup>12</sup> And He humbled their heart by toil; They stumbled, and there was no one to help.

<sup>13</sup> And they cried out to יהוה in their distress, And He saved them out of their troubles.

<sup>14</sup> He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, And He broke their chains in pieces.

<sup>15</sup> Let them give thanks to יהוה for His kindness, And His wonders to the children of men!

<sup>16</sup> For He has broken the gates of bronze, And He cut the bars of iron in two.

<sup>17</sup> Fools, because of their transgression, And because of their crookednesses, were afflicted.

<sup>18</sup> Their being loathed all food, And they drew near to the gates of death,

<sup>19</sup> And cried out to יהוה in their distress, He saved them out of their troubles.

<sup>20</sup> He sent His word and healed them, And delivered them from their destructions.

<sup>21</sup> Let them give thanks to יהוה for His kindness, And His wonders to the children of men!

<sup>22</sup> And let them bring slaughterings of thanksgiving, And relate His works with rejoicing.

<sup>23</sup> Those who go down to the sea in ships, Doing work in many waters,

<sup>24</sup> They see the works of יהוה, And His wonders in the deep.

<sup>25</sup> For He commands and raises the stormy wind, Which lifts up the waves of the sea.

<sup>26</sup> They go up to the heavens, They go down to the depths; Their being is melted because of evil.

<sup>27</sup> They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunkard, And all their wisdom is swallowed up.

<sup>28</sup> Then they cry out to יהוה in their distress, And He brings them out of their troubles.

<sup>29</sup> He caused the storm to be still, So that its waves were silent.

<sup>30</sup> And they rejoice because they are hushed; And He leads them to the haven of their delight.

<sup>31</sup> Let them give thanks to יהוה for His kindness, And His wonders to the children of men!

<sup>32</sup> And let them exalt Him in the assembly of the people, And praise Him in the seat of the elders.

<sup>33</sup> He makes rivers become a wilderness, And the fountains of water become a dry ground;

<sup>34</sup> A land of fruit becomes a salty desert, For the evil of those who dwell in it.

<sup>35</sup> He makes a wilderness become a pool of water, And dry land become fountains of waters.

<sup>36</sup> And He causes the hungry to dwell there, And they build a city to settle in,

<sup>37</sup> And they sow fields and plant vineyards, And they make fruits of increase.

<sup>38</sup> And He blesses them, And they increase greatly; And He lets not their cattle diminish.

<sup>39</sup> But when they are diminished and brought low Through oppression, evil and sorrow,

<sup>40</sup> He pours scorn on nobles, And causes them to wander in a pathless waste;

<sup>41</sup> But He raises the poor up from affliction, And makes their clans like a flock.

<sup>42</sup> The straight ones see, and rejoice, And all unrighteousness shuts its mouth.

<sup>43</sup> Who is wise? Then let him observe these matters! Let them understand the kindnesses of יהוה.
