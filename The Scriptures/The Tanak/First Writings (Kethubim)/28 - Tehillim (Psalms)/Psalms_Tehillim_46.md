<sup>1</sup> Elohim is our refuge and strength, A help in distress, soon found.

<sup>2</sup> Therefore we do not fear, Though the earth reels And mountains topple into the heart of the seas.

<sup>3</sup> Let its waters rage, foam; Let mountains shake with its swelling. Selah.

<sup>4</sup> A river whose streams Make glad the city of Elohim, The set-apart dwelling of the Most High.

<sup>5</sup> Elohim is in her midst, she does not topple; Elohim does help her when morning turns.

<sup>6</sup> The gentiles shall rage, Reigns shall topple; He shall give forth His voice, The earth melts.

<sup>7</sup> יהוה of hosts is with us; The Elohim of Ya‛aqoḇ is our refuge. Selah.

<sup>8</sup> Come, see the works of יהוה, The ruins He has wrought on the earth,

<sup>9</sup> Causing all fighting to cease, Unto the end of the earth. He breaks the bow and shatters the spear; He burns the chariot with fire.

<sup>10</sup> Be still, and know that I am Elohim; I am exalted among nations, I am exalted in the earth!

<sup>11</sup> יהוה of hosts is with us; The Elohim of Ya‛aqoḇ is our refuge. Selah.
