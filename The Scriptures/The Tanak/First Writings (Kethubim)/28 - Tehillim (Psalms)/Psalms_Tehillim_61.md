<sup>1</sup> Hear my cry, O Elohim, Listen to my prayer.

<sup>2</sup> From the end of the earth I call unto You, When my heart is faint; Lead me to the rock that is higher than I.

<sup>3</sup> For You have been my refuge, A strong tower in the face of the enemy.

<sup>4</sup> Let me dwell in Your Tent forever, Let me take refuge in the shelter of Your wings. Selah.

<sup>5</sup> For You, O Elohim, have heard my vows; You have given me the inheritance Of those who fear Your Name.

<sup>6</sup> You add days to the days of the sovereign, His years as many generations.

<sup>7</sup> Let him dwell forever before Elohim. Prepare kindness and truth to preserve him!

<sup>8</sup> So I sing praise to Your Name forever, When I pay my vows day by day.
