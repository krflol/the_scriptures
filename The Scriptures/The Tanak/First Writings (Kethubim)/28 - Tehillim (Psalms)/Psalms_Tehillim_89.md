<sup>1</sup> I sing of the kindnesses of יהוה forever; With my mouth I make known Your trustworthiness To all generations.

<sup>2</sup> For I said, “Kindness is built up forever; You establish Your trustworthiness in the heavens.”

<sup>3</sup> You said, “I have made a covenant with My chosen, I have sworn to My servant Dawiḏ:

<sup>4</sup> ‘I establish your seed forever, And shall build up your throne to all generations.’ ” Selah.

<sup>5</sup> And the heavens praise Your wonders, O יהוה, Your trustworthiness, too, In the assembly of the set-apart ones.

<sup>6</sup> For who in the heavens is comparable to יהוה ? Who among the sons of the mighty is like יהוה ?

<sup>7</sup> Ĕl is greatly feared In the company of the set-apart ones, And awesome above all those around Him.

<sup>8</sup> O יהוה Elohim of hosts, Who is mighty like You, O Yah? And Your trustworthiness is all around You.

<sup>9</sup> You rule the swelling of the sea; When its waves rise, You still them.

<sup>10</sup> You have broken Rahaḇ in pieces, as one who is slain; You have scattered Your enemies With the arm of Your strength.

<sup>11</sup> The heavens are Yours, The earth also is Yours; The world and all that fills it. You have founded them.

<sup>12</sup> North and south – You have created them; Taḇor and Ḥermon rejoice in Your Name.

<sup>13</sup> You have a mighty arm, Your hand is strong, Your right hand exalted.

<sup>14</sup> Righteousness and right-ruling Are the foundation of Your throne; Kindness and truth go before Your face.

<sup>15</sup> Blessed are the people Who know the festal trumpet-call! They walk, O יהוה, in the light of Your face.

<sup>16</sup> In Your Name they rejoice all day long, And they are exalted in Your righteousness .

<sup>17</sup> For You are the comeliness of their strength, And by Your good pleasure our horn is exalted.

<sup>18</sup> For יהוה is our shield, And the Set-apart One of Yisra’ĕl is our Sovereign.

<sup>19</sup> Then You spoke in a vision to Your kind one, And You said, “I have given help to one who is mighty, I have exalted one chosen from the people.

<sup>20</sup> “I have found My servant Dawiḏ; With My set-apart oil I anointed him,

<sup>21</sup> “With whom My hand is established; My arm also strengthens him.

<sup>22</sup> “No enemy subjects him to tribute, And no son of wickedness afflicts him.

<sup>23</sup> “And I shall beat down His adversaries before his face, And plague those who hate him.

<sup>24</sup> “But My trustworthiness And My kindness are with him, And in My Name his horn is exalted.

<sup>25</sup> “And I shall set his hand on the sea, And his right hand on the rivers.

<sup>26</sup> “He calls out to Me, ‘You are my Father, My Ĕl, and the rock of my deliverance.’

<sup>27</sup> “I also appoint him first-born, Highest of the sovereigns of the earth.

<sup>28</sup> “I guard My kindness for him forever, And My covenant is steadfast with him.

<sup>29</sup> “And I shall establish his seed forever, And his throne as the days of the heavens.

<sup>30</sup> “If his sons forsake My Torah And do not walk in My right-rulings,

<sup>31</sup> “If they profane My laws And do not guard My commands,

<sup>32</sup> “Then I shall visit their transgression with the rod, And their crookedness with flogging.

<sup>33</sup> “But My kindness I do not take away from him, Nor be false to My trustworthiness.

<sup>34</sup> “I shall not profane My covenant, Neither would I change what has gone out from My lips.

<sup>35</sup> “Once I have sworn by My set-apartness, I do not lie to Dawiḏ:

<sup>36</sup> “His seed shall be forever, And his throne as the sun before Me;

<sup>37</sup> “Like the moon, it is established forever, And the witness in the heaven is steadfast.” Selah.

<sup>38</sup> Yet You have rejected and spurned, You have been wroth with Your anointed.

<sup>39</sup> You have disowned the covenant of Your servant, You have defiled his diadem in the dust.

<sup>40</sup> You have broken down all his hedges, You have brought his strongholds to ruin.

<sup>41</sup> All who pass by the way plunder him; He is a reproach to his neighbours.

<sup>42</sup> You have exalted the right hand of his adversaries, You have made all his enemies rejoice.

<sup>43</sup> Moreover You have turned back the edge of his sword, And have not made him stand in battle.

<sup>44</sup> You have brought an end to his splendour, And have hurled his throne to the ground.

<sup>45</sup> You have shortened the days of his youth, You have covered him with shame. Selah.

<sup>46</sup> How long, O יהוה, would You be hidden? Would Your wrath burn like fire forever?

<sup>47</sup> Please remember how short my time is; Why should you have created all the sons of men for naught?

<sup>48</sup> What man would live and not see death? Who rescues his life from the power of the grave? Selah.

<sup>49</sup> יהוה, where are Your former kindnesses, Which You swore to Dawiḏ in Your trustworthiness?

<sup>50</sup> יהוה, remember the reproach of Your servants, That I have borne in my bosom – Of all the many peoples,

<sup>51</sup> With which Your enemies have reproached, O יהוה, With which they have reproached the footsteps of Your anointed.

<sup>52</sup> Blessed be יהוה forever! Amĕn and Amĕn.
