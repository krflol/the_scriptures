<sup>1</sup> Great is יהוה, and greatly to be praised In the city of our Elohim, His set-apart mountain.

<sup>2</sup> Pretty on high, The joy of all the earth, Is Mount Tsiyon on the sides of the north, The city of the great Sovereign.

<sup>3</sup> Elohim is in her citadels; He is known as her refuge.

<sup>4</sup> For look, the sovereigns met, They passed by together.

<sup>5</sup> They saw, so they marvelled; They were alarmed, they hastened away.

<sup>6</sup> Trembling took hold of them there, Pain, as of a woman in labour,

<sup>7</sup> With an east wind You break the ships of Tarshish.

<sup>8</sup> As we have heard, so we have seen In the city of יהוה of hosts, In the city of our Elohim, Elohim establishes her forever. Selah.

<sup>9</sup> We have thought, O Elohim, of Your kindness, In the midst of Your Hĕḵal.

<sup>10</sup> According to Your Name, O Elohim, So is Your praise to the ends of the earth; Your right hand is filled with righteousness.

<sup>11</sup> Let Mount Tsiyon rejoice, Let the daughters of Yehuḏah exult, Because of Your right-rulings.

<sup>12</sup> Walk about Tsiyon, And go all around her. Count her towers;

<sup>13</sup> Set your heart upon her rampart; Go through her citadels; So that you report it to the coming generation.

<sup>14</sup> For this Elohim is our Elohim, Forever and ever; He Himself leads us, Even to death.
