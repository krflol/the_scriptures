<sup>1</sup> Elohim arises, His enemies are scattered. And those who hate Him flee before Him!

<sup>2</sup> As smoke is driven away, You drive them away; As wax melts before the fire, The wrong perish before Elohim.

<sup>3</sup> But the righteous are glad, They exult before Elohim. And they rejoice with gladness.

<sup>4</sup> Sing to Elohim, sing praises to His Name. Raise up a highway for Him Who rides through the deserts, By His Name Yah, And exult before Him.

<sup>5</sup> Father of the fatherless, And Right-ruler of widows, Is Elohim in His set-apart dwelling.

<sup>6</sup> Elohim makes a home for the lonely; He brings out into prosperity Those who are bound with chains; Only the rebellious shall dwell in a dry land.

<sup>7</sup> O Elohim, when You went out before Your people, When You stepped through the wilderness, Selah.

<sup>8</sup> The earth shook and the heavens dropped before Elohim, This Sinai, shook before Elohim, the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl.

<sup>9</sup> You, O Elohim, sent a shower of plenty, You confirmed Your inheritance, When it was weary.

<sup>10</sup> Your flock dwelt in it; You provided from Your goodness for the poor, O Elohim.

<sup>11</sup> יהוה gave the word; The women who proclaimed it was a great company:

<sup>12</sup> “Sovereigns of armies flee in haste! And she who remains at home divides the spoil.”

<sup>13</sup> If you lie down among the sheepfolds, The wings of a dove are covered with silver, And her feathers with yellow gold.

<sup>14</sup> When the Almighty scattered sovereigns in it, It did snow in Tsalmon.

<sup>15</sup> A mountain of Elohim is the mountain of Bashan; A mountain of peaks is the mountain of Bashan.

<sup>16</sup> O mountain of peaks, why do you gaze in envy At the mountain which Elohim desired to dwell in; יהוה even dwells there forever.

<sup>17</sup> The chariots of Elohim are twenty thousand, Thousands of thousands; יהוה came from Sinai Into the Set-apart Place.

<sup>18</sup> You have ascended on high, You have led captivity captive, You have received gifts among men, And even the rebellious, That Yah Elohim might dwell there.

<sup>19</sup> Blessed be יהוה, Day by day He bears our burden, The Ĕl of our deliverance! Selah.

<sup>20</sup> Our Ĕl is the Ĕl of deliverance; And to יהוה, the Master, belong escapes from death.

<sup>21</sup> Indeed, Elohim smites the head of His enemies, The hairy scalp of him who walks about in His guilt.

<sup>22</sup> יהוה said, “I bring back from Bashan, I bring back from the depths of the sea,

<sup>23</sup> “So that you plunge your foot in blood; That the tongues of your dogs Have their portion from the enemies.”

<sup>24</sup> They have seen Your goings, O Elohim, The goings of my Ĕl, my Sovereign, Into the set-apart place.

<sup>25</sup> The singers went in front, The players on instruments after them; Among them were the maidens playing tambourines.

<sup>26</sup> Bless Elohim in the assemblies, יהוה, from the fountain of Yisra’ĕl.

<sup>27</sup> There is Binyamin, the smallest, their ruler, The leaders of Yehuḏah, their company, The leader of Zeḇulun, the leader of Naphtali.

<sup>28</sup> Your Elohim has commanded your strength, be strong! O Elohim, this You have worked out for us!

<sup>29</sup> Because of Your Hĕḵal at Yerushalayim, Sovereigns bring presents to You.

<sup>30</sup> Rebuke the wild beasts of the reeds, The herd of bulls, with the calves of the peoples, Each one humbling himself with pieces of silver. Scatter the peoples who delight in conflicts!

<sup>31</sup> Ambassadors come out of Mitsrayim; Kush stretches out her hands to Elohim.

<sup>32</sup> Sing to Elohim, you reigns of the earth, Praises to יהוה, Selah.

<sup>33</sup> To Him who rides on the ancient highest heavens! See, He sends out His voice, a mighty voice.

<sup>34</sup> Ascribe strength to Elohim; His excellence is over Yisra’ĕl, And His strength is in the clouds.

<sup>35</sup> O Elohim, awesome from Your set-apart places, The Ĕl of Yisra’ĕl is He Who gives strength and power to His people. Blessed be Elohim!

<sup>1</sup> Elohim arises, His enemies are scattered. And those who hate Him flee before Him!

<sup>2</sup> As smoke is driven away, You drive them away; As wax melts before the fire, The wrong perish before Elohim.

<sup>3</sup> But the righteous are glad, They exult before Elohim. And they rejoice with gladness.

<sup>4</sup> Sing to Elohim, sing praises to His Name. Raise up a highway for Him Who rides through the deserts, By His Name Yah, And exult before Him.
