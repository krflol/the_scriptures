<sup>1</sup> O יהוה, how my adversaries have increased! Many rising up against me.

<sup>2</sup> Many are saying of me, “There is no deliverance for him in Elohim.” Selah.

<sup>3</sup> But You, O יהוה, are a shield for me, My esteem, and the One lifting up my head.

<sup>4</sup> I cried to יהוה with my voice, And He heard me from His set-apart mountain. Selah.

<sup>5</sup> I, I laid down and slept; I awoke, for יהוה sustained me.

<sup>6</sup> I am not afraid of ten thousands of people Who have set themselves against me all around.

<sup>7</sup> Arise, O יהוה ; Save me, O my Elohim! Because You have smitten all my enemies on the cheek; You have broken the teeth of the wrong.

<sup>8</sup> Deliverance belongs to יהוה. Your blessing is on Your people. Selah.
