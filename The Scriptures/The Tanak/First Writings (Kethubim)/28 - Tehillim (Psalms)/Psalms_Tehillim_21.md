<sup>1</sup> The sovereign rejoices in Your strength, O יהוה ; And how greatly he exults in Your deliverance!

<sup>2</sup> You have given him the desire of his heart, And You have not withheld the request of his lips. Selah.

<sup>3</sup> For You put before him the blessings of goodness; You set a crown of fine gold on his head.

<sup>4</sup> He asked life from You, and You gave it to him – Length of days forever and ever.

<sup>5</sup> Through Your deliverance his esteem is great; You have laid excellency and splendour on him.

<sup>6</sup> For You have made him most blessed forever; You have made him glad with the joy of Your presence.

<sup>7</sup> For the sovereign is trusting in יהוה, And through the kindness of the Most High he is not moved.

<sup>8</sup> Your hand reaches all Your enemies; Your right hand reaches those who hate You.

<sup>9</sup> You make them as a furnace of fire in the time of Your presence; יהוה does swallow them up in His wrath, And fire does consume them.

<sup>10</sup> You destroy their fruit from the earth, And their seed from among the sons of men.

<sup>11</sup> For they held out evil against You; They devised a plot; they do not prevail.

<sup>12</sup> For You make them turn their back, When You aim with Your bowstring toward their faces.

<sup>13</sup> Be exalted, O יהוה, in Your strength! We sing and we praise Your might.
