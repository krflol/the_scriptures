<sup>1</sup> “Often they have distressed me from my youth.” Let Yisra’ĕl now say,

<sup>2</sup> “Often they have distressed me from my youth, But they have not overcome me.

<sup>3</sup> “The ploughers ploughed on my back, They made their furrows long.”

<sup>4</sup> יהוה is righteous, He has cut the cords of the wrong in two.

<sup>5</sup> Let all those who hate Tsiyon Be put to shame and turned back.

<sup>6</sup> Let them be as the grass on the house-tops, Which withers before it grows up,

<sup>7</sup> That shall not fill the reaper’s hand, Nor the sheaves fill the binder’s bosom.

<sup>8</sup> And those who pass by shall not say, “The blessing of יהוה be upon you; We have blessed you in the Name of יהוה !”
