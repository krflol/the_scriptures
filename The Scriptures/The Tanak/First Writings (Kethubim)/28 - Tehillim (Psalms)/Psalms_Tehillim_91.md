<sup>1</sup> He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High, Who abides under the shadow of the Almighty,

<sup>2</sup> He is saying of יהוה, “My refuge and my stronghold, My Elohim, in whom I trust!”

<sup>3</sup> For He delivers you from the snare of a trapper, From the destructive pestilence.

<sup>4</sup> He covers you with His feathers, And under His wings you take refuge; His truth is a shield and armour.

<sup>5</sup> You are not afraid of the dread by night, Of the arrow that flies by day,

<sup>6</sup> Of the pestilence that walks in darkness, Of destruction that ravages at midday.

<sup>7</sup> A thousand fall at your side, And ten thousand at your right hand; But it does not come near you.

<sup>8</sup> Only with your eyes you look on, And see the reward of the wrong ones.

<sup>9</sup> Because you have made יהוה – My refuge, the Most High – your dwelling place,

<sup>10</sup> No evil befalls you, And a plague does not come near your tent;

<sup>11</sup> For He commands His messengers concerning you, To guard you in all your ways.

<sup>12</sup> They bear you up in their hands, Lest you dash your foot against a stone.

<sup>13</sup> You tread upon lion and cobra, Young lion and serpent you trample under foot.

<sup>14</sup> “Because he cleaves to Me in love, Therefore I deliver him; I set him on high, Because he has known My Name.

<sup>15</sup> “When he calls on Me, I answer him; I am with him in distress; I deliver him and esteem him.

<sup>16</sup> “With long life I satisfy him, And show him My deliverance.”
