<sup>1</sup> I sing of kindness and right-ruling; To You, O יהוה, I sing praises.

<sup>2</sup> I act wisely in a perfect way. When do You come to me? I walk in the midst of my house with a perfect heart.

<sup>3</sup> I set no matter of Beliya‛al before my eyes; I hate the work of those who fall away; It does not cleave to me.

<sup>4</sup> A perverse heart turns away from me; I do not know evil.

<sup>5</sup> Him who secretly slanders his neighbour I cut off; I do not tolerate one Who has a haughty look and a proud heart.

<sup>6</sup> My eyes are on the trustworthy of the land, To dwell with me; He who walks in a perfect way, He serves me.

<sup>7</sup> He who practises deceit Does not dwell in my house; He who speaks lies Does not stand in my presence.

<sup>8</sup> Each morning I uproot all the wrong of the land, To cut off all the workers of wickedness From the city of יהוה.
