<sup>1</sup> When Yisra’ĕl went out of Mitsrayim, The house of Ya‛aqoḇ from a people of strange language,

<sup>2</sup> Yehuḏah became His set-apart place, And Yisra’ĕl His rule.

<sup>3</sup> The sea saw it and fled; The Yardĕn turned back.

<sup>4</sup> The mountains skipped like rams, The little hills like lambs.

<sup>5</sup> Why was it, O sea, that you fled? O Yardĕn, that you turned back?

<sup>6</sup> O mountains, that you skipped like rams? O little hills, like lambs?

<sup>7</sup> Tremble, O earth, from the face of the Master, From the face of the Eloah of Ya‛aqoḇ,

<sup>8</sup> Who turned the rock into a pool of water, The flint into a fountain of water.
