<sup>1</sup> O Elohim, we have heard with our ears, Our fathers have related to us, The work You did in their days, In the days of old.

<sup>2</sup> You drove out the nations with Your hand, But them You planted. You afflicted peoples, and sent them out.

<sup>3</sup> For not by their own sword did they possess the land, Neither did their own arm save them; But it was Your right hand and Your arm, And the light of Your face, Because You delighted in them.

<sup>4</sup> You Yourself are my Sovereign, O Elohim; Command deliverances for Ya‛aqoḇ.

<sup>5</sup> Through You we push our enemies; Through Your Name we tread down those who rise up against us.

<sup>6</sup> For I do not trust in my bow, And my sword does not save me.

<sup>7</sup> For You have saved us from our enemies, And have put to shame those who hated us.

<sup>8</sup> In Elohim we shall boast all day long, And praise Your Name forever. Selah.

<sup>9</sup> Yet You have rejected us and put us to shame, And You do not go with our armies.

<sup>10</sup> You make us turn back from the adversary, And those who hate us have plundered us.

<sup>11</sup> You do give us as sheep to be eaten, And You have scattered us among the gentiles.

<sup>12</sup> You sell Your people for no value, And have set no high price on them.

<sup>13</sup> You make us a reproach to our neighbours, A scorn and a mockery to those round about us.

<sup>14</sup> You make us a proverb among the nations, A shaking of the head among the peoples.

<sup>15</sup> My reproach is always before me, And the shame of my face has covered me,

<sup>16</sup> Because of the voice of the slanderer and blasphemer, Because of the enemy and avenger.

<sup>17</sup> All this has come upon us; But we have not forgotten You, Neither have we been false to Your covenant.

<sup>18</sup> Our heart has not turned back, Neither has our step swerved from Your way,

<sup>19</sup> Yet You have crushed us in the place of jackals, And covered us with the shadow of death.

<sup>20</sup> If we have forgotten the Name of our Elohim, Or stretched out our hands to a foreign mighty one,

<sup>21</sup> Would Elohim not search this out? For He knows the secrets of the heart.

<sup>22</sup> But for Your sake we are killed all day long; Reckoned as sheep for the slaughter.

<sup>23</sup> Awake! Why do You sleep, O יהוה ? Arise! Do not reject us forever.

<sup>24</sup> Why do You hide Your face, Ignoring our affliction and our oppression?

<sup>25</sup> For our being is bowed down to the dust; Our body cleaves to the earth.

<sup>26</sup> Arise, be our help, And redeem us for Your kindness’ sake.
