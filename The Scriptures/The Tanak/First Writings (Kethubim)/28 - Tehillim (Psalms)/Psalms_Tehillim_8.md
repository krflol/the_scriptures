<sup>1</sup> O יהוה, our Master, how excellent is Your Name in all the earth, You who set Your splendour above the heavens!

<sup>2</sup> Out of the mouth of babes and infants You have founded strength, Because of Your adversaries, To put an end to enemy and avenger.

<sup>3</sup> For I see Your heavens, the work of Your fingers, The moon and the stars, which You have established.

<sup>4</sup> What is man that You remember him? And the son of man that You visit him?

<sup>5</sup> Yet You have made him a little less than Elohim, And have crowned him with esteem and splendour.

<sup>6</sup> You made him rule over the works of Your hands; You have put all under his feet,

<sup>7</sup> All sheep and oxen, And also the beasts of the field,

<sup>8</sup> The birds of the heavens, And the fish of the sea, Passing through the paths of the seas.

<sup>9</sup> O יהוה, our Master, How excellent is Your Name in all the earth!
