<sup>1</sup> Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, Whose sin is covered.

<sup>2</sup> Blessed is the man to whom יהוה imputes no crookedness, And in whose spirit there is no deceit.

<sup>3</sup> When I kept silent, my bones became old Through my groaning all the day.

<sup>4</sup> For day and night Your hand was heavy upon me; My sap was turned into the droughts of summer. Selah.

<sup>5</sup> I acknowledged my sin to You, And my crookedness I did not hide. I have said, “I confess my transgressions to יהוה,” And You forgave the crookedness of my sin. Selah.

<sup>6</sup> Therefore, let every kind one pray to You While You might be found; Even in a flood of great waters They would not reach him.

<sup>7</sup> You are my hiding place; You preserve me from distress; You surround me with songs of deliverance. Selah.

<sup>8</sup> “Let Me instruct you and teach you in the way you should go; Let Me counsel, My eye be on you.

<sup>9</sup> Do not be like the horse, like the mule, With no understanding, with bit and bridle, Else they do not come near you.”

<sup>10</sup> Many are the sorrows of the wrong; But as for the one trusting in יהוה, Kindness surrounds him.

<sup>11</sup> Be glad in יהוה and exult, you righteous; And shout for joy, all you upright in heart!
