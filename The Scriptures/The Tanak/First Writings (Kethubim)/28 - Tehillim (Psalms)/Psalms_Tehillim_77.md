<sup>1</sup> My voice is to Elohim, and I cry; My voice is to Elohim, and He listened to me.

<sup>2</sup> In the day of my distress I sought יהוה ; My hand was stretched out in the night And it did not cease, My being refused to be comforted.

<sup>3</sup> I remembered Elohim, and groaned; I complained, and my spirit grew faint. Selah.

<sup>4</sup> You ceased the watches of my eyes, I was too troubled to speak.

<sup>5</sup> I have thought about the days of old, The years long past.

<sup>6</sup> I remember my song in the night, I meditate within my heart, And my spirit searches diligently.

<sup>7</sup> Would יהוה reject forever, And never again be pleased?

<sup>8</sup> Has His kindness ceased forever, Has the promise failed for all generations?

<sup>9</sup> Has Ĕl forgotten to show favour? Has He shut up His compassions in displeasure? Selah.

<sup>10</sup> And I said, “This is my grief: That the right hand of the Most High has changed.”

<sup>11</sup> I remember the deeds of Yah, For I remember Your wonders of old.

<sup>12</sup> And I shall meditate on all Your work, And talk of Your deeds.

<sup>13</sup> Your way, O Elohim, is in Set-apartness; Who is a great Ĕl like Elohim?

<sup>14</sup> You are the Ĕl who does wonders; You have made known Your strength among the peoples.

<sup>15</sup> By Your arm You have redeemed Your people, The sons of Ya‛aqoḇ and Yosĕph. Selah.

<sup>16</sup> The waters saw You, O Elohim; The waters saw You, they were afraid; The depths also trembled.

<sup>17</sup> The clouds poured out water; The heavens rumbled; Also, Your arrows flashed back and forth.

<sup>18</sup> The voice of Your thunder rolled along; Lightnings lit up the world; The earth trembled and shook.

<sup>19</sup> Your way was in the sea, And Your path in the great waters, And Your footsteps were not known.

<sup>20</sup> You did lead Your people like a flock By the hand of Mosheh and Aharon.
