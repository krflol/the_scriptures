<sup>1</sup> יהוה, You shall take pleasure in Your land; You shall turn back the captivity of Ya‛aqoḇ.

<sup>2</sup> You shall take away the crookedness of Your people; You shall cover all their sin. Selah.

<sup>3</sup> You shall withdraw all Your wrath; You shall turn from Your fierce displeasure.

<sup>4</sup> Turn back to us, O Elohim of our deliverance, And cause Your vexation toward us to cease.

<sup>5</sup> Would You be enraged with us forever? Would You draw out Your displeasure From generation to generation?

<sup>6</sup> Would You not revive us again, For Your people to rejoice in You?

<sup>7</sup> Show us Your kindness, O יהוה, And give us Your deliverance.

<sup>8</sup> Let me hear what Ĕl יהוה speaks, For He speaks peace to His people And to His kind ones; And let them not turn again to folly.

<sup>9</sup> Truly, His deliverance is near to those who fear Him, For esteem to dwell in our land.

<sup>10</sup> Kindness and truth shall meet, Righteousness and peace shall kiss.

<sup>11</sup> Truth sprouts forth from the earth, And righteousness looks down from heaven,

<sup>12</sup> Indeed, יהוה gives what is good, And our land yields its increase.

<sup>13</sup> Righteousness goes before Him, And prepares a way for His footsteps.
