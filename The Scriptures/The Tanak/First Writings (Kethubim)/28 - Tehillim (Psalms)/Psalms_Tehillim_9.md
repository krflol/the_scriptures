<sup>1</sup> I praise You, O יהוה, with all my heart; I declare all Your wonders.

<sup>2</sup> I rejoice and exult in You; I sing praise to Your Name, O Most High.

<sup>3</sup> When my enemies turn back, They stumble and perish before You.

<sup>4</sup> For You executed my right and my cause, You sat on the throne judging in righteousness.

<sup>5</sup> You have rebuked the gentiles, You have destroyed the wrong, You have wiped out their name forever and ever.

<sup>6</sup> The enemy is no more – ruins everlasting! And You have uprooted the cities; Even their remembrance has perished.

<sup>7</sup> But יהוה abides forever, He is preparing His throne for judgment.

<sup>8</sup> And He judges the world in righteousness, He judges the peoples in straightness.

<sup>9</sup> And יהוה is a refuge for the crushed one, A refuge in times of distress.

<sup>10</sup> And those who know Your Name trust in You, For You have not forsaken those who seek You, O יהוה.

<sup>11</sup> Sing praises to יהוה, who dwells in Tsiyon! Declare His deeds among the peoples.

<sup>12</sup> For He remembers the seekers of bloodshed, He does not forget the cry of the afflicted.

<sup>13</sup> Show favour to me, O יהוה ! See my affliction by those who hate me, You who lift me up from the gates of death,

<sup>14</sup> So that I declare all Your praise In the gates of the daughter of Tsiyon. I rejoice in Your deliverance.

<sup>15</sup> The gentiles have sunk down in the pit which they made; In the net which they hid, their own foot is caught.

<sup>16</sup> יהוה has made Himself known, He has done right-ruling; The wrong is snared in the work of his own hands. Meditation. Selah.

<sup>17</sup> The wrong return to the grave, All the gentiles that forget Elohim.

<sup>18</sup> For the needy is not always forgotten; Neither the expectancy of the poor lost forever.

<sup>19</sup> Arise, O יהוה, Do not let man prevail; Let the gentiles be judged before Your face.

<sup>20</sup> Put them in fear, O יהוה, Let the gentiles know they are but men. Selah.
