<sup>1</sup> Why do You stand afar off, O יהוה, hiding in times of distress?

<sup>2</sup> In arrogance the wrongdoer hotly pursues the poor; They are caught by the schemes which they devised.

<sup>3</sup> For the wrongdoer boasted of his cravings; And the greedy one cursed and despised יהוה.

<sup>4</sup> In the pride of his face The wrongdoer does not seek Him, In all his thoughts there is no Elohim!

<sup>5</sup> His ways are always prosperous! Your right-rulings are on high, out of his sight! He snorts at all his adversaries!

<sup>6</sup> He has said in his heart, “I shall not be moved; From generation to generation, never be in evil!”

<sup>7</sup> His mouth is filled with cursing and deceit and oppression; Under his tongue is trouble and wickedness.

<sup>8</sup> He sits in the hiding places of the villages; In the secret places he murders the innocent; His eyes are on the lookout for the helpless.

<sup>9</sup> He lies in wait in a secret place, as a lion in his den; He lies in wait to catch the poor; He catches the poor, drawing him into his net.

<sup>10</sup> And he crouches, he lies low, And the helpless fall under his strength.

<sup>11</sup> He has said in his heart, “Ĕl has forgotten, He has hidden His face, He shall never see.”

<sup>12</sup> Arise, O יהוה ! O Ĕl, lift up Your hand! Do not forget the lowly ones.

<sup>13</sup> Why do the wrong scorn Elohim? He has said in his heart, “It is not required.”

<sup>14</sup> You have seen it, for You observe trouble and grief, To repay with Your hand. The poor commits himself to You; You are the helper of the fatherless.

<sup>15</sup> Break the arm of the wrong one and the evil one; Search out his wrongness that would not be found out.

<sup>16</sup> יהוה is Sovereign forever and ever; The gentiles shall perish from His land.

<sup>17</sup> יהוה, You have heard the desire of the lowly ones; You prepare their heart; You incline Your ear,

<sup>18</sup> To defend the fatherless and the downtrodden; So that man who is of the earth no longer oppresses!
