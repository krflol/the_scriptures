<sup>1</sup> O Elohim, You have rejected us; You have broken us; You have been displeased; Turn back to us!

<sup>2</sup> You have made the earth tremble; You have broken it; Heal its breaches, for it is shaken.

<sup>3</sup> You have let Your people see hardship; You have made us drink the wine of trembling.

<sup>4</sup> You have given a banner to those who fear You, That it might be lifted up Because of the truth. Selah.

<sup>5</sup> That those You love might be rescued, Save with Your right hand and answer me.

<sup>6</sup> Elohim has spoken in His set-apartness, “I exult, I portion out Sheḵem And measure out the Valley of Sukkoth.

<sup>7</sup> “Gil‛aḏ is Mine and Menashsheh is Mine, And Ephrayim is the defence of My head, Yehuḏah is My lawgiver.

<sup>8</sup> “Mo’aḇ is My wash-pot, Over Eḏom I cast My shoe, Shout loud, O Philistia, because of Me.”

<sup>9</sup> Who would bring me to the strong city? Who shall lead me to Eḏom?

<sup>10</sup> Have not You, O Elohim, rejected us? And You do not go out, O Elohim, With our armies!

<sup>11</sup> Give us help from distress, For the help of man is naught.

<sup>12</sup> In Elohim we do mightily, And He treads down our adversaries!
