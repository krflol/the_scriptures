<sup>1</sup> Rule me rightly, O Elohim, And plead my cause against a nation without kindness. Oh, deliver me from a man of deceit and unrighteousness!

<sup>2</sup> For You are the Elohim of my strength. Why have You rejected me? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?

<sup>3</sup> Send forth Your light and Your truth! Let them lead me, Let them bring me to Your set-apart mountain And to Your dwelling places.

<sup>4</sup> That I might come to the altar of Elohim, To Ĕl, the joy of my delight, And praise You with the lyre, O Elohim, my Elohim.

<sup>5</sup> Why are you depressed, O my being? And why are you restless within me? Wait for Elohim: for I shall yet thank Him, the deliverance of my face, And my Elohim.
