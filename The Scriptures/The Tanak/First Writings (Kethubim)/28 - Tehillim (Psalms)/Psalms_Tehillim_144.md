<sup>1</sup> Blessed be יהוה my Rock, Who is teaching my hands for fighting, My fingers for battle;

<sup>2</sup> My kindness and my stronghold, My tower and my deliverer, My shield, and in whom I take refuge, Who is subduing peoples under me.

<sup>3</sup> יהוה, what is man, that You should know him? Son of man, that You should think of him?

<sup>4</sup> Man is like a breath, His days like a passing shadow.

<sup>5</sup> Incline Your heavens, O יהוה, and come down; Touch the mountains that they smoke.

<sup>6</sup> Send forth lightning and scatter them, Send forth Your arrows and confuse them.

<sup>7</sup> Send forth Your hand from above; Rescue me and deliver me out of great waters, From the hand of foreigners,

<sup>8</sup> Whose mouth has spoken falsehood, And whose right hand is a right hand of lies.

<sup>9</sup> O Elohim, a new song I sing to You; On a harp of ten strings I sing praises to You,

<sup>10</sup> Who gives deliverance to sovereigns, Who rescues Dawiḏ His servant From the evil sword.

<sup>11</sup> Rescue me and deliver me from the hand of foreigners, Whose mouth has spoken falsehood, And whose right hand is a right hand of lies;

<sup>12</sup> Because our sons are like plants Grown up in their youth; Our daughters like hewn stones, Polished, like a palace building;

<sup>13</sup> Let our storehouses be filled, Supplying all kinds; Let our sheep bring forth thousands And ten thousands in our fields;

<sup>14</sup> Our cattle well-laden; No breaking in, no going out; And no crying in our streets.

<sup>15</sup> Blessed are the people who have it so; Blessed are the people whose Elohim is יהוה !
