<sup>1</sup> Oh, clap your hands, all you peoples! Shout to Elohim with a voice of singing!

<sup>2</sup> For יהוה Most High is awesome; A great Sovereign over all the earth.

<sup>3</sup> He subdues peoples under us, And nations under our feet.

<sup>4</sup> He chooses our inheritance for us, The excellence of Ya‛aqoḇ whom He loves. Selah.

<sup>5</sup> Elohim shall go up with a shout, יהוה with the sound of a ram’s horn.

<sup>6</sup> Sing praises to Elohim, sing praises! Sing praises to our Sovereign, sing praises!

<sup>7</sup> For Elohim is Sovereign of all the earth; Sing praises with understanding.

<sup>8</sup> Elohim shall reign over the nations; Elohim shall sit on His set-apart throne.

<sup>9</sup> Nobles of peoples shall be gathered together, The people of the Elohim of Aḇraham. For the shields of the earth belong to Elohim; He shall be greatly exalted.
