<sup>1</sup> Bless יהוה, O my being, And all that is within me, Bless His set-apart Name!

<sup>2</sup> Bless יהוה, O my being, And do not forget all His dealings,

<sup>3</sup> Who forgives all your crookednesses, Who heals all your diseases,

<sup>4</sup> Who redeems your life from destruction, Who crowns you with kindness and compassion,

<sup>5</sup> Who satisfies your desire with the good, Your youth is renewed like the eagle’s.

<sup>6</sup> יהוה is doing righteousness And right-ruling for all the oppressed.

<sup>7</sup> He made known His ways to Mosheh, His acts to the children of Yisra’ĕl.

<sup>8</sup> יהוה is compassionate and showing favour, Patient, and great in kindness.

<sup>9</sup> He does not always strive, nor maintain it forever.

<sup>10</sup> He has not done to us according to our sins, Nor rewarded us according to our crookednesses.

<sup>11</sup> For as the heavens are high above the earth, So great is His kindness toward those who fear Him;

<sup>12</sup> As far as east is from west, So far has He removed our transgressions from us.

<sup>13</sup> As a father has compassion for his children, So יהוה has compassion for those who fear Him.

<sup>14</sup> For He knows how we are made; He remembers that we are dust.

<sup>15</sup> As a flower of the field, so he flourishes.

<sup>16</sup> For the wind blows over it, and it is no more, And its place no longer remembers it.

<sup>17</sup> But the kindness of יהוה Is from everlasting to everlasting Upon those who fear Him, And His righteousness to children’s children,

<sup>18</sup> To those who guard His covenant, And to those who remember His orders to do them.

<sup>19</sup> יהוה has established His throne in the heavens, And His reign shall rule over all.

<sup>20</sup> Bless יהוה, you His messengers, Mighty in power, who do His Word, Listening to the voice of His Word.

<sup>21</sup> Bless יהוה, all you His hosts, You His servants, who do His pleasure.

<sup>22</sup> Bless יהוה, all His works, In all places of His rule. Bless יהוה, O my being!
