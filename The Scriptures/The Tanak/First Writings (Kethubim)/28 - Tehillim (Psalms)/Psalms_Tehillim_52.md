<sup>1</sup> Why do you boast in evil, O mighty man? The kindness of Ĕl is all day long!

<sup>2</sup> Your tongue devises destruction, Like a sharp razor, working deceit.

<sup>3</sup> You loved evil more than good, Lying more than speaking righteousness. Selah.

<sup>4</sup> You loved all devouring words, O tongue of deceit.

<sup>5</sup> Let Ĕl also break you down forever, Take you and pluck you out of your tent. And He shall uproot you From the land of the living. Selah.

<sup>6</sup> And let the righteous see and fear, And laugh at him, saying,

<sup>7</sup> “See the man who did not make Elohim his strength, But trusted in his many riches, Being strong in his destruction.”

<sup>8</sup> But I am like a green olive tree In the House of Elohim, I have trusted in the kindness of Elohim Forever and ever.

<sup>9</sup> I thank You forever, Because You have done it; And in the presence of Your kind ones I wait on Your Name, for it is good.
