<sup>1</sup> How long would You forget me, O יהוה ? Forever? How long would You hide Your face from me?

<sup>2</sup> How long would I take counsel in my being, Grief in my heart day by day? How long would my enemy be exalted over me?

<sup>3</sup> Look! Answer me, O יהוה my Elohim; Enlighten my eyes, Lest I sleep in death;

<sup>4</sup> Lest my enemy say, “I have prevailed against him,” Lest my adversaries rejoice when I am moved.

<sup>5</sup> But I have trusted in Your kindness; My heart rejoices in Your deliverance.

<sup>6</sup> I sing to יהוה, Because He has been good to me.
