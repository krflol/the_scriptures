<sup>1</sup> Oh, give thanks to יהוה, for He is good! Because His kindness is everlasting.

<sup>2</sup> Let Yisra’ĕl now say, “His kindness is everlasting.”

<sup>3</sup> Let the house of Aharon now say, “His kindness is everlasting.”

<sup>4</sup> Let those who fear יהוה now say, “His kindness is everlasting.”

<sup>5</sup> I called on Yah in distress; Yah answered me in a broad place.

<sup>6</sup> יהוה is on my side; I do not fear what man does to me!

<sup>7</sup> יהוה is for me among those helping me; Therefore I look on those hating me.

<sup>8</sup> It is better to take refuge in יהוה Than to trust in man.

<sup>9</sup> It is better to take refuge in יהוה Than to trust in princes.

<sup>10</sup> All the gentiles surrounded me, In the Name of יהוה I shall cut them off.

<sup>11</sup> They surrounded me, Yea, they surrounded me; In the Name of יהוה shall I cut them off.

<sup>12</sup> They surrounded me like bees; They were extinguished like burning thorns; In the Name of יהוה I shall cut them off.

<sup>13</sup> Pushing, the enemy pushed me to fall, But יהוה helped me.

<sup>14</sup> Yah is my strength and song, And He has become my deliverance.

<sup>15</sup> The voice of rejoicing and deliverance Is in the tents of the righteous; The right hand of יהוה is doing mightily.

<sup>16</sup> The right hand of יהוה is exalted, The right hand of יהוה acts mightily.

<sup>17</sup> Let me not die, but live, And declare the works of Yah.

<sup>18</sup> Yah has punished me severely, But did not give me over to death.

<sup>19</sup> Open to me the gates of righteousness; I enter through them, I thank Yah.

<sup>20</sup> This is the gate of יהוה, The righteous enter through it.

<sup>21</sup> I thank You, For You have answered me, And have become my deliverance.

<sup>22</sup> The stone which the builders rejected Has become the chief corner-stone.

<sup>23</sup> This was from יהוה, It is marvellous in our eyes.

<sup>24</sup> This is the day יהוה has made, Let us rejoice and be glad in it.

<sup>25</sup> I pray, O יהוה, please save; I pray, O יהוה, please send prosperity.

<sup>26</sup> Blessed is He who is coming in the Name of יהוה ! We shall bless you from the House of יהוה.

<sup>27</sup> יהוה is Ĕl, and He gave us light; Bind the festal offering With cords to the horns of the altar.

<sup>28</sup> You are my Ĕl, and I praise You; You are my Elohim, I exalt You.

<sup>29</sup> Give thanks to יהוה, for He is good! For His kindness is everlasting.
