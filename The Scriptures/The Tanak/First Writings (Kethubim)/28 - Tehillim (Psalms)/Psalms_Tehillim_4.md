<sup>1</sup> Answer me when I call, O Elohim of my righteousness! You gave relief to me when I was in distress; Show favour to me, and hear my prayer.

<sup>2</sup> Till when, O you sons of men, Would you turn my esteem to shame, Would you love emptiness, seek falsehood? Selah.

<sup>3</sup> But know that יהוה has separated a kind one for Himself; יהוה hears when I call to Him.

<sup>4</sup> Tremble, and do not sin. Speak within your heart on your bed, and be still. Selah.

<sup>5</sup> Offer slaughterings of righteousness, And trust in יהוה.

<sup>6</sup> Many are saying, “Who would show us good?” יהוה, lift up the light of Your face upon us.

<sup>7</sup> You have put more gladness in my heart, Than in the season that their grain and wine increased.

<sup>8</sup> I lie down in peace altogether, and sleep; For You alone, O יהוה, make me dwell in safety.
