<sup>1</sup> Sing to יהוה a new song, Sing to יהוה, all the earth!

<sup>2</sup> Sing to יהוה, bless His Name, Proclaim His deliverance from day to day.

<sup>3</sup> Declare His esteem among the nations, His wonders among all peoples.

<sup>4</sup> For great is יהוה and greatly to be praised, He is to be feared above all mighty ones.

<sup>5</sup> For all the mighty ones of the peoples are matters of naught, But יהוה made the heavens.

<sup>6</sup> Excellency and splendour are before Him, Strength and comeliness are in His set-apart place.

<sup>7</sup> Ascribe to יהוה, O clans of the peoples, Ascribe to יהוה esteem and strength.

<sup>8</sup> Ascribe to יהוה the esteem of His Name; Bring an offering, and come into His courts.

<sup>9</sup> Bow yourselves to יהוה, In the splendour of set-apartness! Tremble before Him, all the earth.

<sup>10</sup> Say among nations, “ יהוה shall reign. The world also is established, immovable. He judges the peoples in straightness.”

<sup>11</sup> Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; Let the sea roar, and all that fills it;

<sup>12</sup> Let the field exult, and all that is in it. Let all the trees of the forest then shout for joy,

<sup>13</sup> At the presence of יהוה. For He shall come, For He shall come to judge the earth. He judges the world in righteousness, And the peoples with His truth.
