<sup>1</sup> I was glad when they said to me, “Let us go into the House of יהוה.”

<sup>2</sup> Our feet have been standing Within your gates, O Yerushalayim!

<sup>3</sup> Yerushalayim is built As a city that is bound together,

<sup>4</sup> Where the tribes have come up, The tribes of Yah, A witness to Yisra’ĕl, To give thanks to the Name of יהוה.

<sup>5</sup> For there the thrones of right-ruling were set, The thrones of the house of Dawiḏ.

<sup>6</sup> Pray for the peace of Yerushalayim, Let those who love You be at rest.

<sup>7</sup> Peace be within your walls, Rest in your citadels.

<sup>8</sup> For the sake of my brothers and companions, I say, “Peace be within you.”

<sup>9</sup> For the sake of the House of יהוה our Elohim I seek your good.
