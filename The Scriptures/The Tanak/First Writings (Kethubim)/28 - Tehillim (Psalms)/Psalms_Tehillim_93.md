<sup>1</sup> יהוה shall reign, He shall put on excellency; יהוה shall put on strength; He shall gird Himself. Indeed, the world is established, immovable.

<sup>2</sup> Your throne is established from of old; You are from everlasting.

<sup>3</sup> Rivers shall lift up, O יהוה, Rivers shall lift up their voice; Rivers lift up their breakers.

<sup>4</sup> יהוה on high is mightier Than the noise of many waters, The mighty breakers of the sea.

<sup>5</sup> Your witnesses have been very trustworthy. Set-apartness befits Your house, O יהוה, forever.
