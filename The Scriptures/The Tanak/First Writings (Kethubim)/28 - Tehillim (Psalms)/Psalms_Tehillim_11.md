<sup>1</sup> In יהוה I have taken refuge; Why do you say to me, “Flee to your mountain like a bird”?

<sup>2</sup> For look! The wrong bend a bow, They set their arrow on the string, To shoot in darkness at the upright in heart.

<sup>3</sup> When the foundations are destroyed, What shall the righteous do?

<sup>4</sup> יהוה is in His set-apart Hĕḵal, The throne of יהוה is in the heavens. His eyes see, His eyelids examine the sons of men.

<sup>5</sup> יהוה tries the righteous, But His being shall hate the wrong And the one who loves violence.

<sup>6</sup> Upon the wrong He rains snares, Fire and sulphur and a scorching wind Are the portion of their cup.

<sup>7</sup> For יהוה is righteous, He has loved righteousness; The upright shall see His face.
