<sup>1</sup> Praise Yah! Blessed is the man, Who fears יהוה, Who has greatly delighted in His commands.

<sup>2</sup> Mighty in the earth shall be his seed, The generation of the straight ones shall be blessed.

<sup>3</sup> Wealth and riches are in his house, And his righteousness is standing forever.

<sup>4</sup> Light has risen in the darkness to the straight ones, Those showing favour, The compassionate, And the righteous.

<sup>5</sup> Good is a man showing favour and lending, He sustains his matters in right-ruling.

<sup>6</sup> For he is never shaken; The righteous is remembered forever.

<sup>7</sup> He is not afraid of an evil report. His heart is steadfast, trusting in יהוה.

<sup>8</sup> His heart is upheld, he is not afraid, While he looks on his adversaries.

<sup>9</sup> He scattered abroad, He gave to the poor, His righteousness is standing forever. His horn is exalted with esteem.

<sup>10</sup> The wrong one sees it and shall be vexed; He gnashes his teeth and shall melt. The desire of the wrong ones does perish.
