<sup>1</sup> Blessed is he who considers the poor; יהוה does deliver him in a day of evil.

<sup>2</sup> יהוה does guard him and keep him alive; He is blessed on the earth, And You do not hand him over To the desire of his enemies.

<sup>3</sup> יהוה sustains him on his sickbed; In his weakness on his bed You bring a change.

<sup>4</sup> As for me, I said, “O יהוה, show me favour; Heal me, for I have sinned against You.”

<sup>5</sup> My enemies speak evil of me, “When he dies his name shall perish.”

<sup>6</sup> And when one comes to visit, he speaks falsely; His heart gathers wickedness to itself; He goes out, he speaks of it.

<sup>7</sup> All who hate me whisper together against me; They plot evil to me, saying,

<sup>8</sup> “A matter of Beliya‛al is poured out on him, That when he lies down, he would not rise again.”

<sup>9</sup> Even my own friend in whom I trusted, who ate my bread, Has lifted up his heel against me.

<sup>10</sup> But You, יהוה, show me favour and raise me up, And let me repay them.

<sup>11</sup> By this I know that You did delight in me, Because my enemy does not shout for joy over me.

<sup>12</sup> And I, You uphold me in my integrity, And set me before Your face forever.

<sup>13</sup> Blessed be יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl From everlasting to everlasting! Amĕn and Amĕn.
