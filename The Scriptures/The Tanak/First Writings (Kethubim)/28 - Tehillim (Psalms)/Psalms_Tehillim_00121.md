<sup>1</sup> I lift up my eyes to the hills; Where does my help come from?

<sup>2</sup> My help comes from יהוה, Maker of the heavens and earth.

<sup>3</sup> He does not allow your foot to be moved; He who watches over you does not slumber.

<sup>4</sup> See, He who is guarding Yisra’ĕl Neither slumbers nor sleeps.

<sup>5</sup> יהוה is your guard; יהוה is your shade at your right hand.

<sup>6</sup> The sun does not strike you by day, Nor the moon by night.

<sup>7</sup> יהוה guards you from all evil; He guards your being.

<sup>8</sup> יהוה guards your going out and your coming in Now and forever.
