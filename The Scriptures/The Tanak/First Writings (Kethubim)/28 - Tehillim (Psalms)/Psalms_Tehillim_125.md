<sup>1</sup> Those who trust in יהוה Are like Mount Tsiyon – It is not shaken, it remains forever.

<sup>2</sup> As the mountains surround Yerushalayim, So יהוה surrounds His people, Now and forever.

<sup>3</sup> For the sceptre of wrongness shall not rest On the land allotted to the righteous, Lest the righteous stretch forth their hands to unrighteousness.

<sup>4</sup> Do good, O יהוה, to those who are good, And to those who are upright in their hearts.

<sup>5</sup> But those who turn aside to their crooked ways, יהוה shall lead them away With the workers of wickedness. Peace be upon Yisra’ĕl!
