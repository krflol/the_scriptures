<sup>1</sup> O Elohim, the gentiles have come into Your inheritance; They have defiled Your set-apart Hĕḵal; They turned Yerushalayim into ruins.

<sup>2</sup> They have given the dead bodies of Your servants As food for the birds of the heavens, The flesh of Your kind ones to the wild beast of the earth.

<sup>3</sup> They have poured out their blood Like water all around Yerushalayim, With no one to bury them.

<sup>4</sup> We have become a reproach to our neighbours, A scorn and a mockery to those who are around us.

<sup>5</sup> How long, O יהוה, Would You be enraged forever? Would Your jealousy burn like fire?

<sup>6</sup> Pour out Your wrath on the gentiles Who have not known You, And on reigns that have not called on Your Name.

<sup>7</sup> For they have devoured Ya‛aqoḇ, And laid waste his pasture.

<sup>8</sup> Do not remember against us The crookednesses of the fathers! Let Your compassion speedily meet us, For we have been greatly weakened.

<sup>9</sup> Help us, O Elohim of our deliverance, For the sake of the esteem of Your Name. And deliver us, and cover over our sins, For Your Name’s sake!

<sup>10</sup> Why should the gentiles say, “Where is their Elohim?” Let the vengeance of the outpoured blood of Your servants Be known among the gentiles, Before our eyes.

<sup>11</sup> Let the groaning of the prisoner come before You. According to the greatness of Your arm Preserve those appointed to death.

<sup>12</sup> And repay to our neighbours sevenfold Their reproach, into their bosom, With which they have reproached You, O יהוה.

<sup>13</sup> And we, Your people and the sheep of Your pasture, We give thanks to You forever; From generation to generation we show forth Your praise.
