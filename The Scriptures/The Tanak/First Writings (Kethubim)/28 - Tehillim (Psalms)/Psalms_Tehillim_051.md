<sup>1</sup> Show me favour, O Elohim, According to Your kindness; According to the greatness of Your compassion, Blot out my transgressions.

<sup>2</sup> Wash me completely from my guilt, And cleanse me from my sin.

<sup>3</sup> For I know my transgressions, And my sin is ever before me.

<sup>4</sup> Against You, You alone, have I sinned, And done evil in Your eyes; That You might be proven right in Your words; Be clear when You judge.

<sup>5</sup> See, I was brought forth in crookedness, And in sin my mother conceived me.

<sup>6</sup> See, You have desired truth in the inward parts, And in the hidden part You make me know wisdom.

<sup>7</sup> Cleanse me with hyssop, and I am clean; Wash me, and I am whiter than snow.

<sup>8</sup> Let me hear joy and gladness, Let the bones You have crushed rejoice.

<sup>9</sup> Hide Your face from my sins, And blot out all my crookednesses.

<sup>10</sup> Create in me a clean heart, O Elohim, And renew a steadfast spirit within me.

<sup>11</sup> Do not cast me away from Your presence, And do not take Your Set-apart Spirit from me.

<sup>12</sup> Restore to me the joy of Your deliverance, And uphold me, Noble Spirit!

<sup>13</sup> Let me teach transgressors Your ways, So that sinners turn back to You.

<sup>14</sup> Deliver me from blood-guilt, O Elohim, Elohim of my deliverance, Let my tongue sing aloud of Your righteousness.

<sup>15</sup> O יהוה, open my lips, And that my mouth declare Your praise.

<sup>16</sup> For You do not desire slaughtering, or I would give it; You do not delight in burnt offering.

<sup>17</sup> The slaughterings of Elohim are a broken spirit, A heart broken and crushed, O Elohim, These You do not despise.

<sup>18</sup> Do good in Your good pleasure to Tsiyon; Build the walls of Yerushalayim.

<sup>19</sup> Then You would delight in slaughterings of righteousness, In burnt offering and complete burnt offering; Then young bulls would be offered on Your altar.
