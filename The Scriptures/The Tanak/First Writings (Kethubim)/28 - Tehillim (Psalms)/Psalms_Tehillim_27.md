<sup>1</sup> יהוה is my light and my deliverance; Whom should I fear? יהוה is the refuge of my life; Whom should I dread?

<sup>2</sup> When evil-doers come against me To eat up my flesh, My adversaries and my enemies, They shall stumble and fall.

<sup>3</sup> Though an army encamps against me, My heart does not fear; Though battle comes up against me, Even then I would be trusting.

<sup>4</sup> One matter I asked of יהוה – this I seek: To dwell in the House of יהוה All the days of my life, To see the pleasantness of יהוה, And to inquire in His Hĕḵal.

<sup>5</sup> For in the day of evil He hides me in His booth; In the covering of His Tent He hides me; On a rock He raises me up.

<sup>6</sup> And now my head is lifted up above my enemies all around me; And I offer in His Tent with shouts of joy; I sing, yea, I sing praises to יהוה.

<sup>7</sup> Hear, O יהוה, when I cry with my voice! And show me favour, and answer me.

<sup>8</sup> To my heart You have said, “Seek My face.” Your face, יהוה, I seek.

<sup>9</sup> Do not hide Your face from me; Do not turn Your servant away in displeasure; You have been my help; Do not leave me nor forsake me, O Elohim of my deliverance.

<sup>10</sup> When my father and my mother have forsaken me, Then יהוה does take me in.

<sup>11</sup> Teach me Your way, O יהוה, And lead me in a smooth path, because of my enemies.

<sup>12</sup> Do not give me over To the desire of my adversaries; For false witnesses have risen against me, And they breathe out cruelty to me.

<sup>13</sup> What if I had not believed To see the goodness of יהוה In the land of the living!

<sup>14</sup> Wait on יהוה, be strong, And let Him strengthen your heart! Wait, I say, on יהוה !
