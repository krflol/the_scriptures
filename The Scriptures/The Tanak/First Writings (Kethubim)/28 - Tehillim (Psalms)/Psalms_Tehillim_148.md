<sup>1</sup> Praise Yah! Praise יהוה from the heavens, Praise Him in the heights!

<sup>2</sup> Praise Him, all His messengers; Praise Him, all His hosts!

<sup>3</sup> Praise Him, sun and moon; Praise Him, all you stars of light!

<sup>4</sup> Praise Him, heavens of heavens, And you waters above the heavens!

<sup>5</sup> Let them praise the Name of יהוה, For He commanded and they were created.

<sup>6</sup> And He established them forever and ever, He gave a law and they pass not beyond.

<sup>7</sup> Praise יהוה from the earth, You great sea creatures and all the depths,

<sup>8</sup> Fire and hail, snow and clouds, Stormy wind that does His word,

<sup>9</sup> The mountains and all hills, Fruit tree and all cedars,

<sup>10</sup> Wild beasts and all cattle, Creeping creatures and flying birds,

<sup>11</sup> Sovereigns of the earth and all peoples, Rulers and all judges of the earth,

<sup>12</sup> Both young men and maidens, Old men and children.

<sup>13</sup> Let them praise the Name of יהוה, For His Name alone is exalted, His splendour is above the earth and heavens.

<sup>14</sup> He also lifts up the horn of His people, The praise of all His kind ones; Of the children of Yisra’ĕl, A people near to Him. Praise Yah!
