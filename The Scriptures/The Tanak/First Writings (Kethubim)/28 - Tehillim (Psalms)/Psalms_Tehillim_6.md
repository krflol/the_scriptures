<sup>1</sup> O יהוה, do not rebuke me in Your displeasure, Nor discipline me in Your wrath.

<sup>2</sup> Show favour to me, O יהוה, for I am fading away; O יהוה, heal me, for my bones have been troubled.

<sup>3</sup> And my being has been greatly troubled; And You, O יהוה – till when?

<sup>4</sup> Return, O יהוה, rescue my life! Oh, save me for Your kindness’ sake!

<sup>5</sup> For in death there is no remembrance of You; Who gives You thanks in the grave?

<sup>6</sup> I have grown weary with my groaning; Every night I flood my bed; I drench my couch with my tears.

<sup>7</sup> My eye has grown dim because of grief; It grows old because of all my adversaries.

<sup>8</sup> Depart from me, all you workers of wickedness; For יהוה has heard the voice of my weeping.

<sup>9</sup> יהוה has heard my pleading; יהוה receives my prayer.

<sup>10</sup> Let all my enemies be ashamed and greatly troubled; They turn back suddenly, ashamed.
