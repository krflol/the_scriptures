<sup>1</sup> Elohim stands in the congregation of Ĕl; He judges in the midst of the elohim.

<sup>2</sup> How long would you judge perversely, And show partiality to the wrong? Selah.

<sup>3</sup> Give right-ruling to the poor and fatherless, Do right to the afflicted and needy.

<sup>4</sup> Rescue the poor and needy; Deliver them from the hand of the wrong.

<sup>5</sup> They do not know, nor do they understand, They walk about in darkness. All the foundations of the earth are shaken.

<sup>6</sup> I, I said, “You are elohim, And all of you are sons of the Most High.

<sup>7</sup> “But as men you die, And fall as one of the heads.”

<sup>8</sup> Arise, O Elohim, judge the earth, For You shall possess all the nations.
