<sup>1</sup> Shout with joy to Elohim, All the earth!

<sup>2</sup> Sing out the splendour of His Name; Make His praise esteemed.

<sup>3</sup> Say to Elohim, “How awesome are Your works! Through the greatness of Your power Your enemies pretend obedience to You.

<sup>4</sup> “All the earth bow to You, They sing praises to You, They praise Your Name.” Selah.

<sup>5</sup> Come and see the works of Elohim, Awesome acts toward the sons of men.

<sup>6</sup> He has turned the sea into dry land, They went through the river on foot. There we rejoiced in Him,

<sup>7</sup> Who rules by His power forever; His eyes keeping watch on the gentiles; Let the rebellious not exalt themselves. Selah.

<sup>8</sup> Bless our Elohim, you peoples! And sound His praise abroad,

<sup>9</sup> Who keeps us in life, And does not allow our feet to be moved.

<sup>10</sup> For You, O Elohim, have proved us; You have refined us as silver is refined.

<sup>11</sup> You brought us into the net; You laid affliction on our loins.

<sup>12</sup> You have let men ride at our head; We went through fire and through water; But You brought us out to plenty.

<sup>13</sup> I enter Your house with burnt offerings; I complete my vows to You,

<sup>14</sup> That which my lips have uttered And my mouth spoke in my distress.

<sup>15</sup> Burnt offerings of fatlings I offer to You, With the incense of rams; I offer bulls with goats. Selah.

<sup>16</sup> Come, hear, all you who fear Elohim, And I relate what He has done for my being.

<sup>17</sup> I called to Him with my mouth, And praise was in my tongue.

<sup>18</sup> If I have seen wickedness in my heart, יהוה would not hear.

<sup>19</sup> Truly, Elohim has heard me; He has given heed to the voice of my prayer.

<sup>20</sup> Blessed be Elohim, Who has not turned away my prayer, Nor His kindness from me!
