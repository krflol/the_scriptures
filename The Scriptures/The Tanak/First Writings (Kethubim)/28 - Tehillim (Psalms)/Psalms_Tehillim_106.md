<sup>1</sup> Praise Yah! Oh, give thanks to יהוה, For He is good! For His kindness is everlasting.

<sup>2</sup> Who does relate the mighty acts of יהוה ? Or declare all His praise?

<sup>3</sup> Blessed are those who guard right-ruling, Who do righteousness at all times!

<sup>4</sup> Remember me, O יהוה, in the acceptance of Your people; Visit me with Your deliverance,

<sup>5</sup> To see the good of Your chosen ones, To rejoice in the gladness of Your nation, To make my boast with Your inheritance.

<sup>6</sup> We have sinned with our fathers, We have acted perversely, We have done wrong.

<sup>7</sup> Our fathers in Mitsrayim did not understand Your wonders; They did not remember Your many kindnesses, But rebelled by the sea, the Sea of Reeds.

<sup>8</sup> But He saved them for His Name’s sake, To make known His might.

<sup>9</sup> And He rebuked the Sea of Reeds, and it dried up; And He led them through the depths, Through a wilderness.

<sup>10</sup> And He saved them from the hand of the hater, And redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.

<sup>11</sup> And waters covered their adversaries; Not one of them was left.

<sup>12</sup> Then they believed His words; They sang His praise.

<sup>13</sup> They soon forgot His works; They did not wait for His counsel,

<sup>14</sup> But greedily lusted in the wilderness, And tried Ĕl in the desert.

<sup>15</sup> And He gave them their request, But sent leanness within their being.

<sup>16</sup> And they were jealous of Mosheh in the camp, Of Aharon, the set-apart one of יהוה,

<sup>17</sup> Then the earth opened up and swallowed Dathan, And covered the company of Aḇiram.

<sup>18</sup> And a fire burned in their company; A flame consumed the wrong.

<sup>19</sup> They made a calf in Ḥorĕḇ, And bowed down to a moulded image.

<sup>20</sup> Thus they changed My esteem Into the form of an ox that eats grass.

<sup>21</sup> They forgot Ĕl their Saviour, The Doer of great deeds in Mitsrayim,

<sup>22</sup> Of wonders in the land of Ḥam, Of awesome deeds by the Sea of Reeds.

<sup>23</sup> Then He said that He would destroy them, Had not Mosheh His chosen one stood before Him in the breach, To turn away His wrath from destroying them.

<sup>24</sup> They then despised the pleasant land; They did not believe His word,

<sup>25</sup> And they grumbled in their tents, They did not listen to the voice of יהוה.

<sup>26</sup> So He lifted up His hand in an oath against them, To make them fall in the wilderness,

<sup>27</sup> And to make their seed fall among the gentiles, And to scatter them in the lands.

<sup>28</sup> And they joined themselves to Ba‛al Pe‛or, And ate slaughterings made to the dead.

<sup>29</sup> Thus they provoked Him with their deeds, And the plague broke out among them.

<sup>30</sup> Then Pineḥas stood up and intervened, And the plague was stopped.

<sup>31</sup> And that was reckoned to him for righteousness To all generations forever.

<sup>32</sup> And they provoked wrath at the waters of Meriḇah, And Mosheh suffered on account of them;

<sup>33</sup> Because they embittered his spirit, And he spoke rashly with his lips.

<sup>34</sup> They did not destroy the peoples, As יהוה had commanded them,

<sup>35</sup> But mixed with the gentiles And learned their works,

<sup>36</sup> And served their idols, And they became a snare to them.

<sup>37</sup> And they slaughtered their sons And their daughters to demons,

<sup>38</sup> And they shed innocent blood, The blood of their sons and daughters, Whom they offered to the idols of Kena‛an; And the land was defiled with blood.

<sup>39</sup> So they became unclean by their own works, And went whoring by their own deeds.

<sup>40</sup> And the wrath of יהוה burned against His people, And He loathed His own inheritance.

<sup>41</sup> Then He gave them into the hand of the gentiles, And those who hated them ruled over them.

<sup>42</sup> And their enemies oppressed them, And they were humbled under their hand.

<sup>43</sup> Many times He delivered them; But they rebelled in their plans, So they were brought low for their crookedness.

<sup>44</sup> But He would look on their distress, When He heard their cry,

<sup>45</sup> And remember His covenant for their sake, And relent according to the greatness of His kindness.

<sup>46</sup> And He would let them find compassion, Before all those holding them captive.

<sup>47</sup> Save us, O יהוה our Elohim, And gather us from among the gentiles, To give thanks to Your set-apart Name, To exult in Your praise.

<sup>48</sup> Blessed be יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl From everlasting to everlasting! And all the people shall say, “Amĕn!” Praise Yah!
