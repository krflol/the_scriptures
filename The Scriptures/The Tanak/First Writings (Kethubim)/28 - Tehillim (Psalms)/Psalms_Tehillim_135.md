<sup>1</sup> Praise Yah! Praise the Name of יהוה ; Praise, you servants of יהוה,

<sup>2</sup> Who are standing in the House of יהוה, In the courts of the House of our Elohim,

<sup>3</sup> Praise Yah, for יהוה is good; Sing praises to His Name, for it is pleasant.

<sup>4</sup> For Yah has chosen Ya‛aqoḇ for Himself, Yisra’ĕl for His treasured possession.

<sup>5</sup> For I know that יהוה is great, And our Master is above all mighty ones.

<sup>6</sup> יהוה has done whatever pleased Him, In the heavens and in earth, In the seas and in all the depths,

<sup>7</sup> Causing vapours to go up From the ends of the earth; He made lightning for the rain, Bringing forth wind from His treasuries;

<sup>8</sup> Who smote the first-born of Mitsrayim, From man to beast.

<sup>9</sup> He sent signs and wonders Into your midst, O Mitsrayim, On Pharaoh and on all his servants;

<sup>10</sup> Who smote many nations, And slew mighty sovereigns,

<sup>11</sup> Even Siḥon sovereign of the Amorites, And Oḡ sovereign of Bashan, And all the reigns of Kena‛an.

<sup>12</sup> And He gave their land as an inheritance, An inheritance to Yisra’ĕl His people.

<sup>13</sup> O יהוה, Your Name is forever, O יהוה, Your remembrance to all generations,

<sup>14</sup> For יהוה rightly rules His people, And has compassion on His servants.

<sup>15</sup> The idols of the gentiles are silver and gold, The work of men’s hands.

<sup>16</sup> They have mouths, but they do not speak; They have eyes, but they do not see;

<sup>17</sup> They have ears, but they do not hear; Also there is no breath in their mouth.

<sup>18</sup> Those making them become like them, Everyone who is trusting in them.

<sup>19</sup> Bless יהוה, O house of Yisra’ĕl! Bless יהוה, O house of Aharon!

<sup>20</sup> Bless יהוה, O house of Lĕwi! You who fear יהוה, bless יהוה !

<sup>21</sup> Blessed from Tsiyon, יהוה be, Who dwells in Yerushalayim! Praise Yah.
