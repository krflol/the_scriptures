<sup>1</sup> In my distress I cried to יהוה, And He answered me.

<sup>2</sup> יהוה, deliver my being from false lips, From a treacherous tongue.

<sup>3</sup> What would one give to you, Or what would one do to you, O treacherous tongue?

<sup>4</sup> Sharp arrows of a mighty man, With coals of the broom-wood!

<sup>5</sup> Woe to me for I have sojourned in Mesheḵ, I have dwelt among the tents of Qĕḏar!

<sup>6</sup> My being has dwelt too long With him who hates peace.

<sup>7</sup> I am for peace; But when I speak, they are for fighting.
