<sup>1</sup> See how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity –

<sup>2</sup> Like the precious oil on the head, Running down on the beard, The beard of Aharon, Running down on the collar of his robes –

<sup>3</sup> Like the dew of Ḥermon, That comes down on the mountains of Tsiyon. For there יהוה commanded the blessing, Life forever!
