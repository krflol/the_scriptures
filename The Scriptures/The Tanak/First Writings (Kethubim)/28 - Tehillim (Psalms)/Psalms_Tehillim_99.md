<sup>1</sup> יהוה shall reign; Peoples tremble! He is enthroned on the keruḇim; The earth shakes!

<sup>2</sup> יהוה is great in Tsiyon, And He is high above all the peoples.

<sup>3</sup> They praise Your Name, great and awesome, It is set-apart.

<sup>4</sup> And the strength of the Sovereign Shall love right-ruling; You Yourself shall establish straightness; You shall execute right-ruling And righteousness in Ya‛aqoḇ.

<sup>5</sup> Exalt יהוה our Elohim, And bow yourselves at His footstool, He is set-apart.

<sup>6</sup> Mosheh and Aharon were among His priests, And Shemu’ĕl was among those calling upon His Name. They called upon יהוה, and He answered them.

<sup>7</sup> He spoke to them in the column of cloud; They guarded His witnesses And the law He gave them.

<sup>8</sup> You answered them, O יהוה our Elohim. You were a forgiving Ĕl to them, Though You took vengeance on their deeds.

<sup>9</sup> Exalt יהוה our Elohim, And bow down towards His set-apart mountain; For יהוה our Elohim is set-apart.
