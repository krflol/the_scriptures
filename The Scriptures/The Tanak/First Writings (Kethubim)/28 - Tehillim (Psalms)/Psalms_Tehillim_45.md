<sup>1</sup> My heart is overflowing with a goodly word; I address my works to the Sovereign; My tongue is the pen of a speedy writer.

<sup>2</sup> You are more handsome than the sons of men; Favour has been poured upon Your lips; Therefore Elohim has blessed You forever.

<sup>3</sup> Gird Your sword upon Your thigh, O Mighty One, Your excellency and Your splendour.

<sup>4</sup> And ride prosperously in Your splendour, On the matter of truth and humility, righteousness; And let Your right hand lead You to awesome matters.

<sup>5</sup> Your arrows are sharp In the heart of the Sovereign’s enemies – Peoples fall under You.

<sup>6</sup> Your throne, O Elohim, is forever and ever; The sceptre of Your reign Is a sceptre of straightness.

<sup>7</sup> You have loved righteousness and hated wrongness; Therefore Elohim, Your Elohim, has anointed You With the oil of gladness more than Your companions.

<sup>8</sup> All Your garments are myrrh and aloes, cassia; Out of the palaces of ivory, Stringed instruments have made You glad.

<sup>9</sup> Daughters of sovereigns are among Your precious ones; At Your right hand stands the sovereigness in gold from Ophir.

<sup>10</sup> Listen, O daughter, and see, And incline your ear, And forget your own people and your father’s house;

<sup>11</sup> And let the Sovereign delight in your loveliness; Because He is your Master – bow yourself to Him.

<sup>12</sup> And the daughter of Tsor with a gift, The rich among the people seek your favour.

<sup>13</sup> The daughter of the Sovereign Is all esteemed within the palace; Her dress is embroidered with gold.

<sup>14</sup> She is brought to the Sovereign in embroidered work; Maidens, her companions following her, Are brought to You.

<sup>15</sup> They are brought with gladness and rejoicing; They enter the Sovereign’s palace.

<sup>16</sup> Instead of Your fathers are Your sons, Whom You appoint princes in all the earth.

<sup>17</sup> I cause Your Name to be remembered in all generations; Therefore the people praise You forever and ever.
