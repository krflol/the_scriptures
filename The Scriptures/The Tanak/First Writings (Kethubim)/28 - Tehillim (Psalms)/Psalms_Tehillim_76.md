<sup>1</sup> In Yehuḏah Elohim is known; His Name is great in Yisra’ĕl.

<sup>2</sup> And His booth is in Shalĕm,

<sup>3</sup> There He broke the arrows of the bow, The shield and the sword and the battle-axe. Selah.

<sup>4</sup> You are resplendent, More excellent than mountains of prey.

<sup>5</sup> The stout-hearted have been stripped; They slept their sleep; And none of the mighty men have found their hands.

<sup>6</sup> At Your rebuke, O Elohim of Ya‛aqoḇ, Both the rider and horse lay stunned.

<sup>7</sup> You, You are to be feared; And who would stand in Your presence When You are displeased?

<sup>8</sup> From heaven You shall cause judgment to be heard; The earth shall fear, and shall be still,

<sup>9</sup> When Elohim arises to right-ruling, To save all the meek of the earth. Selah.

<sup>10</sup> For the wrath of mankind praises You, With the remainder of wrath You gird Yourself!

<sup>11</sup> Make vows to יהוה your Elohim, and pay them. Let all who are around Him bring presents To the One to be feared.

<sup>12</sup> He cuts off the spirit of leaders, He is awesome to the sovereigns of the earth!
