<sup>1</sup> Rule me rightly, O יהוה, For I have walked in my integrity. And I have trusted in יהוה, without wavering.

<sup>2</sup> Examine me, O יהוה, and prove me; Try my kidneys and my heart.

<sup>3</sup> For Your kindness is before my eyes, And I have walked in Your truth.

<sup>4</sup> I have not sat with men of falsehood, Nor do I enter with pretenders.

<sup>5</sup> I have hated the assembly of evil-doers, And I do not sit with the wrong.

<sup>6</sup> I wash my hands in innocence; And I walk around Your altar, O יהוה,

<sup>7</sup> To raise a voice of thanksgiving, And to declare all Your wonders.

<sup>8</sup> יהוה, I have loved the abode of Your house, And the place where Your esteem dwells.

<sup>9</sup> Do not gather my being together with sinners, Nor my life with bloodthirsty men,

<sup>10</sup> In whose hands is a plot, And their right hand is filled with bribes.

<sup>11</sup> But as for me, I walk in my integrity; Redeem me and show me favour.

<sup>12</sup> My foot shall stand on a level place; In the assemblies I bless יהוה.
