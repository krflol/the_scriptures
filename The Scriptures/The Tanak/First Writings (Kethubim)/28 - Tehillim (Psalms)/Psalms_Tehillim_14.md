<sup>1</sup> The fool has said in his heart, “There is no יהוה.” They have done corruptly, They have done an abominable deed, There is no one who does good.

<sup>2</sup> יהוה looked down from the heavens on the sons of mankind, To see if there is a wise one, seeking יהוה.

<sup>3</sup> They have all turned aside, They have together become filthy; No one is doing good, not even one.

<sup>4</sup> Have all the workers of wickedness no knowledge, Who eat up my people as they eat bread, And do not call on יהוה ?

<sup>5</sup> There they are in great fear, For יהוה is with the generation of the righteous.

<sup>6</sup> You would put to shame the counsel of the poor, But יהוה is his refuge.

<sup>7</sup> O that the deliverance of Yisra’ĕl Would be given out of Tsiyon! When יהוה turns back the captivity of His people, Let Ya‛aqoḇ rejoice, let Yisra’ĕl be glad.
