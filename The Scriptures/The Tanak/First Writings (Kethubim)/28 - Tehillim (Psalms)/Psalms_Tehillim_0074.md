<sup>1</sup> O Elohim, why do You forever reject us? Why does Your displeasure smoke Against the sheep of Your pasture?

<sup>2</sup> Remember Your congregation. You did purchase of old, The tribe of Your inheritance. You did redeem, This Mount Tsiyon where You have dwelt.

<sup>3</sup> Lift up Your steps to the endless ruins; The enemy has done all evil in the set-apart place.

<sup>4</sup> Your adversaries have roared In the midst of Your meeting places; They have set up their own signs as signs.

<sup>5</sup> It seems as if one had lifted up Axes among the thick trees.

<sup>6</sup> And now all its carved work, They have broken down with axe and hammer.

<sup>7</sup> They have set fire to Your set-apart place, They have profaned the dwelling place of Your Name to the ground.

<sup>8</sup> They said in their hearts, “Let us suppress them altogether.” They burned all the meeting places of Ĕl in the land.

<sup>9</sup> We do not see our signs, There is no longer a prophet, Nor any among us who knows how long.

<sup>10</sup> O Elohim, how long would the adversary reproach? Would the enemy despise Your Name forever?

<sup>11</sup> Why do You hold back Your hand, even Your right hand? From the midst of Your bosom – end it!

<sup>12</sup> For Elohim is my Sovereign from of old, Working deliverance in the midst of the earth.

<sup>13</sup> You divided the sea by Your might; You broke the heads of the sea serpents in the waters.

<sup>14</sup> You broke the heads of Liwiathan in pieces, You made him food for the people Living in the wilderness.

<sup>15</sup> You did cleave open the fountain and the flood, You did dry up mighty rivers.

<sup>16</sup> The day is Yours, the night is Yours too, You have established the light and the sun.

<sup>17</sup> You have set all the borders of the earth, You have made summer and winter.

<sup>18</sup> Remember this: the enemy has reproached יהוה, And a foolish people has despised Your Name.

<sup>19</sup> Do not give the being of Your turtledove to the wild beast! Do not forget the life of Your afflicted ones forever.

<sup>20</sup> Look to the covenant, For the dark places of the earth are filled With haunts of violence.

<sup>21</sup> Let not the crushed one return ashamed! Let the poor and needy praise Your Name.

<sup>22</sup> Arise, O Elohim, plead Your own cause, Remember how the foolish man reproaches You daily.

<sup>23</sup> Do not forget the voice of Your enemies, The uproar of those rising up against You increases continually.
