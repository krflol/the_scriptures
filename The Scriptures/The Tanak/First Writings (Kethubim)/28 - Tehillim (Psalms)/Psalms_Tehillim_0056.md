<sup>1</sup> Show me favour, O Elohim, For man would swallow me up; Fighting all day long, he oppresses me.

<sup>2</sup> My enemies would swallow me up all day long, For many are fighting against me, O Most High.

<sup>3</sup> In the day I am afraid, I trust in You.

<sup>4</sup> In Elohim, whose Word I praise, In Elohim I have trusted; I do not fear; What could flesh do to me?

<sup>5</sup> All day long they twist my words; All their thoughts are against me for evil.

<sup>6</sup> They stir up strife, they hide, They watch my steps, As they lie in wait for my life.

<sup>7</sup> Because of wickedness, cast them out. Put down the peoples in displeasure, O Elohim!

<sup>8</sup> You have counted my wanderings; You put my tears into Your bottle; Are they not in Your book?

<sup>9</sup> My enemies turn back in the day I call; This I know, because Elohim is for me.

<sup>10</sup> In Elohim, whose Word I praise, In יהוה, whose Word I praise,

<sup>11</sup> In Elohim I have trusted; I do not fear; What could man do to me?

<sup>12</sup> On me, O Elohim, are Your vows; I render praises to You,

<sup>13</sup> For You have delivered my life from death, My feet from stumbling, That I might walk before Elohim, In the light of the living!
