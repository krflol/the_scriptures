<sup>1</sup> I shall lift up my eyes Unto You who dwell in the heavens.

<sup>2</sup> See, as the eyes of servants Are toward the hand of their masters, As the eyes of a female servant Are toward the hand of her mistress, So are our eyes toward יהוה our Elohim, Until He shows favour to us.

<sup>3</sup> Show favour to us, O יהוה, show favour to us! For we are exceedingly filled with mockery.

<sup>4</sup> Our being is exceedingly filled With the scoffing of those who are at ease, With the mockery of the proud.
