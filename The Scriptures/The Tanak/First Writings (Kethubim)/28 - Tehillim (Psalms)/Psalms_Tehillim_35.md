<sup>1</sup> O יהוה, strive with those who strive with me; Fight against those who fight against me.

<sup>2</sup> Take hold of shield and armour, And rise for my help.

<sup>3</sup> And draw out spear and lance, To meet those who pursue me. Say to my life, “I am your deliverance.”

<sup>4</sup> Let those be ashamed and blush Who seek my life; Let those be turned back and abashed Who plot evil to me.

<sup>5</sup> Let them be as chaff before the wind, With a messenger of יהוה driving on.

<sup>6</sup> Let their way be dark and slippery, With a messenger of יהוה pursuing them.

<sup>7</sup> For without cause they hid their net for me; Without cause they dug a pit for my life.

<sup>8</sup> Let ruin come upon him unawares, And let his net that he hid catch himself; Let him fall in it, into ruin.

<sup>9</sup> But let my own being exult in יהוה ; Let it rejoice in His deliverance.

<sup>10</sup> Let all my bones say, “ יהוה, who is like You, Delivering the poor from one stronger than he, And the poor and the needy from him who robs him?”

<sup>11</sup> Ruthless witnesses rise up; They ask me that which I knew not.

<sup>12</sup> They reward me evil for good, bereaving my life.

<sup>13</sup> But I, when they were sick, I put on sackcloth; I humbled my being with fastings; And my prayer would return to my own bosom.

<sup>14</sup> I walked about as though he were my friend or brother; I bowed down mourning, as one mourning for a mother.

<sup>15</sup> But they rejoiced at my stumbling And gathered together; The smiters gathered against me, And I did not know it; They tore in pieces without ceasing,

<sup>16</sup> With unclean ones, mockers at feasts, Gnashing at me with their teeth.

<sup>17</sup> יהוה, how long would You look on? Rescue my being from their destructions, My only life from the lions.

<sup>18</sup> I give You thanks in the great assembly; I praise You among a mighty people.

<sup>19</sup> Let not my lying enemies rejoice over me; Or those who hate me without cause wink their eyes.

<sup>20</sup> For they do not speak peace, But they devise words of deceit Against the peaceable ones of the land.

<sup>21</sup> And they open their mouth wide against me, They said, “Aha, aha! Our eyes have seen it.”

<sup>22</sup> This You have seen, O יהוה ; Do not be silent. O יהוה, do not be far from me.

<sup>23</sup> Stir up Yourself and awake to my right-ruling – To my cause, my Elohim and my Master.

<sup>24</sup> Rule me rightly, O יהוה my Elohim, According to Your righteousness; And let them not rejoice over me.

<sup>25</sup> Let them not say in their hearts, “Aha, our desire!” Let them not say, “We have swallowed him up.”

<sup>26</sup> Let those who are rejoicing at my evil Be ashamed and abashed altogether; Let those who are exalting themselves over me Be clad in shame and humiliation.

<sup>27</sup> Let those who delight in my righteous cause Shout for joy and be glad, And let them always say, “Let יהוה be made great, Who is desiring the peace of His servant.”

<sup>28</sup> And my tongue shall speak of Your righteousness, Your praise, All day long.

<sup>1</sup> O יהוה, strive with those who strive with me; Fight against those who fight against me.

<sup>2</sup> Take hold of shield and armour, And rise for my help.
