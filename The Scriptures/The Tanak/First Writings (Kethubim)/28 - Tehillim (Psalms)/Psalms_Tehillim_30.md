<sup>1</sup> I exalt You, O יהוה, for You have drawn me up, And have not let my enemies rejoice over me.

<sup>2</sup> יהוה my Elohim, I have cried to You, And You have healed me.

<sup>3</sup> יהוה, You brought me up from the grave; You have kept me alive, from going down into the pit.

<sup>4</sup> Sing praise to יהוה, You kind ones of His, And give thanks at the remembrance of His Set-apartness.

<sup>5</sup> For His displeasure is for a moment, His delight is for life; Weeping might last for the night, But joy comes in the morning.

<sup>6</sup> As for me, I have said in my ease, “Never would I be shaken!”

<sup>7</sup> יהוה, in Your good pleasure You have made my mountain to stand strong; You hid Your face, and I was troubled.

<sup>8</sup> I cried out to You, O יהוה ; And to יהוה I prayed:

<sup>9</sup> “What gain is there in my blood, When I go down to the pit? Would dust praise You? Would it declare Your truth?

<sup>10</sup> “Hear, O יהוה, and show me favour; יהוה, be my helper!”

<sup>11</sup> You have turned my mourning into dancing for me; You have torn off my sackcloth and girded me with gladness,

<sup>12</sup> So that esteem might praise You and not be silent. O יהוה my Elohim, I thank You forever.
