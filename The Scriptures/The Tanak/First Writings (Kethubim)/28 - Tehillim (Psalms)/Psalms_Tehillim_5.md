<sup>1</sup> Give ear to my words, O יהוה, Consider my meditation.

<sup>2</sup> Attend to the voice of my cry, My Sovereign and my Elohim, For unto You I pray.

<sup>3</sup> O יהוה, in the morning You hear my voice; I present myself to You in the morning, And I look up.

<sup>4</sup> For You are not an Ĕl taking delight in wrong, Nor does evil dwell with You.

<sup>5</sup> The boasters do not stand before Your eyes; You hate all workers of wickedness.

<sup>6</sup> You destroy those speaking falsehood; יהוה loathes a man of blood and deceit.

<sup>7</sup> But I, I enter Your house In the greatness of Your kindness; I bow myself toward Your set-apart Hĕḵal in Your fear.

<sup>8</sup> O יהוה, lead me in Your righteousness because of those watching me; Make Your way straight before my face.

<sup>9</sup> For there is no stability in their mouth; Their inward part is destruction; Their throat is an open grave; They flatter with their tongue.

<sup>10</sup> Declare them guilty, O Elohim! Let them fall by their own counsels; Thrust them away for their many transgressions, Because they have rebelled against You.

<sup>11</sup> But let all who take refuge in You rejoice; Let them ever shout for joy, because You shelter them; And let those who love Your Name exult in You.

<sup>12</sup> For You bless the righteous, O יהוה ; You surround him with favour as with a shield.
