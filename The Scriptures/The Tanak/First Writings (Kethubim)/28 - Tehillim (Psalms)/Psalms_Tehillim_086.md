<sup>1</sup> Incline Your ear, O יהוה, Answer me, for I am poor and needy.

<sup>2</sup> Guard my being, for I am dedicated; You are my Elohim; Save Your servant who is trusting in You!

<sup>3</sup> Show favour to me, O יהוה, For I cry to You all day long.

<sup>4</sup> Bring joy to the being of Your servant, For to You, O יהוה, I lift up my being.

<sup>5</sup> For You, יהוה, are good, and ready to forgive, And great in kindness to all those who call upon You.

<sup>6</sup> Give ear, O יהוה, to my prayer; And listen to the voice of my pleadings.

<sup>7</sup> In the day of my distress I call upon You, For You answer me.

<sup>8</sup> There is none like You among the mighty ones, O יהוה ; And like Your works there are none.

<sup>9</sup> Let all nations You have made Come and bow themselves before You, O יהוה, And give esteem to Your Name.

<sup>10</sup> For You are great, and are doing wonders; You are Elohim, You alone.

<sup>11</sup> Teach me Your way, O יהוה ; Let me walk in Your truth; Unite my heart to fear Your Name.

<sup>12</sup> I praise You, O יהוה my Elohim, with all my heart, And I esteem Your Name forever.

<sup>13</sup> For Your kindness is great toward me, And You have delivered my being From the depths of the grave.

<sup>14</sup> O Elohim, the proud have risen against me, And a band of dreaded men have sought my life, And have not set You before them.

<sup>15</sup> But You, O יהוה, Are a compassionate Ĕl and showing favour, Patient and great in kindness and truth.

<sup>16</sup> Turn to me, and show favour to me! Give Your strength to Your servant, And save the son of Your female servant.

<sup>17</sup> Show me a sign for good, And let those hating me see it and be ashamed, For You, יהוה, have helped me and comforted me.
