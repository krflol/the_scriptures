<sup>1</sup> The earth belongs to יהוה, And all that fills it – The world and those who dwell in it.

<sup>2</sup> For He has founded it upon the seas, And upon the waters He does establish it.

<sup>3</sup> Who does go up into the mountain of יהוה ? And who does stand in His set-apart place?

<sup>4</sup> He who has innocent hands and a clean heart, Who did not bring his life to naught, And did not swear deceivingly.

<sup>5</sup> He receives a blessing from יהוה, And righteousness from the Elohim of his deliverance.

<sup>6</sup> This is the generation of those who seek Him; Ya‛aqoḇ, who seek Your face. Selah.

<sup>7</sup> Lift up your heads, O you gates! And be lifted up, you everlasting doors! And let the Sovereign of esteem come in.

<sup>8</sup> Who is this Sovereign of esteem? יהוה strong and mighty, יהוה mighty in battle.

<sup>9</sup> Lift up your heads, O you gates! Even lift up, you everlasting doors! And let the Sovereign of esteem come in.

<sup>10</sup> Who is this Sovereign of esteem? יהוה of hosts, He is the Sovereign of esteem! Selah.
