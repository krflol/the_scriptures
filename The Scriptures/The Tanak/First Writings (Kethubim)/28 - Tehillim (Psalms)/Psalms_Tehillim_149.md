<sup>1</sup> Praise Yah! Sing to יהוה a new song, His praise in an assembly of kind ones.

<sup>2</sup> Let Yisra’ĕl rejoice in their Maker; Let the children of Tsiyon exult in their Sovereign.

<sup>3</sup> Let them praise His Name in a dance; Let them sing praises to Him with the tambourine and lyre.

<sup>4</sup> For יהוה takes pleasure in His people; He embellishes the meek ones with deliverance.

<sup>5</sup> Let the kind ones exult in esteem; Let them sing aloud on their beds.

<sup>6</sup> Let the exaltation of Ĕl be in their mouth, And a two-edged sword in their hand,

<sup>7</sup> To execute vengeance on the gentiles, Punishments on the peoples;

<sup>8</sup> To bind their sovereigns with chains, And their nobles with iron bands;

<sup>9</sup> To execute on them the written right-ruling; A splendour it is for all His kind ones. Praise Yah!
