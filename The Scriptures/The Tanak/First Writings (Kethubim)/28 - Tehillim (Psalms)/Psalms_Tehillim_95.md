<sup>1</sup> Come, let us sing to יהוה ! Let us raise a shout to the Rock of our deliverance.

<sup>2</sup> Let us come before His face with thanksgiving; Let us raise a shout to Him in song.

<sup>3</sup> For יהוה is a great Ĕl, And a great Sovereign above all mighty ones.

<sup>4</sup> In whose hand are the depths of the earth; The mountain peaks are His also.

<sup>5</sup> His is the sea, for He made it; And His hands formed the dry land.

<sup>6</sup> Come, let us bow down and bend low, Let us kneel before יהוה our Maker.

<sup>7</sup> For He is our Elohim, And we are the people of His pasture, And the sheep of His hand. Today, if you would hear His voice:

<sup>8</sup> “Do not harden your hearts as in Meriḇah, And as in the day of Massah in the wilderness,

<sup>9</sup> “When your fathers tried Me, Have proved Me, though they saw My work.

<sup>10</sup> “For forty years I was grieved with that generation, And said, ‘They are a people who go astray in their hearts, And they do not know My ways.’

<sup>11</sup> “As I swore in My wrath, ‘If they enter into My rest...’ ”
