<sup>1</sup> I waited, waited for יהוה ; And He inclined to me, and heard my cry.

<sup>2</sup> And He drew me Out of the pit of destruction, Out of the muddy clay, And He set my feet upon a rock, He is establishing my steps.

<sup>3</sup> Then He put a new song in my mouth; Praise to our Elohim; Many do see it and fear, And trust in יהוה.

<sup>4</sup> Blessed is that man who has made יהוה his trust, And has not turned to the proud, And those turning aside to falsehood.

<sup>5</sup> O יהוה my Elohim, many are the wonders Which You have done, and Your purposes toward us; There is no one to compare with You; I declare and speak: They are too many to be numbered.

<sup>6</sup> Slaughtering and meal offering You did not desire; You have opened my ears; Burnt offering and sin offering You did not ask for.

<sup>7</sup> Then I said, “See, I have come; In the scroll of the Book it is prescribed for me.

<sup>8</sup> I have delighted to do Your pleasure, O my Elohim, And Your Torah is within my heart.”

<sup>9</sup> I have proclaimed the good news of righteousness, In the great assembly; See, I do not restrain my lips, O יהוה, You know.

<sup>10</sup> I did not conceal Your righteousness within my heart; I have declared Your trustworthiness and Your deliverance; I did not hide Your kindness and Your truth From the great assembly.

<sup>11</sup> Do not withhold Your compassion from me, O יהוה ; Let Your kindness and Your truth always watch over me.

<sup>12</sup> For evils without number have surrounded me; My crookednesses have overtaken me, And I have been unable to see; They became more than the hairs of my head; And my heart has failed me.

<sup>13</sup> Be pleased, O יהוה, to deliver me; O יהוה, hasten to help me!

<sup>14</sup> Let those who seek to destroy my life Be ashamed and abashed altogether; Let those who are desiring my evil Be driven back and put to shame.

<sup>15</sup> Let those who say to me, “Aha, aha!” Be appalled at their own shame.

<sup>16</sup> Let all those who seek You Rejoice and be glad in You; Let those who love Your deliverance always say, “ יהוה be exalted!”

<sup>17</sup> But I am poor and needy; Let יהוה think upon me. You are my help and my deliverer; O my Elohim, do not delay!
