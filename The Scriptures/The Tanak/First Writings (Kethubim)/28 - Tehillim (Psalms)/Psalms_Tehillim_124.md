<sup>1</sup> “If it had not been יהוה who was on our side,” Let Yisra’ĕl now say;

<sup>2</sup> “If it had not been יהוה who was on our side, When men rose up against us,

<sup>3</sup> “Then they would have swallowed us alive, In their burning rage against us;

<sup>4</sup> “Then the waters would have overwhelmed us, The stream would have gone over our being;

<sup>5</sup> “Then the proud waters Would have gone over our being.”

<sup>6</sup> Blessed be יהוה, Who did not give us as prey to their teeth.

<sup>7</sup> Our being has escaped like a bird From the snare of the trappers; The snare was broken, and we have escaped.

<sup>8</sup> Our help is in the Name of יהוה, Maker of the heavens and earth.
