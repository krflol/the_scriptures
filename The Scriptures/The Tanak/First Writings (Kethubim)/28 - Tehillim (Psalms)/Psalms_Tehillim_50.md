<sup>1</sup> Ĕl Elohim יהוה shall speak, And He shall call the earth From the rising of the sun to its going down.

<sup>2</sup> From Tsiyon, the perfection of loveliness, Elohim shall shine forth.

<sup>3</sup> Our Elohim comes, and is not silent – A fire consumes before Him, And it shall be very stormy all around Him.

<sup>4</sup> He calls to the heavens from above, And to the earth, to rightly rule His people:

<sup>5</sup> “Gather My kind ones together to Me, Those who have made a covenant with Me by slaughtering.”

<sup>6</sup> Then the heavens declared His righteousness, For Elohim Himself is Judge. Selah.

<sup>7</sup> “Hear, O My people, and I speak, O Yisra’ĕl, and I witness against you: I am Elohim, your Elohim!

<sup>8</sup> “I do not reprove you for your slaughterings, And your burnt offerings are continually before Me.

<sup>9</sup> “I do not take a bull from your house, Nor goats out of your pens.

<sup>10</sup> “For every beast of the forest is Mine, The cattle on a thousand hills.

<sup>11</sup> “I know all the birds of the mountains, And all moving in My field are Mine.

<sup>12</sup> “If I were hungry, I would not speak to you; For the world is Mine, and all that fills it.

<sup>13</sup> “Do I eat the flesh of bulls, Or drink the blood of goats?

<sup>14</sup> “Offer thanksgiving to Elohim, And pay your vows to the Most High.

<sup>15</sup> “And call upon Me in the day of distress – Let Me rescue you, and you esteem Me.”

<sup>16</sup> But to the wrong Elohim said, “What right have you to recite My laws, Or take My covenant in your mouth,

<sup>17</sup> “While you hated instruction And cast My Words behind you?

<sup>18</sup> “When you saw a thief, you were pleased with him, And you take part with adulterers.

<sup>19</sup> “You let your mouth loose to evil, And your tongue frames deceit.

<sup>20</sup> “You sit, speak against your brother; You slander your own mother’s son.

<sup>21</sup> “You have done this, and I kept silent; You have thought that I was altogether like you – I rebuke you, and set it in order before your eyes.

<sup>22</sup> “Understand this please, you who forget Eloah, Lest I tear you in pieces, With no one to deliver:

<sup>23</sup> “Whoever offers praise esteems Me; And to him who prepares a way, I show the deliverance of Elohim.”
