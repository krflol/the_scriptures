<sup>1</sup> Show me favour, O Elohim, show me favour! For in You my being is taking refuge; And in the shadow of Your wings I take refuge, Until destruction passes by.

<sup>2</sup> I cry out to the Most High Elohim, To Ĕl who is perfecting all matters for me.

<sup>3</sup> He sends from the heavens and saves me; He reproaches the one who would swallow me up. Selah. Elohim sends forth His kindness and His truth.

<sup>4</sup> My being is in the midst of lions; I lie among those who breathe fire, Whose teeth are spears and arrows, And their tongue is a sharp sword.

<sup>5</sup> Be exalted, O Elohim, above the heavens; Let Your esteem be above all the earth.

<sup>6</sup> They have prepared a net for my footsteps; My being was bowed down; They have dug a pit before me; They fell into the midst of it! Selah.

<sup>7</sup> My heart is firm, O Elohim, My heart is firm; I sing and praise.

<sup>8</sup> Awake, my esteem! Awake, harp and lyre! I awake the dawn.

<sup>9</sup> I praise You among the peoples, O יהוה ; I sing to You among the nations.

<sup>10</sup> For Your kindness is great up to the heavens, And Your truth unto the clouds.

<sup>11</sup> Be exalted above the heavens, O Elohim; Let Your esteem be above all the earth.
