<sup>1</sup> I bless יהוה at all times; His praise is continually in my mouth.

<sup>2</sup> My being makes its boast in יהוה ; Let the humble hear and be glad.

<sup>3</sup> Oh, make יהוה great with me, And let us exalt His Name together.

<sup>4</sup> I sought יהוה, and He answered me, And delivered me from all my fears.

<sup>5</sup> They looked to Him and were lightened, And their faces were not ashamed.

<sup>6</sup> This poor one cried out and יהוה heard him, And saved him out of all his distresses.

<sup>7</sup> The messenger of יהוה encamps all around those who fear Him, And rescues them.

<sup>8</sup> Oh, taste and see that יהוה is good; Blessed is the man that takes refuge in Him!

<sup>9</sup> Fear יהוה, you His set-apart ones, For there is no lack to them who fear Him!

<sup>10</sup> Young lions have lacked and been hungry; But those who seek יהוה lack not any good matter.

<sup>11</sup> Come, you children, listen to me; Let me teach you the fear of יהוה.

<sup>12</sup> Who is the man who desires life, Who loves many days, in order to see good?

<sup>13</sup> Keep your tongue from evil, And your lips from speaking deceit.

<sup>14</sup> Turn away from evil and do good; Seek peace, and pursue it.

<sup>15</sup> The eyes of יהוה are on the righteous, And His ears unto their cry.

<sup>16</sup> The face of יהוה is against evil-doers, To cut off their remembrance from the earth.

<sup>17</sup> The righteous cried out, and יהוה heard, And delivered them out of all their distresses.

<sup>18</sup> יהוה is near to the broken-hearted, And saves those whose spirit is crushed.

<sup>19</sup> Many are the evils of the righteous, But יהוה delivers him out of them all.

<sup>20</sup> He is guarding all his bones; Not one of them is broken.

<sup>21</sup> Evil does slay the wrong, And those who hate the righteous are guilty.

<sup>22</sup> יהוה redeems the lives of His servants, And none of those taking refuge in Him are guilty.
