<sup>1</sup> Hear my voice, O Elohim, in my meditation; Guard my life from the threats of the enemy.

<sup>2</sup> Hide me from the secret plans of the evil-doers, From the tumult of the workers of wickedness,

<sup>3</sup> Who sharpen their tongue like a sword, And aim their arrows, a bitter word,

<sup>4</sup> To shoot in ambush at someone blameless, They shoot at him suddenly and do not fear.

<sup>5</sup> They arm themselves with an evil word; They talk of hiding snares; They have said, “Who sees them?”

<sup>6</sup> They search out unrighteousnesses, “We have perfected a well searched out plan.” For the inward part of man, and heart, are deep.

<sup>7</sup> But Elohim does shoot at them with an arrow; Their wounds shall be sudden.

<sup>8</sup> And they cause one to stumble, Their own tongue is against them; All who see them flee away.

<sup>9</sup> And all men fear, And declare the work of Elohim. And they shall wisely consider What He has done.

<sup>10</sup> The righteous rejoice in יהוה, And shall take refuge in Him, And all the upright in heart praise Him.
