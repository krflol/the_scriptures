<sup>1</sup> Give ear to my prayer, O Elohim, And do not hide Yourself from my plea.

<sup>2</sup> Give heed to me, and answer me; I wander and moan in my complaint,

<sup>3</sup> Because of the noise of the enemy, Because of the outcry of the wrong; For they bring down wickedness upon me, And in wrath they hate me.

<sup>4</sup> My heart is pained within me, And the frights of death have fallen upon me.

<sup>5</sup> Fear and trembling have come upon me, And shuddering covers me.

<sup>6</sup> And I said, “Who would give me wings like a dove! I would fly away and be at rest.

<sup>7</sup> “See, I would wander far off, I would lodge in the wilderness. Selah.

<sup>8</sup> “I would hasten my escape From the raging wind and storm.”

<sup>9</sup> Confuse, O יהוה, divide their tongues, For I saw violence and strife in the city.

<sup>10</sup> Day and night they go around it on its walls; Wickedness and trouble are also in the midst of it.

<sup>11</sup> Covetings are in its midst; Oppression and deceit do not vanish from its streets.

<sup>12</sup> It is not an enemy who reproaches me – That I could bear; Nor one who hates me who is making himself great against me – Then I could hide from him.

<sup>13</sup> But it was you, a man my equal, My companion and my friend.

<sup>14</sup> We took sweet counsel together, We walked to the House of Elohim in the throng.

<sup>15</sup> Let death come upon them; Let them go down into the grave alive, For evil is in their dwellings, in their midst.

<sup>16</sup> I, I call upon Elohim, And יהוה saves me.

<sup>17</sup> Evening and morning and at noon I complain and moan, And He hears my voice.

<sup>18</sup> He has redeemed my life in peace From the battle against me, For there were many against me.

<sup>19</sup> Ĕl, even He who sits enthroned from of old, Does hear and afflict them – Selah – Those with whom there are no changes, Those who do not fear Elohim.

<sup>20</sup> He has put forth his hands against those Who were at peace with him; He has broken his covenant.

<sup>21</sup> His mouth was smoother than curds, Yet in his heart is fighting; His words were softer than oil, But they are drawn swords.

<sup>22</sup> Cast your burden on יהוה, And let Him sustain you; He never allows the righteous to be shaken.

<sup>23</sup> For You, O Elohim, do bring them down To the pit of destruction; Men of blood and deceit do not reach half their days; But I, I trust in You.
