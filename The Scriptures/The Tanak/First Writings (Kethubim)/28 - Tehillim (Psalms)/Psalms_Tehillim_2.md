<sup>1</sup> Why do the gentiles rage, And the peoples meditate emptiness?

<sup>2</sup> The sovereigns of the earth take their stand, And the rulers take counsel together, Against יהוה and against His Messiah, and say,

<sup>3</sup> “Let us tear apart Their bonds, And throw away Their ropes from us.”

<sup>4</sup> He who is sitting in the heavens laughs, יהוה mocks at them.

<sup>5</sup> Then He speaks to them in His wrath, And troubles them in His rage, saying,

<sup>6</sup> “But I, I have set My Sovereign on Tsiyon, My set-apart mountain.”

<sup>7</sup> “I inscribe for a law: יהוה has said to Me, ‘You are My Son, Today I have brought You forth.

<sup>8</sup> ‘Ask of Me, and I make the gentiles Your inheritance, And the ends of the earth Your possession.

<sup>9</sup> ‘Break them with a rod of iron, Dash them to pieces like a potter’s vessel.’ ”

<sup>10</sup> And now, be wise, O sovereigns; Be instructed, you rulers of the earth.

<sup>11</sup> Serve יהוה with fear, And rejoice with trembling.

<sup>12</sup> Kiss the Son, lest He be enraged, And you perish in the way, For soon His wrath is to be kindled. Blessed are all those taking refuge in Him.
