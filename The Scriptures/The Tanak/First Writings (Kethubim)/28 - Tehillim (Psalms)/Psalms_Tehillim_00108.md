<sup>1</sup> O Elohim, my heart is steadfast; I sing and give praise – even my esteem.

<sup>2</sup> Awake, harp and lyre! I awake the dawn.

<sup>3</sup> I praise You, O יהוה, among peoples, And I sing praises to You among the nations.

<sup>4</sup> For Your kindness is great above the heavens, And Your truth reaches to the clouds.

<sup>5</sup> Exalt Yourself above the heavens, O Elohim, And Your esteem above all the earth;

<sup>6</sup> In order that those You love Might be delivered. Save with Your right hand, And answer me.

<sup>7</sup> Elohim has spoken in His set-apartness, “I exult, I portion out Sheḵem, And I measure out the Valley of Sukkoth.

<sup>8</sup> “Gil‛aḏ is Mine, Menashsheh is Mine, And Ephrayim is My chief defence, Yehuḏah is My lawgiver.

<sup>9</sup> “Mo’aḇ is My wash-pot, Over Eḏom I cast My shoe, Over Philistia I raise a shout.”

<sup>10</sup> Who would bring me into the strong city? Who shall lead me to Eḏom?

<sup>11</sup> Have You not rejected us, O Elohim? And You do not go out with our armies, O Elohim!

<sup>12</sup> Give us help from distress, For the help of man is naught.

<sup>13</sup> In Elohim we do mightily, For it is He who treads down our adversaries.
