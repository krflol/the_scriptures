<sup>1</sup> O יהוה, do not rebuke me in Your wrath, Nor chastise me in Your hot displeasure!

<sup>2</sup> For Your arrows have pierced me, And Your hand comes down on me.

<sup>3</sup> There is no soundness in my flesh because of Your rage, Nor peace in my bones because of my sin.

<sup>4</sup> For my crookednesses have passed over my head; Like a heavy burden, too heavy for me.

<sup>5</sup> My wounds have become stinky, festering Because of my folly.

<sup>6</sup> I have been bent down; I have been bowed down very much; All day long I have gone mourning.

<sup>7</sup> For my loins have become filled with burning, And there is no soundness in my flesh.

<sup>8</sup> I have become weak and greatly crushed; I howled from the groaning of my heart.

<sup>9</sup> יהוה, all my desire is before You; And my sighing has not been hid from You.

<sup>10</sup> My heart is throbbing, my strength has forsaken me; And the light of my eyes also is not with me.

<sup>11</sup> My loved ones and my friends stand back from my plague, And my neighbours stand far away.

<sup>12</sup> And those seeking my life lay a snare; And those seeking my evil have spoken of destruction, And utter deceit all day long.

<sup>13</sup> But I, as one deaf, do not hear; And as a dumb one who does not open his mouth.

<sup>14</sup> I am like a man who does not hear, And who has no rebukes in his mouth.

<sup>15</sup> For on You, O יהוה, I have waited; You do answer, O יהוה my Elohim.

<sup>16</sup> For I said, “Otherwise they would rejoice over me, When my foot slips they would exalt themselves over me.”

<sup>17</sup> For I am ready to fall, And my pain is always with me.

<sup>18</sup> For I confess my crookedness; I am sorry over my sin.

<sup>19</sup> But my enemies are alive; They have become strong; And those hating me falsely are many.

<sup>20</sup> And those who repay evil for good, They oppose me, because I follow what is good.

<sup>21</sup> Do not forsake me, O יהוה ; O my Elohim, be not far from me!

<sup>22</sup> Hasten to help me, O יהוה, my deliverance!

<sup>1</sup> O יהוה, do not rebuke me in Your wrath, Nor chastise me in Your hot displeasure!

<sup>2</sup> For Your arrows have pierced me, And Your hand comes down on me.

<sup>3</sup> There is no soundness in my flesh because of Your rage, Nor peace in my bones because of my sin.
