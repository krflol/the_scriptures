<sup>1</sup> Send out your bread on the face of the waters, for after many days you shall find it.

<sup>2</sup> Give a portion to seven, and also to eight, for you do not know what evil might be on the earth.

<sup>3</sup> If the clouds are filled with rain, they empty themselves upon the earth. And if a tree falls to the south or the north, in the place where the tree falls, there it is.

<sup>4</sup> He who watches the wind does not sow, and he who looks at the clouds does not reap.

<sup>5</sup> As you do not know what is the way of the wind, or how the bones grow in the womb of her who is with child, so you do not know the works of Elohim who makes all.

<sup>6</sup> Sow your seed in the morning, and until evening do not let your hand rest; since you do not know which prosper, this or that, or whether both alike are good.

<sup>7</sup> Sweet also is the light, and good for the eyes to see the sun;

<sup>8</sup> But if a man lives many years, let him rejoice in them all. But let him remember the days of darkness, for they are many. All that is coming is futility.

<sup>9</sup> Rejoice, O young man, in your youth, and let your heart gladden you in the days of your youth. And walk in the ways of your heart, and in the sight of your eyes, but know that for all these Elohim brings you into right-ruling.

<sup>10</sup> Therefore remove vexation from your heart, and put away evil from your flesh, for youth and dawn of life are futility.
