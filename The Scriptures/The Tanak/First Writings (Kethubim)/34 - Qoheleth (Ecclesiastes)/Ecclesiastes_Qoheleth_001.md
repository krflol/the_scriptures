<sup>1</sup> The words of Qoheleth, son of Dawiḏ, sovereign in Yerushalayim.

<sup>2</sup> “Futility! Futility!” says Qoheleth. “Futility, futility, all is futile!”

<sup>3</sup> What does man gain from all his labour in which he toils under the sun?

<sup>4</sup> A generation passes away, and a generation comes, but the earth stands forever.

<sup>5</sup> The sun also rises, and the sun sets, and hurries back to the place where it arose.

<sup>6</sup> Going to the south, and turning round to the north, turning, turning, and on its rounds the wind returns.

<sup>7</sup> All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea never overflows. To the place from which the rivers come, there they return again.

<sup>8</sup> All matters are wearisome, no one is able to speak of it. The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.

<sup>9</sup> What has been is what shall be, what has been done is what shall be done, and there is no new matter under the sun.

<sup>10</sup> Is there a matter of which it is said, “See, this is new”? It was here already, long ago.

<sup>11</sup> There is no remembrance of former ones, nor is there any remembrance of those that are to come by those who come later on.

<sup>12</sup> I, Qoheleth, was sovereign over Yisra’ĕl in Yerushalayim.

<sup>13</sup> And I set my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all that has been done under the heavens; this evil task Elohim has given to the sons of man, to be humbled by it.

<sup>14</sup> I have seen all the works that are done under the sun. And see, all was futile and feeding on wind.

<sup>15</sup> The crooked could not be straightened, and what is lacking could not be counted.

<sup>16</sup> So I spoke to my heart, saying, “See, I have attained greatness, and have gained more wisdom than all who were before me in Yerushalayim. And my heart has seen much wisdom and knowledge.”

<sup>17</sup> And I set my heart to know wisdom – and to know madness and folly. I know that this too is feeding on wind.

<sup>18</sup> For in much wisdom is much grief, and he who increases knowledge increases suffering.
