<sup>1</sup> For every matter there is an appointed time, even a time for every pursuit under the heavens:

<sup>2</sup> A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to uproot;

<sup>3</sup> a time to slay, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;

<sup>4</sup> a time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;

<sup>5</sup> a time to throw away stones, and a time to gather stones; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;

<sup>6</sup> a time to seek, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to throw away;

<sup>7</sup> a time to tear, and a time to sew; a time to be silent, and a time to speak;

<sup>8</sup> a time to love, and a time to hate; a time for battle, and a time for peace.

<sup>9</sup> What does the worker gain from his toil?

<sup>10</sup> I have seen the task Elohim has given to the sons of men to be humbled by it.

<sup>11</sup> He has made it all, pretty in its time. Even the ages He has put in their hearts, except that no one finds out the work that Elohim does from beginning to end.

<sup>12</sup> I know that there is no good for them but to rejoice, and to do good in their lives,

<sup>13</sup> and also that every man should eat and drink and enjoy the good of all his labour, it is a gift of Elohim.

<sup>14</sup> I know that whatever Elohim does is forever. There is no adding to it, and there is no taking from it. Elohim does it, that men should fear before Him.

<sup>15</sup> Whatever is has already been, and what shall be has been before. But Elohim seeks out what has been pursued.

<sup>16</sup> Then again I saw under the sun: In the place of right-ruling, wrongness was there. And in the place of righteousness, wrongness was there.

<sup>17</sup> I said in my heart, “Elohim judges the righteous and the wrong, for there is a time for every matter and for every work.”

<sup>18</sup> I said in my heart, “Concerning the matter of the sons of men, Elohim selects them, so as to see that they themselves are beasts.”

<sup>19</sup> For the event of the sons of men is also the event of beasts – one event befalls them: as one dies, so dies the other. Indeed, they all have one breath – man has no advantage over beasts. For all is futile.

<sup>20</sup> All are going to one place – all came from the dust, and all return to dust.

<sup>21</sup> Who knows the spirit of the sons of men, which goes upward, and the spirit of the beast, which goes down to the earth?

<sup>22</sup> So I saw that man could do no better but to rejoice in his own works, for that is his portion. For who would bring him to see what shall be after him?
