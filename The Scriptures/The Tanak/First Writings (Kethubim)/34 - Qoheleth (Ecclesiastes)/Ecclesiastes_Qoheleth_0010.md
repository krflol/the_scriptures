<sup>1</sup> Dead flies make the perfumer’s ointment stink, ferment; a little folly outweighs wisdom, esteem.

<sup>2</sup> A wise man’s heart is at his right hand, but a fool’s heart at his left.

<sup>3</sup> And also, when a fool walks along the way, his heart fails, and he shows everyone that he is a fool.

<sup>4</sup> If the spirit of the ruler rises against you, do not leave your post, for calmness lays to rest great faults.

<sup>5</sup> There is an evil I have seen under the sun, as a mistake coming from the ruler:

<sup>6</sup> Folly is set in many high positions, while the rich sit in a humble place.

<sup>7</sup> I have seen servants on horses – and rulers walking on the ground like servants.

<sup>8</sup> He who digs a pit falls into it, and whoever breaks through a wall is bitten by a snake.

<sup>9</sup> He who quarries stones is hurt by them. He who splits wood is endangered by it.

<sup>10</sup> If an iron tool is blunt, and one does not sharpen the edge, then he needs more strength, and wisdom is advantageous to make right.

<sup>11</sup> If the snake bites without enchantment, then ‘the master of the tongue’ is no better!

<sup>12</sup> Words of a wise man’s mouth show favour, but the lips of a fool swallow him up;

<sup>13</sup> the beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness, and the end of his talk is wicked madness.

<sup>14</sup> And a fool increases words; a man knows not what shall come to be; and who declares to him what shall be after him?

<sup>15</sup> The labour of fools wearies them, because not one knows how to go to the city!

<sup>16</sup> Woe to you, O land, when your sovereign is a youth, and your rulers feast in the morning!

<sup>17</sup> Blessed are you, O land, when your sovereign is the son of nobles, and your rulers feast in due season – for strength and not for drunkenness!

<sup>18</sup> Because of laziness the framework tumbles, and through idleness of hands the house leaks.

<sup>19</sup> A feast is made for laughter, and wine gladdens life; and the silver answers all.

<sup>20</sup> Do not curse the sovereign, even in your thought; do not curse the rich, even in your bedroom; for a bird of the heavens conveys the voice, and a bird in flight makes the matter known.
