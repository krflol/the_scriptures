<sup>1</sup> Remember also your Creator in the days of your youth, before the evil days come, and the years draw near when you say, “I have no pleasure in them”:

<sup>2</sup> Before the sun and the light, the moon and the stars, are darkened, and the clouds return after the rain;

<sup>3</sup> in the day when the guards of the house tremble, and the strong men shall bow down; when the grinders shall cease because they are few, and those that look through the windows shall become dim;

<sup>4</sup> and the doors shall be shut in the streets, and the sound of grinding is low; and one rises up at the sound of a bird, and all the daughters of song are bowed down;

<sup>5</sup> furthermore, they are afraid of what is high, and of low places in the way; and the almond tree blossoms, and the grasshopper becomes a burden, and desire perishes. For man is going to his everlasting home, and the mourners shall go about the streets.

<sup>6</sup> Remember Him before the silver cord is loosed, or the golden bowl is broken, or the jar shattered at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the well,

<sup>7</sup> and the dust returns to the earth as it was, and the spirit returns to Elohim who gave it.

<sup>8</sup> “Futility! Futility!” said the Qoheleth, “All is futile.”

<sup>9</sup> And besides being wise, Qoheleth also taught the people knowledge, and he listened and sought out – set in order many proverbs.

<sup>10</sup> Qoheleth sought to find out words of delight, and words of truth, rightly written.

<sup>11</sup> The words of the wise are like goads, and as nails driven by the masters of collections – they were given by one Shepherd.

<sup>12</sup> And besides these, my son, be warned – the making of many books has no end, and much study is a wearying of the flesh.

<sup>13</sup> Let us hear the conclusion of the entire matter: Fear Elohim and guard His commands, for this applies to all mankind!

<sup>14</sup> For Elohim shall bring every work into right-ruling, including all that is hidden, whether good or whether evil.
