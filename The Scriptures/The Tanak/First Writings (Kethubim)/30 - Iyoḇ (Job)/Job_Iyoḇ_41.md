<sup>1</sup> “Would you draw out Liwiathan with a hook, or snare his tongue with a line which you lower?

<sup>2</sup> Would you put a cord through his nose, or pierce his jaw with a hook?

<sup>3</sup> Would he keep on pleading with you? Would he speak softly to you?

<sup>4</sup> Would he make a covenant with you to be taken as a servant forever?

<sup>5</sup> Would you play with him as with a bird? Or leash him for your young girls?

<sup>6</sup> Would trading partners bargain over him? Would they divide him among the merchants?

<sup>7</sup> Fill his skin with harpoons? Or his head with fishing spears?

<sup>8</sup> Put your hand on him – think of the struggle! Do not do it again!

<sup>9</sup> See, any expectation of him is disappointed – he is laid low even at the sight of him!

<sup>10</sup> No one is so foolhardy to wake him up. Who then is able to stand against Me?

<sup>11</sup> Who has given to Me first, that I should repay him – under all the heavens that is Mine?

<sup>12</sup> I would not keep silent concerning his limbs, or his mighty power, or his fair frame.

<sup>13</sup> Who shall take off the surface of his skin? Who approaches him with a double bridle?

<sup>14</sup> Who shall open the doors of his face, with his frightening teeth all around?

<sup>15</sup> Rows of scales are his pride – closed up, a binding seal.

<sup>16</sup> One to the other they fit closely, not even a breath enters between them.

<sup>17</sup> They are joined one to another, they stick together and are not separated.

<sup>18</sup> His sneezings flash forth light, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.

<sup>19</sup> Out of his mouth go firebrands – sparks of fire shoot out.

<sup>20</sup> Out of his nostrils comes smoke, like a boiling pot or kettle.

<sup>21</sup> His breath sets coals on fire, and a flame goes out of his mouth.

<sup>22</sup> Strength dwells in his neck, and fear leaps before him.

<sup>23</sup> The folds of his flesh cleave together. They are firm on him, immovable.

<sup>24</sup> His heart is as hard as stone, even as hard as the lower millstone.

<sup>25</sup> When he raises himself up, the mighty are afraid. Because of his crashings they are bewildered.

<sup>26</sup> No sword that reaches him does prevail, neither spear, dart, or lance.

<sup>27</sup> He reckons iron as straw, bronze as rotten wood.

<sup>28</sup> The arrow does not make him flee, sling-stones become like stubble to him.

<sup>29</sup> Clubs are reckoned as straw, he laughs at the rattle of a lance.

<sup>30</sup> His undersides are like sharp potsherds. He sprawls on the mud like a threshing-sledge.

<sup>31</sup> He makes the deep boil like a pot, he makes the sea like a pot of ointment.

<sup>32</sup> He leaves a shining path behind him. One would think the deep to be grey-haired.

<sup>33</sup> No one on earth is like him – one made without fear.

<sup>34</sup> He sees all that is haughty. He is sovereign over all the sons of pride.”
