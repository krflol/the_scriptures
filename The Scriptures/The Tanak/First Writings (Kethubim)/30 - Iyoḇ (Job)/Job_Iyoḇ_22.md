<sup>1</sup> And Eliphaz the Tĕmanite answered and said,

<sup>2</sup> “Would a strong man be of use to Ĕl? Even he who is wise be of use to Him?

<sup>3</sup> Is it a delight to the Almighty that you are righteous? Or gain, that you make your ways perfect?

<sup>4</sup> Is it because of your fear of Him that He reproves you, or enters into right-ruling with you?

<sup>5</sup> Is not your evil great? And is there no end to your crookednesses?

<sup>6</sup> For you take pledges from your brother for naught, and strip the naked of their garments.

<sup>7</sup> You do not give the weary water to drink, and you have withheld bread from the hungry.

<sup>8</sup> But the man of strength, he has the earth, and the highly respected man dwells in it.

<sup>9</sup> You have sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless are crushed.

<sup>10</sup> Therefore snares are all around you, and sudden fear alarms you,

<sup>11</sup> or darkness, so that you do not see, and a flood of water covers you.

<sup>12</sup> Is not Eloah in the height of heaven? And see the highest stars, how lofty they are!

<sup>13</sup> And you have said, ‘What does Ĕl know? Would He judge through the dark cloud?

<sup>14</sup> ‘Clouds screen Him, so that He does not see, and He moves about the circuit of the heavens.’

<sup>15</sup> Do you observe the old way which wicked men have trod,

<sup>16</sup> who were cut down before their time, whose foundations were swept away by a flood?

<sup>17</sup> They said to Ĕl, ‘Turn aside from us!’ And what did the Almighty do to them?

<sup>18</sup> Yet He filled their houses with the good! (But the counsel of the wrong has been far from me).

<sup>19</sup> The righteous see it and are glad, and the innocent mock at them and say,

<sup>20</sup> ‘Truly, our adversaries are cut off, and fire has consumed their excess.’

<sup>21</sup> Be of service to Him, and be at peace; thereby blessing shall come to you.

<sup>22</sup> Please accept the Torah from His mouth, and lay up His words in your heart.

<sup>23</sup> If you return to the Almighty, you are built up. If you remove unrighteousness far from your tents,

<sup>24</sup> and lay your gold in the dust, and the gold of Ophir among the stones of the wadis,

<sup>25</sup> then the Almighty shall be your gold and your silver, strength to you.

<sup>26</sup> Then you shall certainly delight in the Almighty, and lift up your face to Eloah,

<sup>27</sup> make your prayer to Him. And He shall hear you, and you shall pay your vows.

<sup>28</sup> And whatever you decide on shall be established for you, and light shine on your ways.

<sup>29</sup> For they have made low, and you say, ‘Up!’ And He saves the lowly of eyes.

<sup>30</sup> Would He deliver one who is not innocent? So by the cleanness of your hands you shall be delivered.”
