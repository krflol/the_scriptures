<sup>1</sup> “Does not man have to struggle on earth? For his days are like the days of a hired man.

<sup>2</sup> Like a servant who sighs for the shade, and like a hireling longing for his wages,

<sup>3</sup> so am I allotted months of futility. And nights of trouble have been appointed to me.

<sup>4</sup> When I lie down, I say, ‘When am I going to rise, and the night be ended?’ For I have had my fill of tossing till dawn.

<sup>5</sup> My body is covered with worms and dirt, my skin is cracked and it festers.

<sup>6</sup> My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle, and are spent without expectancy.

<sup>7</sup> Remember that my life is a breath! My eye is never again to see good.

<sup>8</sup> The eye of him who sees me sees me no longer. Your eyes are upon me, and I am no more.

<sup>9</sup> The cloud fades and vanishes away, so he who goes down to the grave does not come up.

<sup>10</sup> He returns no more to his house, nor does his place know him any more.

<sup>11</sup> I also, I do not hold my mouth, I speak in the distress of my spirit, I complain in the bitterness of my being.

<sup>12</sup> Am I the sea, or a sea monster, that You set a guard over me?

<sup>13</sup> When I say, ‘My bed does comfort me, my couch does ease my complaint,’

<sup>14</sup> then You frighten me with dreams and make me afraid with visions,

<sup>15</sup> so that my being chooses strangling, death rather than my bones.

<sup>16</sup> I have wasted away, I would not live forever. Leave me alone, for my days are a breath.

<sup>17</sup> What is man, that You should make him great, that You should set Your heart on him,

<sup>18</sup> that You should visit him every morning, trying him every moment?

<sup>19</sup> How long do You not look away from me, nor leave me alone till I swallow my saliva?

<sup>20</sup> Have I sinned? What have I done to You, O Watcher of men? Why have You set me as Your target, so that I am a burden to You?

<sup>21</sup> And why do You not pardon my transgression, and take away my crookedness? For now I lie down in the dust, and You shall seek me, but I am not.”
