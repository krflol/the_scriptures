<sup>1</sup> And Iyoḇ answered יהוה and said,

<sup>2</sup> “You know that You are able to do all, and that no purpose is withheld from You.

<sup>3</sup> Who is this that hides counsel without knowledge? Therefore I declared but I did not understand, matters too marvellous for me, which I did not know.

<sup>4</sup> Listen, please, and let me speak. I ask You, then would You make it known to me?’

<sup>5</sup> I have heard of You by the hearing of the ear, but now my eye sees You.

<sup>6</sup> Therefore I despise myself, and repent in dust and ashes.”

<sup>7</sup> And it came to be, after יהוה had spoken these words to Iyoḇ, that יהוה said to Eliphaz the Tĕmanite, “My wrath has burned against you and your two friends, for you have not spoken of Me what is right, as did My servant Iyoḇ.

<sup>8</sup> And now, take seven bulls and seven rams, and go to My servant Iyoḇ, and offer up a burnt offering for yourselves. And let My servant Iyoḇ pray for you – for I accept him – lest I punish you; because you have not spoken of Me what is right, as did My servant Iyoḇ.”

<sup>9</sup> So Eliphaz the Tĕmanite and Bildaḏ the Shuḥite, Tsophar the Na‛amathite went and did as יהוה commanded them. And יהוה accepted the face of Iyoḇ.

<sup>10</sup> And יהוה turned the captivity of Iyoḇ when he prayed for his friends. And יהוה gave Iyoḇ twice as much as he had before.

<sup>11</sup> And all his brothers, and all his sisters, and all those who had been his friends before, came to him and ate food with him in his house. And they sympathised with him and comforted him for all the evil that יהוה had brought upon him. And they each gave him a piece of silver and each one a ring of gold.

<sup>12</sup> And יהוה blessed the latter days of Iyoḇ more than his beginning; for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and one thousand yoke of oxen, and one thousand female donkeys.

<sup>13</sup> And he had seven sons and three daughters.

<sup>14</sup> And he called the name of the first Yemimah, and the name of the second Qetsi‛ah, and the name of the third Qeren-Happuḵ.

<sup>15</sup> And in all the land were found no women so pretty as the daughters of Iyoḇ. And their father gave them an inheritance among their brothers.

<sup>16</sup> And after this Iyoḇ lived one hundred and forty years, and saw his children and grandchildren for four generations.

<sup>17</sup> And Iyoḇ died, old and satisfied with days.
