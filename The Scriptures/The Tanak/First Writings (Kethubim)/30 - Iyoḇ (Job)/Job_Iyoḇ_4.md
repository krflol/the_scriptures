<sup>1</sup> And Eliphaz the Tĕmanite answered and said,

<sup>2</sup> “If one tries a word with you, would you become impatient? But who is able to withhold himself from speaking?

<sup>3</sup> See, you have instructed many, and you have made weak hands strong.

<sup>4</sup> Your words have raised up him who was stumbling, and you have strengthened the weak knees.

<sup>5</sup> But now it has come to you, and you are impatient; it strikes you, and you are troubled.

<sup>6</sup> Is not your reverence your trust, the integrity of ways your expectancy?

<sup>7</sup> Remember, please: Who, being innocent, has ever perished? And where have the straight ones ever been cut off?

<sup>8</sup> According to what I have seen, those who plough wickedness and sow suffering reap the same.

<sup>9</sup> Through the breath of Eloah they perish, and through the Spirit of His nostrils they are consumed.

<sup>10</sup> The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, but the teeth of the young lions shall be broken.

<sup>11</sup> An old lion perishes for lack of prey, and the cubs of the lioness are scattered.

<sup>12</sup> And unto me a word was secretly brought, and my ear received a little of it.

<sup>13</sup> Amid thoughts from visions of the night, when deep sleep falls on men,

<sup>14</sup> fear came upon me, and trembling, causing my bones to shake greatly.

<sup>15</sup> Then a spirit passed before my face, the hair on my body stood up.

<sup>16</sup> It stood still, but I could not discern its appearance. A form was before my eyes – silence, then a voice I heard,

<sup>17</sup> ‘Is mortal man more righteous than Eloah? Is man more clean than his Maker?

<sup>18</sup> ‘Look, He puts no trust in His servants, and He charges His messengers with straying.

<sup>19</sup> ‘How much more those who dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, who are crushed like a moth?

<sup>20</sup> ‘From morning till evening they are beaten down, they perish forever, with no one regarding.

<sup>21</sup> ‘Are not the cords of their tents pulled up? They die, without wisdom!’
