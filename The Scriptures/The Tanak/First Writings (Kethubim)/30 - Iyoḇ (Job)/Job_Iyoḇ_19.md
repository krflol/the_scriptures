<sup>1</sup> And Iyoḇ answered and said,

<sup>2</sup> “How long would you grieve my life, and crush me with words?

<sup>3</sup> These ten times you have insulted me, shamelessly you attack me.

<sup>4</sup> Even if I have truly gone astray, my straying remains with me.

<sup>5</sup> If indeed you would exalt yourselves above me, and plead against me my reproach,

<sup>6</sup> know then that Eloah has overthrown me, and has surrounded me with His net.

<sup>7</sup> See, I cry, ‘Violence!’ but I am not heard. I cry aloud, but there is no right-ruling.

<sup>8</sup> He has fenced up my way, and I pass not over. And He has placed darkness in my paths.

<sup>9</sup> He has stripped me of my esteem, and taken the crown from my head.

<sup>10</sup> He breaks me down on every side, and I am gone; and uproots my expectancy like a tree.

<sup>11</sup> And He kindled His wrath against me, and He counts me as one of His enemies.

<sup>12</sup> His companies come together, and they cast up their way against me, and encamp all around my tent.

<sup>13</sup> He has removed my brothers far away from me, and my friends are completely estranged from me.

<sup>14</sup> My near ones have fallen away, and my close friends have forgotten me.

<sup>15</sup> The guests in my house, and my female servants, reckon me for a stranger – I am a foreigner in their eyes.

<sup>16</sup> I have called my servant, but he gives no answer – I have to beg him with my mouth.

<sup>17</sup> My spirit is strange to my wife, and my kindness to the children of my own body.

<sup>18</sup> Even young children have scorned me. I rise, and they speak against me.

<sup>19</sup> All my intimate friends loathe me, and those whom I love have turned against me.

<sup>20</sup> My bone clings to my skin and to my flesh, and I have escaped by the skin of my teeth.

<sup>21</sup> Show favour to me, show favour to me, O you my friends, for the hand of Eloah has struck me!

<sup>22</sup> Why do you persecute me like Ĕl does, and are not satisfied with my flesh?

<sup>23</sup> Oh, that my words were written down! Oh, that they were inscribed in a book,

<sup>24</sup> engraved on a rock with an iron pen and lead, forever!

<sup>25</sup> For I know that my Redeemer lives, and as the Last shall rise over the dust;

<sup>26</sup> and after my skin has been struck off, then in my flesh I shall see Eloah,

<sup>27</sup> whom I myself shall see on my side, and not a stranger. My kidneys have failed within me!

<sup>28</sup> If you say, ‘Why do we persecute him?’ Seeing the root of the matter has been found in me,

<sup>29</sup> fear the sword yourselves, for wrath brings the punishment of the sword, so that you know there is a judgment.”
