<sup>1</sup> “But now they laugh at me, those younger than I, whose fathers I would have refused to put with my sheep dogs.

<sup>2</sup> Of what use to me is the strength of their hands, since their manhood power has perished?

<sup>3</sup> They are dried up from lack and hunger, they flee to a parched land, formerly a waste and ruin.

<sup>4</sup> They pluck salt herbs by the bushes, and broom tree roots for their food.

<sup>5</sup> They were driven out from among men, they shouted at them as at a thief,

<sup>6</sup> to dwell in the gullies of wadis, holes of the ground and clefts.

<sup>7</sup> Among the bushes they cry out, under the nettles they huddled together –

<sup>8</sup> sons of fools, even sons without a name, they have been whipped out of the land.

<sup>9</sup> And now I have become their song, and I am a byword to them.

<sup>10</sup> They have loathed me, they have kept far from me, and did not refrain from spitting in my face.

<sup>11</sup> Because He has loosed my bowstring and afflicted me, they have thrown off restraint in my presence.

<sup>12</sup> At my right hand a brood rises; they pushed away my feet, and they raise up against me their destructive ways.

<sup>13</sup> They have broken up my path, they gain by my ruin; no one restrains them.

<sup>14</sup> They come as through a wide breach; rushing on me under the ruins.

<sup>15</sup> Destructions are turned upon me; they pursue my life as the wind, and my welfare has passed like a cloud.

<sup>16</sup> And now my life pours itself out; days of affliction seize me.

<sup>17</sup> My bones have been pierced in me at night, and my gnawings never lie down.

<sup>18</sup> By great exertion is my garment changed – it girds me as the collar of my coat,

<sup>19</sup> throwing me into the mud, and I have become like dust and ashes.

<sup>20</sup> I cry out to You, but You do not answer me; I stand up, but You only look at me.

<sup>21</sup> You have become cruel to me; with the power of Your hand You oppose me.

<sup>22</sup> You lift me up to the wind, making me to ride it; and You melt me in a storm.

<sup>23</sup> For I have known that You bring me to death, and to the house appointed for all living.

<sup>24</sup> Yet does not one in a heap of ruins stretch out his hand, or in calamity cry out for help?

<sup>25</sup> Did I not weep for him who was in trouble? Was my being not grieved for the poor?

<sup>26</sup> When I looked for good, then evil came to me. And when I waited for light, darkness came.

<sup>27</sup> My inward parts boiled and did not rest; days of affliction went before me.

<sup>28</sup> I went about blackened, but not by the sun; I stood up in the assembly, I cried for help.

<sup>29</sup> I became a brother of jackals, and a companion of ostriches.

<sup>30</sup> My skin became black upon me, and my bones burned with heat.

<sup>31</sup> So my lyre becomes mourning, and my flute the sound of weeping.
