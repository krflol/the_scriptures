<sup>1</sup> And Bildaḏ the Shuḥite answered and said,

<sup>2</sup> “Rule and fear belong to Him, making peace in His high places.

<sup>3</sup> Is there any number to His armies? And on whom does His light not rise?

<sup>4</sup> So how could man be righteous before Ĕl? Or how could he be flawless who is born of a woman?

<sup>5</sup> See, even the moon does not shine, and the stars have not been flawless in His eyes,

<sup>6</sup> how much less man, a maggot, and a son of man, a worm?”
