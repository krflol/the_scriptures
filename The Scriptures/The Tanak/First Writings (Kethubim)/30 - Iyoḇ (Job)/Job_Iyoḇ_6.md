<sup>1</sup> And Iyoḇ answered and said,

<sup>2</sup> “Oh, that my grief were thoroughly weighed, and my calamity be placed on the scales!

<sup>3</sup> For it would outweigh the sand of the sea, therefore my words have been rash.

<sup>4</sup> For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, my spirit drinks in their poison, the onslaughts of Eloah are arrayed against me.

<sup>5</sup> Does the wild donkey bray when it has grass, or does the ox bellow over its fodder?

<sup>6</sup> Is tasteless food eaten without salt? Is there any flavour in the juice of mallows?

<sup>7</sup> I refuse to touch it, they are like food when I am sick.

<sup>8</sup> Oh that I might have my desire, that Eloah would grant me what I long for!

<sup>9</sup> That it would please Eloah to crush me, loose His hand and cut me off!

<sup>10</sup> Then I would still have comfort, and I would rejoice in pain, though not spared, for I have not hidden the words of the Set-apart One.

<sup>11</sup> What strength do I have, that I should wait? And what is my end, that I should prolong my life?

<sup>12</sup> Is my strength the strength of stones? Is my flesh of bronze?

<sup>13</sup> Is my help not within me? And is ability driven from me?

<sup>14</sup> To a despiser of friends: shame! For he is forsaking the fear of the Almighty.

<sup>15</sup> My brothers are as undependable as a wadi, as a bed on which streams once ran,

<sup>16</sup> which are dark because of the ice, in which the snow is hidden.

<sup>17</sup> When it is warm, they cease to flow; when it is hot, they vanish from their place.

<sup>18</sup> The paths of their way turn aside, they enter wastes and perish.

<sup>19</sup> Passengers of Tĕma looked expectantly, travellers of Sheḇa waited for them.

<sup>20</sup> They were ashamed because they had trusted, they came there and were disappointed.

<sup>21</sup> Indeed, you have now become the same! You see my downfall and are afraid.

<sup>22</sup> Did I ever say, ‘Give to me’? or, ‘Offer a bribe for me from your wealth’?

<sup>23</sup> or, ‘Rescue me from the hand of the enemy?’ or, ‘Redeem me from the hand of oppressors’?

<sup>24</sup> Teach me, and I shall be silent. And show me where I have gone astray.

<sup>25</sup> Words of uprightness are harsh! But what does your reproving reprove?

<sup>26</sup> Do you reckon to reprove my words, and the sayings of one in despair, which are as wind?

<sup>27</sup> You would cast lots over the fatherless, and make merchandise of your friend!

<sup>28</sup> But now, please look at me – whether I would lie to your face.

<sup>29</sup> Relent, please, let there be no unrighteousness. Relent! My righteousness is still in it.

<sup>30</sup> Is there unrighteousness on my tongue? Does my taste not discern what is perverse?
