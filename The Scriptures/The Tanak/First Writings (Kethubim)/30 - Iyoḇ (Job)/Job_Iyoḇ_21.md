<sup>1</sup> And Iyoḇ answered and said,

<sup>2</sup> “Listen closely to my word, and let this be your comfort.

<sup>3</sup> Bear with me and let me speak, and after I have spoken, keep mocking.

<sup>4</sup> As for me, is my complaint against man? And why should I not be impatient?

<sup>5</sup> Look at me and be appalled, then put your hand on your mouth.

<sup>6</sup> And when I consider it I am frightened, and my body shudders.

<sup>7</sup> Why do the wrong live, become old, and become mighty in power?

<sup>8</sup> Their seed is established with them before their face, and their offspring before their eyes.

<sup>9</sup> Their houses are peace without fear, neither is the rod of Eloah upon them.

<sup>10</sup> Their bull breeds and does not fail, their cow calves without miscarriage.

<sup>11</sup> They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance.

<sup>12</sup> They sing to the tambourine and lyre, and rejoice to the sound of the flute.

<sup>13</sup> They spend their days in goodness, and in a moment go down to the grave.

<sup>14</sup> And they say to Ĕl, ‘Turn aside from us, for we have no desire to know Your ways.

<sup>15</sup> Who is the Almighty, that we should serve Him? And what profit do we have if we pray to Him?’

<sup>16</sup> See, is their good not in their own hand? (The counsel of the wrong has been far from me).

<sup>17</sup> How often is the lamp of the wrong put out, and does come upon them their calamity, sorrows He allots in His displeasure?

<sup>18</sup> They are like straw before the wind, and like chaff that a storm steals away.

<sup>19</sup> You say, ‘Eloah stores up one’s wickedness for his children.’ Let Him repay him, so that he knows it.

<sup>20</sup> Let his eyes see his destruction, and let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty.

<sup>21</sup> For what is his delight in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off?

<sup>22</sup> Does anyone teach Ĕl knowledge, since He judges those that are exalted?

<sup>23</sup> One dies in his perfect strength, completely at ease and satisfied;

<sup>24</sup> His pails are filled with milk, and his bones are juicy with marrow.

<sup>25</sup> Another one dies in the bitterness of his being, and never eats with pleasure.

<sup>26</sup> Together they lie down in the dust, and worms cover them.

<sup>27</sup> Look, I know your thoughts, and the plots with which you would wrong me.

<sup>28</sup> For you say, ‘Where is the house of the noble one? And where is the tent, the dwelling place of the wrong ones?’

<sup>29</sup> Have you not asked those passing by the way? And do you not know their signs?

<sup>30</sup> That the wicked is kept for the day of calamity. They are brought to the day of wrath.

<sup>31</sup> Who declares his way to his face? And who repays him for what he has done?

<sup>32</sup> As for him, he is brought to the grave, and a watch is kept over the tomb.

<sup>33</sup> The clods of the wadi shall be sweet to him, and all men follow him, innumerable are those before him.

<sup>34</sup> How then do you comfort me in vain, seeing that perverseness remains in your answers?”
