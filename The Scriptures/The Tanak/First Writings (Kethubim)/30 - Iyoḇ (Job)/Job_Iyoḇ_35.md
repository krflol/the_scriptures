<sup>1</sup> And Elihu responded and said,

<sup>2</sup> “Do you think this is right? Do you say, ‘My righteousness is more than that of Ĕl’?

<sup>3</sup> For you say, ‘Of what use is it to you? What do I gain more than if I had sinned?’

<sup>4</sup> Let me answer you and your friends with you.

<sup>5</sup> Look to the heavens, and see. And consider the clouds which are higher than you.

<sup>6</sup> If you sin, what would you do against Him? If your transgressions are increased, what would you do to Him?

<sup>7</sup> If you are righteous, what do you give Him? Or what does He receive from your hand?

<sup>8</sup> Your wrong is for a man like yourself, and your righteousness for a son of man.

<sup>9</sup> Because of the multitude of oppressions they cry out; they cry out for help because of the arm of the many.

<sup>10</sup> And no one says, ‘Where is Eloah my Maker, who gives songs in the night,

<sup>11</sup> teaching us more than the beasts of the earth, and makes us wiser than the birds of the heavens?’

<sup>12</sup> There they cry, but He answers not, because of the pride of evil ones.

<sup>13</sup> Only, it is false that Ĕl does not hear, and that the Almighty pays no attention to it.

<sup>14</sup> Although you say you do not see Him, yet right-ruling is before Him, and you wait for Him.

<sup>15</sup> And now, is it for naught that His displeasure has come? Yet He has not taken note of extreme arrogance,

<sup>16</sup> so Iyoḇ opens his mouth in vain, he increases words without knowledge.”
