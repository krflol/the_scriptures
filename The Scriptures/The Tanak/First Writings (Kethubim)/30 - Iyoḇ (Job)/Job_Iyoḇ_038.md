<sup>1</sup> Then יהוה answered Iyoḇ out of the whirlwind, and said,

<sup>2</sup> “Who is this who darkens counsel by words without knowledge?

<sup>3</sup> Now gird up your loins like a man, and I ask you, and you answer Me.

<sup>4</sup> Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth? Declare, if you have understanding.

<sup>5</sup> Who set its measurements, if you know? Or who stretched the line upon it?

<sup>6</sup> Upon what were its foundations sunk? Or who laid its corner-stone,

<sup>7</sup> when the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of Elohim shouted for joy?

<sup>8</sup> Or who enclosed the sea with doors, when it burst forth and came from the womb;

<sup>9</sup> when I made the clouds its garment, and thick darkness its swaddling band;

<sup>10</sup> and assigned for it My law, and set bars and doors;

<sup>11</sup> and said, ‘This far you have come, but no farther, and here your proud waves stop?’

<sup>12</sup> Have you ever commanded the morning, and caused the dawn to know its place,

<sup>13</sup> to take hold of the ends of the earth, and the wrong be shaken out of it?

<sup>14</sup> It is changed like clay under a seal, and they stand out like a garment.

<sup>15</sup> And their light is withheld from the wrong, and the arm lifted up is broken.

<sup>16</sup> Have you come to the sources of the sea? Or have you walked about in the recesses of the deep?

<sup>17</sup> Were the gates of death revealed to you? Or have you seen the gates of the shadow of death?

<sup>18</sup> Have you understood the breadth of the earth? Declare, if you know it all.

<sup>19</sup> Where is the way to the dwelling of light? And darkness, where is its place,

<sup>20</sup> that you should take it to its boundary, and know the paths to its home?

<sup>21</sup> Do you know? For you would have been born then, and the number of your days been many!

<sup>22</sup> Have you entered into the storehouses of snow, or have you seen the storehouses of hail,

<sup>23</sup> which I have kept for the time of distress, for the day of fighting and battle?

<sup>24</sup> Where is the way that light is divided, or the east wind scattered over the earth?

<sup>25</sup> Who has cleft a channel for the overflowing water, or a way for the thunderclaps,

<sup>26</sup> to make rain fall on land where no one is, a wilderness in which there is no man;

<sup>27</sup> to satisfy the wild and waste places, and to make the seeds of grass to sprout?

<sup>28</sup> Does the rain have a father? Or who has brought forth the drops of dew?

<sup>29</sup> From whose belly comes the ice? And who gave birth to the frost of the heavens?

<sup>30</sup> The waters harden like stone, and the surface of the deep is frozen.

<sup>31</sup> Do you bind the bands of Kimah, or loosen the cords of Kesil?

<sup>32</sup> Do you bring out the constellations in its season? Or do you lead the Bear with its sons?

<sup>33</sup> Do you know the laws of the heavens? Or do you set their rule over the earth?

<sup>34</sup> Do you lift up your voice to the clouds, so that floods of water cover you?

<sup>35</sup> Do you send out lightnings, and they go and say to you, ‘Here we are!’?

<sup>36</sup> Who has put wisdom in the inward parts? Or who has given understanding to the heart?

<sup>37</sup> Who has wisdom to count the clouds, or to tip over the bottles of the heavens,

<sup>38</sup> when the dust hardens in clumps, and the clods cling together?

<sup>39</sup> Do you hunt the prey for the lion, or satisfy the appetite of the young lions,

<sup>40</sup> when they crouch in dens, sit in the cover of their hiding place?

<sup>41</sup> Who provides food for the raven, when its young ones cry to Ĕl, and wander about without food?
