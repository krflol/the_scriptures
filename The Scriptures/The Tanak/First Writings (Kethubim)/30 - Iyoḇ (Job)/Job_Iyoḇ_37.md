<sup>1</sup> “At this too my heart trembles, and leaps from its place.

<sup>2</sup> Listen, listen to the trembling of His voice, and the sound that comes from His mouth.

<sup>3</sup> He lets it loose under all the heavens, and His lightning to the ends of the earth.

<sup>4</sup> After it a voice roars. He thunders with the voice of His excellency, and He does not hold them back when His voice is heard.

<sup>5</sup> Ĕl thunders wondrously with His voice; doing great deeds, which we do not understand.

<sup>6</sup> For He says to the snow, ‘Be on the earth,’ also to the gentle rain and the heavy rain of His strength.

<sup>7</sup> He seals up the hand of every man, for all men to know His work.

<sup>8</sup> Then the beast goes into its lair, and they stay in their dens.

<sup>9</sup> From the room of the south comes the whirlwind, and cold from the scattering winds of the north.

<sup>10</sup> By the breath of Ĕl ice is given, and the expanse of water becomes solid.

<sup>11</sup> He also loads the thick clouds with moisture; He scatters His bright clouds.

<sup>12</sup> And they swirl about, being turned by His guidance, to do whatever He commands them on the face of the earthly world.

<sup>13</sup> He causes it to come, whether as a rod, or for His land, or for kindness.

<sup>14</sup> Listen to this, O Iyoḇ, stand still and consider the wonders of Ĕl.

<sup>15</sup> Do you know when Eloah placed them, and caused the lightning of His cloud to shine?

<sup>16</sup> Do you know the balancing of the clouds, the wonders of the One perfect in knowledge?

<sup>17</sup> Why are your garments hot, when the earth is stilled from the south?

<sup>18</sup> Did you, with Him, spread out the clouds, strong as a hard mirror?

<sup>19</sup> Teach us what we should say to Him; we do not set in order because of darkness.

<sup>20</sup> Should He be told that I would speak? Would any man ask to be swallowed up?

<sup>21</sup> And now, they shall not look on the light that is bright behind the clouds, when the wind has passed and cleared them.

<sup>22</sup> From the golden north it comes – with Eloah is awesome excellency.

<sup>23</sup> The Almighty, we have not found Him out, He is exalted in power and right-ruling and great in righteousness – He does not oppress.

<sup>24</sup> Therefore men fear Him. He does not regard any who are wise of heart.”
