<sup>1</sup> And Iyoḇ answered and said,

<sup>2</sup> “How have you helped the powerless, saved an arm not strong?

<sup>3</sup> How have you given counsel to the unwise, or declared sound advice to many?

<sup>4</sup> With whom have you spoken words? And whose spirit came from you?

<sup>5</sup> The dead wait – those under the waters and those inhabiting them.

<sup>6</sup> The grave is naked before Him, and destruction has no covering.

<sup>7</sup> He it was who stretched out the north over emptiness, hanging the earth upon space,

<sup>8</sup> binding up waters in His thick clouds, and the cloud is not torn under them,

<sup>9</sup> covering the surface of His throne, spreading His cloud over it.

<sup>10</sup> He drew a limit on the surface of the waters, at the boundary of light and darkness.

<sup>11</sup> The columns of the heavens tremble, and are stunned at His reproof.

<sup>12</sup> By His power He has calmed the sea, and by His understanding He struck down Rahaḇ.

<sup>13</sup> By His Spirit He adorned the heavens. His hand whirled the fleeing serpent.

<sup>14</sup> See, these are the fringes of His ways, and how little a matter is heard of Him! And who understands the thunder of His power?”
