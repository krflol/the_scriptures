<sup>1</sup> And יהוה answered Iyoḇ, and said,

<sup>2</sup> “Should a reprover contend with the Almighty? Let him who reproves Eloah answer it.”

<sup>3</sup> And Iyoḇ answered יהוה and said,

<sup>4</sup> “See, I am insignificant, what would I answer You? I lay my hand over my mouth.

<sup>5</sup> Once I have spoken, but I have no answer – and twice, but I say no more.”

<sup>6</sup> Then יהוה answered Iyoḇ out of the whirlwind, and said,

<sup>7</sup> “Now gird up your loins like a man; I ask you, and you answer Me.

<sup>8</sup> Would you also set aside My judgment? Would you pronounce Me wrong, and you be declared righteous?

<sup>9</sup> Or do you have an arm like Ĕl? Or do you thunder with a voice like His?

<sup>10</sup> Deck yourself, please, with excellency and grandeur, and put on esteem and splendour.

<sup>11</sup> Scatter abroad the rage of your wrath, and look on everyone who is proud and bring him low.

<sup>12</sup> Look on everyone who is proud, humble him. And tread down the wrong-doers in their place.

<sup>13</sup> Hide them in the dust together, bind their faces in obscurity.

<sup>14</sup> Then even I would confess to you that your own right hand does save you.

<sup>15</sup> See now, Behĕmoth, which I made along with you – he eats grass like an ox.

<sup>16</sup> See now, his strength is in his loins, and his power is in his stomach muscles.

<sup>17</sup> He bends his tail like a cedar; the sinews of his thighs are knit together.

<sup>18</sup> His bones are like tubes of bronze, his ribs like bars of iron.

<sup>19</sup> He is the beginning of the ways of Ĕl. His Maker brings near His sword.

<sup>20</sup> For the mountains yield food for him, and all the beasts of the field play there.

<sup>21</sup> He lies under the slender trees, under cover of reed and swamp.

<sup>22</sup> The slender trees cover him with their shade; the willows by the stream surround him.

<sup>23</sup> See, if a river rages, he is not alarmed; he feels safe, even if the Yardĕn gushes into his mouth,

<sup>24</sup> Before his eyes, shall he be caught, with snares? Or his nose pierced?
