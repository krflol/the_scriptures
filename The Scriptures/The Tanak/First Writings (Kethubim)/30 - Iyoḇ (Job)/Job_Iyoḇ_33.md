<sup>1</sup> “And yet, O Iyoḇ, please hear my speech and listen to all my words.

<sup>2</sup> See, please! I shall open my mouth, my tongue shall speak in my mouth.

<sup>3</sup> My words are from the uprightness of my heart, my lips shall speak knowledge clearly.

<sup>4</sup> The Spirit of Ĕl has made me, and the breath of the Almighty gives me life.

<sup>5</sup> If you are able, answer me, set yourself in order before me, take your stand.

<sup>6</sup> See, I am like you before Ĕl, I too have been formed out of clay.

<sup>7</sup> See, no fear of me should alarm you, nor should pressure by me be heavy on you.

<sup>8</sup> But you have spoken in my hearing, and the sound of words I hear, saying,

<sup>9</sup> ‘I am clear, without transgression; I am innocent, and I have no crookedness.

<sup>10</sup> See, He finds occasions against me, He counts me as His enemy;

<sup>11</sup> He puts my feet in the stocks, He watches all my paths.’

<sup>12</sup> See, in this you have not been righteous. Let me answer you: Eloah is greater than man!

<sup>13</sup> Why have you complained against Him? Because He does not answer all His matters?

<sup>14</sup> For Ĕl does speak once, or twice – though one does not notice it –

<sup>15</sup> in a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls upon men, while slumbering on a bed,

<sup>16</sup> then He opens the ears of men, and seals their instruction,

<sup>17</sup> to turn man from his deed, and conceal pride from man.

<sup>18</sup> He keeps back his being from the Pit, and his life from passing away by the sword.

<sup>19</sup> And he is reproved with pain on his bed, and with unceasing distress in his bones,

<sup>20</sup> so that his life loathes bread, and his being desirable food.

<sup>21</sup> His flesh wastes away, and his bones which were not seen stick out.

<sup>22</sup> And his being draws near the Pit, and his life to the destroyers.

<sup>23</sup> If there is a messenger for him, a mediator, one among a thousand, to show man His straightness,

<sup>24</sup> then He shows favour to him, and says, ‘Release him from going down to the Pit, I have found an atonement.

<sup>25</sup> ‘Let his flesh become fresher than a child’s, let him return to the days of his youth.’

<sup>26</sup> He prays to Eloah, and He accepts him. And he sees His face with joy, and He restores to man his righteousness.

<sup>27</sup> He sings to men and says, ‘I have sinned, and I have perverted what was right, and it did not profit me.’

<sup>28</sup> He has redeemed my being from going down to the Pit, and my life sees the light.

<sup>29</sup> See, Ĕl does all these – twice, three times with a man,

<sup>30</sup> to bring back his being from the Pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living.

<sup>31</sup> Pay attention, Iyoḇ, listen to me, keep silent, and let me speak.

<sup>32</sup> If there are words, answer me; speak, for I desire to declare you right.

<sup>33</sup> If not, listen to me, keep silent, and let me teach you wisdom.”
