<sup>1</sup> Then Elihu continued and said,

<sup>2</sup> “Bear with me a little, and let me show you there is still more to say for Elohim.

<sup>3</sup> I bring my knowledge from afar and ascribe righteousness to my Maker.

<sup>4</sup> For truly my words are not false; the One perfect in knowledge is with you.

<sup>5</sup> See, Ĕl is mighty, but rejects no one – mighty in power and heart.

<sup>6</sup> He does not keep the wrongdoer alive, but He gives right-ruling to the oppressed ones.

<sup>7</sup> He does not withdraw His eyes from the righteous, and sovereigns on the throne, and seats them forever, and they are exalted.

<sup>8</sup> And if they are bound in shackles, caught in the cords of affliction,

<sup>9</sup> then He reveals to them their work, and their transgressions, that they behaved proudly.

<sup>10</sup> And He opens their ear for discipline, and commands that they turn back from wickedness.

<sup>11</sup> If they obey and serve, they complete their days in blessedness, and their years in pleasantness.

<sup>12</sup> But if they do not obey, they perish by the sword, and die without knowledge.

<sup>13</sup> But the defiled ones in heart become enraged – let them not cry for help when He binds them.

<sup>14</sup> Their being dies in youth, and their life among the male prostitutes.

<sup>15</sup> He rescues the afflicted one in his affliction, and opens their ears in oppression.

<sup>16</sup> And He also would have brought you out of distress, into a broad place where there is no restraint. And what is set on your table would be filled with rich food.

<sup>17</sup> But you are filled with the judgment of the wrong, judgment and right-ruling take hold of you.

<sup>18</sup> Beware, that rage does not entice you to scoffing. And do not let a large bribe turn you aside.

<sup>19</sup> Would He value your riches? No, not precious ore, nor all your strength!

<sup>20</sup> Do not long for the night, when people go up in their place.

<sup>21</sup> Beware, do not turn to wickedness, for you have chosen this rather than affliction.

<sup>22</sup> See, Ĕl is exalted by His power; who is a Teacher like Him?

<sup>23</sup> Who has appointed Him His way, or who has said, ‘You have worked unrighteousness’?

<sup>24</sup> Remember to extol His work, of which men have sung.

<sup>25</sup> All men have seen it, man looks on it from afar.

<sup>26</sup> See, Ĕl is great, beyond our under-standing, and we do not know the number of His years.

<sup>27</sup> For He draws up drops of water, which distil as rain from the mist,

<sup>28</sup> which the clouds drop down – pour down in showers on man.

<sup>29</sup> Also, who understands the spreading of clouds, the crashing from His booth?

<sup>30</sup> See, He has spread his light upon it, and He has covered the depths of the sea.

<sup>31</sup> For by these He judges the peoples; He gives plenty of food.

<sup>32</sup> He has covered His hands with lightning, and commands it to strike.

<sup>33</sup> Its noise declares concerning Him, also the cattle, as to what is coming up.
