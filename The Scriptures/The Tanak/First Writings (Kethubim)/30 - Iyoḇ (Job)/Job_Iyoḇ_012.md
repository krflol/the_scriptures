<sup>1</sup> And Iyoḇ answered and said,

<sup>2</sup> “Truly you are the people, and wisdom would die with you!

<sup>3</sup> But I, like you, have a heart too; I am not less than you. And who does not know such as these?

<sup>4</sup> I have become a laughing-stock to my friends – one who has called on Eloah and He answered him! A laughing-stock is the righteous, the perfect one!

<sup>5</sup> A lamp is despised in the thought of one who is at ease – prepared for those whose feet slip.

<sup>6</sup> The tents of robbers are at peace, and those who provoke Ĕl are complacent, to him who brings Eloah into his hand!

<sup>7</sup> But now ask the beasts, and they teach you; and the birds of the heavens, and they declare it to you;

<sup>8</sup> or speak to the earth, and it teaches you; and the fish of the sea inform you.

<sup>9</sup> Who among all these does not know that the hand of יהוה has done this,

<sup>10</sup> in whose hand is the life of all that live, and the breath of all mankind?

<sup>11</sup> Does the ear not try words? And the mouth taste food for itself?

<sup>12</sup> With the aged is wisdom, and understanding with length of days.

<sup>13</sup> With Him are wisdom and might, He has counsel and understanding.

<sup>14</sup> Look, He breaks down, and it is not rebuilt. If He imprisons a man, there is no release.

<sup>15</sup> Look, He withholds the waters, and they dry up. And He sends them out, and they overwhelm the earth.

<sup>16</sup> With Him are strength and ability. The misled and the misleader are His.

<sup>17</sup> He leads counsellors away stripped, and makes judges go mad.

<sup>18</sup> He loosens the bonds of sovereigns, and binds a girdle on their loins;

<sup>19</sup> who leads away priests as a spoil, and overthrows the mighty;

<sup>20</sup> turning aside the lip of the trusted ones, and takes away the discernment of the elders;

<sup>21</sup> pouring scorn on nobles, and loosens the girdle of the strong;

<sup>22</sup> revealing deep matters out of darkness, and He brings the shadow of death to light;

<sup>23</sup> making nations great, and He destroys them; spreading out the nations, and He leads them out.

<sup>24</sup> turning aside the heart of the chiefs of the people of the earth, and He makes them wander in a pathless waste.

<sup>25</sup> They grope in darkness, having no light, and He makes them stagger like a drunkard.
