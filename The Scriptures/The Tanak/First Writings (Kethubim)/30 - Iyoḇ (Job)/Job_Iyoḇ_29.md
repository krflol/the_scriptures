<sup>2</sup> “Oh, that I were as in months past, as in the days when Eloah protected me;

<sup>3</sup> when His lamp shone on my head, when I walked in the dark by His light;

<sup>4</sup> as I was in the days of my autumn, when the intimacy of Eloah was on my tent;

<sup>5</sup> when the Almighty was still with me, when my children were around me;

<sup>6</sup> when my steps were bathed with cream, and the rock poured out rivers of oil for me.

<sup>7</sup> When I went out to the gate by the city, to take my seat in the open square,

<sup>8</sup> the young men saw me and hid, and the aged rose up, they stood;

<sup>9</sup> rulers held back their words, and laid a hand on their mouth;

<sup>10</sup> the voice of leaders was hushed, and their tongue clung to the roof of their mouth.

<sup>11</sup> For when the ear heard, it blessed me, and when the eye saw, it gave witness of me;

<sup>12</sup> because I rescued the poor who cried out, and the fatherless who had no helper.

<sup>13</sup> The blessing of the perishing one would come upon me, and I made the widow’s heart sing for joy.

<sup>14</sup> I put on righteousness, and it robed me; right-ruling was my cloak and turban.

<sup>15</sup> I was eyes to the blind, and I was feet to the lame.

<sup>16</sup> I was a father to the poor, and I investigated the case which I did not know.

<sup>17</sup> And I broke the jaws of the perverse, and snatched the prey from his teeth.

<sup>18</sup> Then I thought I would die in my nest, and increase my days as the sand,

<sup>19</sup> my root reaching out to the waters, and dew lying all night on my branch,

<sup>20</sup> my esteem fresh within me, and my bow renewed in my hand.

<sup>21</sup> To me they listened, and they waited, and kept silence at my counsel.

<sup>22</sup> After my words they did not speak again, and my speech settled on them.

<sup>23</sup> And they waited for me like the rain, and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain.

<sup>24</sup> I smiled at those who did not believe, and the light of my face they did not dim.

<sup>25</sup> I chose the way for them, and sat as chief, and I dwelt like a sovereign in the army, like one who comforts mourners.
