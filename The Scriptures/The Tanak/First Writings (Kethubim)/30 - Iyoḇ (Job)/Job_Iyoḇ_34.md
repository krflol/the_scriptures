<sup>1</sup> Then Elihu responded and said,

<sup>2</sup> “Hear my words, you wise men; give ear to me, you who have knowledge.

<sup>3</sup> For the ear tries words as the palate tastes food.

<sup>4</sup> Let us choose what is right for us; let us know among us what is good.

<sup>5</sup> For Iyoḇ has said, ‘I am righteous, but Ĕl has taken away my right.

<sup>6</sup> Would I lie concerning my right? My wound is incurable – without transgression.’

<sup>7</sup> What man is like Iyoḇ, who drinks mocking like water,

<sup>8</sup> who goes in company with the workers of wickedness, and walks with men of wrongness?

<sup>9</sup> For he has said, ‘It does not profit a man that he takes delight in Elohim.’

<sup>10</sup> Therefore, listen to me, you men of heart: far be it from Ĕl to do wrong, and from the Almighty to commit unrighteousness.

<sup>11</sup> For He repays man’s work to him, and makes man to find a reward according to his path.

<sup>12</sup> The truth is, Ĕl does not do wrong, and the Almighty does not twist right-ruling.

<sup>13</sup> Who has assigned to Him the earth? And who has laid out all the world?

<sup>14</sup> If He sets His heart on him, should He gather to Himself his spirit and his breath,

<sup>15</sup> all flesh would expire together and man return to dust.

<sup>16</sup> If you have understanding, hear this! Give ear to the sound of my words:

<sup>17</sup> Should the one who hates right-ruling govern? Or would you declare a most righteous one wrong?

<sup>18</sup> Who shall say to a sovereign: ‘Beliya‛al,’ to nobles: ‘Wrong one’? –

<sup>19</sup> who is not partial to princes, nor regards the rich more than the poor? For they are all the work of His hands.

<sup>20</sup> In a moment they die, in the middle of the night; the people are shaken and pass away; and the mighty are taken away without a hand.

<sup>21</sup> For His eyes are on the ways of man, and He sees all his steps.

<sup>22</sup> There is no darkness nor shadow of death where the workers of wickedness hide themselves.

<sup>23</sup> For He sets a man no stated time to appear before Ĕl in right-ruling.

<sup>24</sup> He breaks in pieces the mighty, without inquiry, and puts others in their place.

<sup>25</sup> Truly, He knows their works, and He shall overthrow in the night, and they are crushed.

<sup>26</sup> As wrong ones He slaps them in the presence of onlookers,

<sup>27</sup> because they turned from following Him, and they regarded not all His ways,

<sup>28</sup> so as to cause the cry of the poor to come to Him; for He hears the cry of the afflicted.

<sup>29</sup> And when He is silent, who would then condemn? And when He hides His face, who then sees Him, whether it is against a nation or a man alone?

<sup>30</sup> So that a defiled one should not reign, lest the people be ensnared.

<sup>31</sup> For has anyone said to Ĕl, ‘I have taken away, I do not act corruptly.

<sup>32</sup> ‘Teach me what I do not see. If I have done unrighteousness, I shall not do so again’?

<sup>33</sup> Should He repay you because you have refused? For you choose, and not I, therefore speak what you know.

<sup>34</sup> Let men of heart say to me, and a wise man who listens to me:

<sup>35</sup> ‘Iyoḇ does not speak with knowledge, and his words are without wisdom.’

<sup>36</sup> Would that Iyoḇ be tried to the end, since his answers are like those of wicked men!

<sup>37</sup> For he adds rebellion to his sin – he claps his hands among us, and multiplies his words against Ĕl.”

<sup>1</sup> Then Elihu responded and said,

<sup>2</sup> “Hear my words, you wise men; give ear to me, you who have knowledge.
