<sup>1</sup> “My spirit has been broken, my days have been extinguished, graves are for me.

<sup>2</sup> Truly, mockeries are with me, and my eye rests on their insults!

<sup>3</sup> Please lay down a pledge for me with Yourself. Who would strike hands with me?

<sup>4</sup> For You have hidden their heart from understanding, therefore You do not exalt them.

<sup>5</sup> He who denounces friends for a share, even the eyes of his children shall fail.

<sup>6</sup> But He has made me a byword of the people, whereas in former times I was as a drum.

<sup>7</sup> And from sorrow my eye has grown dim, and all my members are like shadows.

<sup>8</sup> Upright ones are astonished at this, and the innocent stirs himself up against the defiled one.

<sup>9</sup> And the righteous holds to his way, and he who has clean hands becomes stronger and stronger.

<sup>10</sup> But please, come back again, all of you, for I do not find a wise one among you.

<sup>11</sup> My days have passed by, my plans have been broken off – the desires of my heart.

<sup>12</sup> They would turn night into day, saying that light is near, in the presence of darkness!

<sup>13</sup> If I wait – the grave is my house, I shall make my bed in darkness,

<sup>14</sup> I shall say to corruption, ‘You are my father,’ – to the worm, ‘You are my mother and my sister.’

<sup>15</sup> Where then is my expectancy? As for my expectancy, who would see it?

<sup>16</sup> Would it sink down into the grave? Would we together go down into the dust?”
