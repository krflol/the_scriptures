<sup>1</sup> And Iyoḇ again took up his discourse, and said,

<sup>2</sup> “As Ĕl lives, who has turned aside my right-ruling, and the Almighty, who has made my life bitter,

<sup>3</sup> as long as my breath is in me, and the spirit of Eloah in my nostrils,

<sup>4</sup> my lips do not speak unrighteousness, nor my tongue utter deceit.

<sup>5</sup> Far be it from me that I grant that you are right. Until I die I would not turn aside my integrity from me.

<sup>6</sup> My righteousness I hold fast, and I do not let it go. My heart does not reproach me as long as I live.

<sup>7</sup> Let my enemy be like the wrongdoer, and he who rises up against me like the unrighteous.

<sup>8</sup> For what is the expectancy of the defiled one, when He does cut off, when Eloah takes away his life?

<sup>9</sup> Would Ĕl hear his cry when distress comes upon him?

<sup>10</sup> Would he delight himself in the Almighty – call on Eloah at all times?

<sup>11</sup> Let me teach you by the hand of Ĕl, that which is with the Almighty I do not hide.

<sup>12</sup> See, all of you have seen it. Why then are you altogether vain?

<sup>13</sup> This is the portion of a wrong man with Ĕl, and the inheritance of cruel ones, which they receive from the Almighty:

<sup>14</sup> If his children are increased, it is for the sword; and his offspring shall not have enough to eat.

<sup>15</sup> Those who remain of him are buried in death, and their widows do not weep.

<sup>16</sup> Though he heaps up silver like dust, and lays up garments like clay –

<sup>17</sup> he lays up, but the righteous puts it on, and the innocent divides the silver.

<sup>18</sup> He built his house like a moth, like a booth which a watchman made.

<sup>19</sup> He lies down, a rich man, but he is not gathered. When he opens his eyes, it is no more!

<sup>20</sup> Alarms overtake him like a flood; a storm wind shall steal him away in the night.

<sup>21</sup> The east wind takes him away, and he is gone; for it sweeps him from his place.

<sup>22</sup> And it hurls itself against him and does not spare; he swiftly flees from its power.

<sup>23</sup> It claps its hands at him, and it hisses him out of his place.
