<sup>1</sup> “Man born of woman is of few days and turmoil-filled.

<sup>2</sup> He comes forth like a flower and withers. He flees like a shadow and does not continue.

<sup>3</sup> Yet on such a one You open Your eyes, and bring me to right-ruling with Yourself!

<sup>4</sup> Who brings the clean out of the unclean? No one!

<sup>5</sup> Since his days are decided, the number of his months is with You, You have appointed his bounds which he does not pass over.

<sup>6</sup> Look away from him and let him rest, till like a hired man he enjoys his day.

<sup>7</sup> For there is expectancy for a tree, if it is cut down, that it does sprout again, and that its tender branch does not cease.

<sup>8</sup> Though its root grows old in the earth, and its stump dies in the ground,

<sup>9</sup> at the scent of water it buds and brings forth foliage like a plant.

<sup>10</sup> But man dies and is powerless, and man expires, and where is he?

<sup>11</sup> Water disappears from the sea, and a river dries up and is parched,

<sup>12</sup> and man shall lie down and not rise. Till the heavens are no more, they awake not, nor are aroused from their sleep.

<sup>13</sup> If only You would hide me in the grave, conceal me until Your wrath turns away. Set me a time, and remember me!

<sup>14</sup> If a man dies, would he live again? All the days of my struggle I wait, till my change comes.

<sup>15</sup> You would call, and I would answer You. You have yearned for the work of Your hands.

<sup>16</sup> For now You count my steps – do You not watch over my sin?

<sup>17</sup> My transgression is sealed up in a bag, and You cover over my crookedness.

<sup>18</sup> But a falling mountain crumbles away, and a rock is moved from its place,

<sup>19</sup> as water wears away stones, its out-pouring washes away the soil of the earth – so You have destroyed the expectancy of man.

<sup>20</sup> You overpower him, forever, and he is gone – his face changes and You send him away.

<sup>21</sup> His sons come to esteem, and he does not know it. And they are brought low, and he does not perceive it.

<sup>22</sup> He feels only the pain of his flesh, and he mourns over himself.”
