<sup>1</sup> And Bildaḏ the Shuḥite answered and said,

<sup>2</sup> “How long are you going to speak like this, since the words of your mouth are a strong wind?

<sup>3</sup> Does Ĕl twist right-ruling? Or does the Almighty twist what is right?

<sup>4</sup> If your sons have sinned against Him, and He delivers them into the hand of their transgression,

<sup>5</sup> if you diligently seek Ĕl and plead with the Almighty,

<sup>6</sup> if you were clear and straight, then indeed He would awake for you, and shall bless your righteous dwelling place.

<sup>7</sup> Though your beginning was small, yet your latter end would greatly increase.

<sup>8</sup> Indeed, please ask the former generation, and prepare for the research of their fathers,

<sup>9</sup> for we are but of yesterday, and know not, because our days on earth are as a shadow.

<sup>10</sup> Do they not teach you, speak to you, and bring forth words from their heart?

<sup>11</sup> Does papyrus grow without a marsh, a reed thrive without water?

<sup>12</sup> While it is yet green, not cut down, it dries out before any plant.

<sup>13</sup> So are the paths of all who forget Ĕl, and the expectancy of a defiled one does perish,

<sup>14</sup> whose refuge is cut off, and whose trust is a spider’s web.

<sup>15</sup> He leans on his house, but it does not stand. He holds it fast, but it does not last.

<sup>16</sup> He is moist before the sun, and his branches spread out in his garden.

<sup>17</sup> His roots wrap around a heap, and look for a place in the stones.

<sup>18</sup> If he is destroyed from his place, then it shall deny him: ‘I have not seen you.’

<sup>19</sup> See, this is the joy of His way, and out of the dust others grow.

<sup>20</sup> See, Ĕl does not cast away the perfect, neither hold the hand of evil-doers.

<sup>21</sup> While He fills your mouth with laughter, and your lips with rejoicing,

<sup>22</sup> those hating you put on shame, and the tent of the wrong is no more.”
