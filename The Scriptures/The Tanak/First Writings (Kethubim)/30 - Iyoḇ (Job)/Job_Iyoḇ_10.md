<sup>1</sup> “My being has grown weary of life. I let loose my complaint, I speak in the bitterness of my being.

<sup>2</sup> I say to Eloah, ‘Do not declare me wrong, show me why You strive with me.

<sup>3</sup> Is it good to You that You should crush, that You should despise the work of Your hands, and shine on the counsel of the wrong?

<sup>4</sup> Do You have eyes of flesh? Do You see as man sees?

<sup>5</sup> Are Your days like the days of a mortal man? Are Your years like the days of a mighty man,

<sup>6</sup> that You should seek for my crookedness and search out my sin?

<sup>7</sup> For You know that I am not wrong, and there is no one to deliver from Your hand.

<sup>8</sup> Your hands have made me and shaped me, together all around, yet You destroy me.

<sup>9</sup> Remember, please, that You have made me like clay. And would You turn me into dust again?

<sup>10</sup> Did You not pour me out like milk, and curdle me like cheese?

<sup>11</sup> Skin and flesh you put on me, and wove me with bones and sinews.

<sup>12</sup> Life and kindness You have bestowed on me, and Your visitation has preserved my spirit.

<sup>13</sup> And these You have laid up in Your heart, I know that this was with You:

<sup>14</sup> If I sin, then You watch me, and let no crookedness of mine go unpunished.

<sup>15</sup> If I am wrong, woe to me! And if I am righteous, I would not lift up my head – filled with shame and seeing my grief!

<sup>16</sup> If I lift it up high, you hunt me as a lion, and again You would show Yourself marvellous against me.

<sup>17</sup> You renew Your witnesses against me, and increase Your vexation toward me; changes and a host are with me.

<sup>18</sup> So why have You brought me forth from the womb? Oh, that I had perished and no eye had seen me!

<sup>19</sup> I should have been as though I had not been – brought from the womb to the grave.

<sup>20</sup> Are not my days few? Then cease! Leave me alone, so that I brighten up a little,

<sup>21</sup> Before I go, and not return, to the land of darkness and the shadow of death,

<sup>22</sup> a land as dark as darkness itself, as the shadow of death, without any order, whose light is as darkness.”
