<sup>1</sup> Then Tsophar the Na‛amathite answered and said,

<sup>2</sup> “Truly, my thoughts make me respond, even because of my haste within me.

<sup>3</sup> I have listened to the reproof which insults me, and the spirit of my understanding makes me answer.

<sup>4</sup> You have known this of old, since man was placed on earth,

<sup>5</sup> that the singing of the wrong is short-lived, and the joy of the defiled one is but for a moment?

<sup>6</sup> Although his pride mounts up to the heavens, and his head does reach to the clouds,

<sup>7</sup> he perishes forever like his own dung. Those who have seen him say, ‘Where is he?’

<sup>8</sup> He flies away like a dream, and is not found. And he is driven away like a vision of the night.

<sup>9</sup> Eyes that saw him do so no more, nor does his place see him any more.

<sup>10</sup> His sons seek the favour of the poor, and his hands give back his wealth.

<sup>11</sup> His bones shall be filled with his youth, but it lies down with him in the dust.

<sup>12</sup> Though evil is sweet in his mouth, he hides it under his tongue,

<sup>13</sup> though he fondles it and does not forsake it, but still keeps it in his mouth,

<sup>14</sup> his food is turned in his stomach, the bitterness of cobras is in him.

<sup>15</sup> He has swallowed down riches, then vomits them up – Ĕl drives it out of his stomach.

<sup>16</sup> He sucks the poison of cobras; the tongue of the poisonous snake slays him.

<sup>17</sup> He looks not on streams, the rivers flowing with honey and cream.

<sup>18</sup> He is giving back what he laboured for, and does not eat it – like wealth from his trade, but he does not enjoy.

<sup>19</sup> For he has oppressed, he has forsaken the poor, he has seized a house which he did not build.

<sup>20</sup> For he shall not know ease in his innermost, neither save what he desires.

<sup>21</sup> There is no left-over after he has eaten, therefore his good does not last.

<sup>22</sup> With all his plenty he is in distress; the hand of every labourer comes against him.

<sup>23</sup> It shall be, at the filling of his stomach, that He casts on him His burning wrath, and rains it down on him while he is eating.

<sup>24</sup> He shall flee from the iron weapon, a bronze bow pierce him through.

<sup>25</sup> It is drawn, and comes out of the body, and the gleaming point comes out of his gall. Fears come upon him.

<sup>26</sup> All darkness waits for his treasures. A fire not blown consumes him, it destroys what remains in his tent.

<sup>27</sup> The heavens reveal his crookedness, and the earth rises up against him.

<sup>28</sup> The increase of his house departs, flowing away in the day of His wrath.

<sup>29</sup> This is the portion from Elohim for a wrong man, and the heritage Ĕl has decreed for him.”
