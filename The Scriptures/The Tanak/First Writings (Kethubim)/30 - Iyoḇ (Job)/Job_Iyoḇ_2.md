<sup>1</sup> Again the day came to be that the sons of Elohim came to present themselves before יהוה, and Satan also came among them to present himself before יהוה.

<sup>2</sup> And יהוה said to Satan, “From where do you come?” And Satan answered יהוה and said, “From diligently searching in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.”

<sup>3</sup> And יהוה said to Satan, “Have you considered My servant Iyoḇ, that there is none like him on the earth, a perfect and straight man, one who fears Elohim and turns aside from evil? And still he holds fast to his integrity, although you incited Me against him, to destroy him without cause.”

<sup>4</sup> And Satan answered יהוה and said, “Skin for skin, and all that a man has he would give for his life!

<sup>5</sup> “But stretch out Your hand, please, and strike his bone and his flesh – if he would not curse You to Your face!”

<sup>6</sup> And יהוה said to Satan, “See, he is in your hand, only spare his life.”

<sup>7</sup> And Satan went out from the presence of יהוה, and smote Iyoḇ with loathsome sores from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head.

<sup>8</sup> And he took a potsherd with which to scrape himself while he sat in the midst of the ashes.

<sup>9</sup> And his wife said to him, “Do you still hold fast to your integrity? Curse Elohim and die!”

<sup>10</sup> But he said to her, “You speak as one of the foolish women speaks. Indeed, should we accept only good from Elohim, and not accept evil?” In all this Iyoḇ did not sin with his lips.

<sup>11</sup> And three of the friends of Iyoḇ heard of all this evil that came on him, and each one came from his own place – Eliphaz the Tĕmanite, and Bildaḏ the Shuḥite, and Tsophar the Na‛amathite – and they met together to come to sympathise with him and to comfort him.

<sup>12</sup> And they lifted up their eyes from a distance, and did not recognise him, and they lifted their voices and wept. And each one tore his robe and sprinkled dust on his head toward the heavens.

<sup>13</sup> Then they sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that the pain was very great.
