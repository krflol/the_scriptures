<sup>1</sup> “Do you know the time when the wild mountain goats bear young? Or do you observe when the deer gives birth?

<sup>2</sup> Do you number the months they complete? Or do you know the time when they bear young?

<sup>3</sup> They bow down, they bring forth their young, their labour pains are ended.

<sup>4</sup> Their young ones are thriving, they grow up in the field. They shall leave and shall not return to them.

<sup>5</sup> Who set the wild donkey free? Who loosed the bonds of the wild donkey,

<sup>6</sup> whose home I have made the desert, and the salt land his dwelling?

<sup>7</sup> He laughs at the commotion of the city; he does not hear the shouts of the driver.

<sup>8</sup> The range of the mountains is his pasture, and he searches for all that is green.

<sup>9</sup> Would the wild ox be pleased to serve you? Or spend the night by your feeding trough?

<sup>10</sup> If you bind the wild ox in the furrow with ropes, would he plough the valleys behind you?

<sup>11</sup> Would you rely on his great strength? Or would you leave your labour to him?

<sup>12</sup> Would you trust him to bring home your grain, and gather it to your threshing-floor?

<sup>13</sup> The wings of the ostrich flap joyously, but they are not the pinions and plumage of kindness!

<sup>14</sup> She leaves her eggs on the ground, and warms them in the dust;

<sup>15</sup> and she forgets that a foot might crush them, or a wild beast tread on them.

<sup>16</sup> She treats her young harshly, as if not hers; her toil is in vain, without fear,

<sup>17</sup> because Eloah has made her forget wisdom, and did not endow her with understanding.

<sup>18</sup> When she lifts herself on high, she laughs at the horse and its rider.

<sup>19</sup> Have you given the horse strength? Have you covered his neck with a mane?

<sup>20</sup> Would you make him leap like a locust? His splendid snorting is frightening.

<sup>21</sup> He paws in the valley, and rejoices in strength. He gallops into the clash of arms.

<sup>22</sup> He laughs at fear, and is not frightened; nor does he turn back from the sword.

<sup>23</sup> The quiver rattles against him, the glittering spear and lance.

<sup>24</sup> He eats up the ground with fierceness and rage, and he does not stand still when the ram’s horn sounds.

<sup>25</sup> At the blast of the ram’s horn he says, ‘Aha!’ And from afar he smells the battle, the thunder of commanders and shouting.

<sup>26</sup> Does the hawk fly by your wisdom, spreading its wings toward the south?

<sup>27</sup> Does the eagle mount up at your command, and make its nest on high?

<sup>28</sup> It dwells on the rock, and lodges on the crag of the rock and the stronghold.

<sup>29</sup> From there it searches out the prey, its eyes see it from afar.

<sup>30</sup> And its young ones suck up blood. And where the slain are, there it is!”
