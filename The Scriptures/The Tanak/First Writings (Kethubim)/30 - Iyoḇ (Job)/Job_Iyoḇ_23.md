<sup>1</sup> And Iyoḇ answered and said,

<sup>2</sup> “Even today my complaint is bitter; my hand is heavy on account of my groaning.

<sup>3</sup> If only I knew where to find Him, I would come to His dwelling-place!

<sup>4</sup> I would present my case before Him, and fill my mouth with proofs.

<sup>5</sup> I would know the words which He would answer me, and understand what He would say to me.

<sup>6</sup> Would He contend with me in great power? No! But He would pay attention to me.

<sup>7</sup> There the upright might reason with Him, and I would go safe forever from my Judge.

<sup>8</sup> See, I go forward, but He is not; and backward, but I do not perceive Him;

<sup>9</sup> to the left where He is working, but I do not see; He turns to the right, but I do not see.

<sup>10</sup> For He knows the way that I take. When He has tried me, I would come forth as gold.

<sup>11</sup> My foot has held fast to His steps. I have guarded His way, and did not turn aside.

<sup>12</sup> I have not strayed from the command of His lips. I have treasured the words of His mouth more than my daily portion.

<sup>13</sup> But He is One, and who does turn Him? And He does whatever His being has desired.

<sup>14</sup> For He completes my portion, and many like these are with Him.

<sup>15</sup> Therefore I am troubled at His presence; I consider, and I am afraid of Him.

<sup>16</sup> For Ĕl has made me faint-hearted, and the Almighty has alarmed me;

<sup>17</sup> because I was not cut off before darkness, and from my face He has covered the thick darkness.
