<sup>1</sup> The wrong shall flee though no one pursues, But the righteous are as bold as a lion.

<sup>2</sup> Because of transgression of a land, Many are its rulers; But by a man of understanding and knowledge, Right is maintained.

<sup>3</sup> A poor man who oppresses the poor Is like a sweeping rain that leaves no food.

<sup>4</sup> Those who forsake the Torah praise the wrong, Those who guard the Torah strive with them.

<sup>5</sup> Evil men do not understand right-ruling, But those who seek יהוה understand all.

<sup>6</sup> Better is the poor who walks in his integrity Than one perverse in his ways, who is rich.

<sup>7</sup> He who watches over the Torah is a discerning son, But a companion of gluttons shames his father.

<sup>8</sup> He who increases his possessions by interest and profit Gathers it for him who shows favour to the poor.

<sup>9</sup> He who turns away his ear from hearing the Torah, Even his prayer is an abomination.

<sup>10</sup> He who causes the straight to go astray in an evil way, Falls into his own pit; But the perfect inherit the good.

<sup>11</sup> A rich man is wise in his own eyes, But the poor who has understanding searches him out.

<sup>12</sup> When the righteous exult, there is great comeliness; But when the wrong arise, a man is searched for.

<sup>13</sup> He who hides his transgressions does not prosper, But he who confesses and forsakes them finds compassion.

<sup>14</sup> Blessed is the man who always fears Elohim, But he who hardens his heart falls into evil.

<sup>15</sup> A roaring lion and a charging bear Is a wrongdoing ruler over poor people.

<sup>16</sup> A leader who lacks understanding is a great oppressor, But the hater of greed prolongs his days.

<sup>17</sup> A man oppressed by blood-guilt flees into a pit; Let no one help him.

<sup>18</sup> He who walks blamelessly is saved, But the perverted of ways falls at once.

<sup>19</sup> He who tills his land is satisfied with bread, But he who pursues vanities is filled with poverty.

<sup>20</sup> A man of truth has many blessings, But one in a hurry to be rich does not go unpunished.

<sup>21</sup> To show partiality is not good, Because for a piece of bread a man would transgress.

<sup>22</sup> A man with an evil eye runs after wealth, And does not know that poverty awaits him.

<sup>23</sup> He who reproves a man finds more favour afterward Than he who flatters with the tongue.

<sup>24</sup> He who robs his father or his mother, And says, “It is no transgression,” He is a companion to a destroyer.

<sup>25</sup> He who is greedy stirs up strife, But he who trusts in יהוה prospers.

<sup>26</sup> He who trusts in his own heart is a fool, But he who walks wisely is delivered.

<sup>27</sup> He who gives to the poor does not lack, But he who hides his eyes does have many curses.

<sup>28</sup> When the wrong rise up, men hide themselves; But when they perish, the righteous increase.
