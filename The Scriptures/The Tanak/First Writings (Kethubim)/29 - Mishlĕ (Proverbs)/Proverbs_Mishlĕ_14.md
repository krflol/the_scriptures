<sup>1</sup> Every wise woman has built her house, But the foolish breaks it down with her hands.

<sup>2</sup> He who walks in his straightness fears יהוה, But he whose ways are crooked despises Him.

<sup>3</sup> In the mouth of a fool is a rod of pride, But the lips of the wise guard them.

<sup>4</sup> Where there are no oxen, the crib is clean; But from the strength of an ox comes much increase.

<sup>5</sup> A trustworthy witness does not lie, But a false witness breathes out lies.

<sup>6</sup> A scoffer shall seek wisdom but find none, But knowledge is swift to him who has understanding.

<sup>7</sup> Leave the presence of a foolish man, For you shall not perceive the lips of knowledge.

<sup>8</sup> The wisdom of the clever is to understand His way, But the folly of fools is deceit.

<sup>9</sup> Fools scoff at guilt, But among the straight there is delight.

<sup>10</sup> The heart knows its own bitterness, And no stranger shares its joy.

<sup>11</sup> The house of the wrong is destroyed, But the tent of the straight flourishes.

<sup>12</sup> There is a way which seems right to a man, But its end is the way of death.

<sup>13</sup> Even in laughter the heart is in pain, And the end of that joy is heaviness.

<sup>14</sup> The backslider in heart is satisfied with his own ways, But a good man is satisfied from his.

<sup>15</sup> The simple believes every word, But the clever one watches his step.

<sup>16</sup> The wise fears and turns away from evil, But a fool rushes on and is reckless.

<sup>17</sup> He who is impatient acts foolishly, And a man who plans wickedness is hated.

<sup>18</sup> The simple shall inherit folly, But the clever are crowned with knowledge.

<sup>19</sup> The evil ones shall bow before the good, And the wrong ones at the gates of the righteous.

<sup>20</sup> The poor is hated even by his own neighbour, But the rich has many friends.

<sup>21</sup> He who despises his neighbour sins; But he who shows favour to the poor, O blessed is he.

<sup>22</sup> Do not those who plan evil go astray? But kindness and truth are to those who plan good.

<sup>23</sup> In all labour there is profit, But talk of the lips leads only to poverty.

<sup>24</sup> The crown of the wise is their wealth, The folly of fools is folly.

<sup>25</sup> A true witness saves lives, But he who breathes out lies is a betrayer.

<sup>26</sup> In the fear of יהוה is strong trust, And His children have a place of refuge.

<sup>27</sup> The fear of יהוה is a fountain of life, To turn away from the snares of death.

<sup>28</sup> In a multitude of people Is a sovereign’s splendour, But in the lack of people Is the ruin of a prince.

<sup>29</sup> He who is patient has great understanding, But he who is short of spirit exalts folly.

<sup>30</sup> A healthy heart is life to the body, But envy is rottenness to the bones.

<sup>31</sup> He who oppresses the poor reproaches his Maker, But he who esteems Him shows favour to the needy.

<sup>32</sup> By his own evildoing the wrong is thrust down, But the righteous has a refuge in his death.

<sup>33</sup> Wisdom rests in the heart of him who has understanding, And even among fools it becomes known.

<sup>34</sup> Righteousness exalts a nation, But sin is a reproach to peoples.

<sup>35</sup> The sovereign’s delight is toward a wise servant, But his wrath is towards him who causes shame.
