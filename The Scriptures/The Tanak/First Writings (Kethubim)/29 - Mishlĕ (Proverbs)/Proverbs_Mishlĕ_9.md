<sup>1</sup> Wisdom has built her house, She has hewn out its seven columns,

<sup>2</sup> She has slaughtered her meat, She has mixed her wine, She has also prepared her table.

<sup>3</sup> She has sent out her young women, She cries out from the highest places of the city:

<sup>4</sup> “Who is simple? Let him turn in here!” As for him who lacks heart, she says to him,

<sup>5</sup> “Come, eat of my bread and drink of the wine I have mixed.”

<sup>6</sup> Leave the simple ones and live, And walk in the way of understanding.

<sup>7</sup> He who reproves a scoffer gets shame for himself, And he who rebukes a wrong one gets himself a blemish.

<sup>8</sup> Do not reprove a scoffer, lest he hate you; Reprove a wise one, and he loves you.

<sup>9</sup> Give instruction to a wise one, and he is wiser still; Teach a righteous one, and he increases in learning.

<sup>10</sup> The fear of יהוה is the beginning of wisdom, And the knowledge of the Set-apart One is understanding.

<sup>11</sup> For by me your days become many, And years of life are added to you.

<sup>12</sup> If you have become wise, You have become wise for yourself, And if you have scoffed, You alone bear it.

<sup>13</sup> A foolish woman is loud, Simple, and without knowledge.

<sup>14</sup> For she has seated herself At the door of her house, On a seat by the highest places of the city,

<sup>15</sup> To call to those who pass by, Who go straight on their way:

<sup>16</sup> “Who is simple? Let him turn in here.” And as for him who lacks heart, she says to him,

<sup>17</sup> “Stolen waters are sweet, And bread eaten in secret is pleasant.”

<sup>18</sup> But he does not know that the dead are there, Her guests are in the depths of the grave.
