<sup>1</sup> The sovereign’s heart is as channels of water In the hand of יהוה ; He turns it wherever He wishes.

<sup>2</sup> All a man’s ways are right in his own eyes, But יהוה weighs the hearts.

<sup>3</sup> To do righteousness and right-ruling Is more acceptable to יהוה than a slaughtering.

<sup>4</sup> A haughty look, a proud heart, The lamp of the wrong, are sin.

<sup>5</sup> The plans of the hard worker lead only to plenty, But all rash haste only to poverty.

<sup>6</sup> Gaining treasures by a lying tongue Is a fleeting vapour, heading for death.

<sup>7</sup> The spoil of the wrong catches them, Because they refused to do right- ruling.

<sup>8</sup> The way of a guilty man is perverse; But as for the innocent, his work is right.

<sup>9</sup> It is better to dwell in a corner of a roof, Than in a house shared with a contentious woman.

<sup>10</sup> The desire of the wrong is set upon evil; His neighbour finds no favour in his eyes.

<sup>11</sup> When the scoffer is punished, the simple is made wise; But when the wise is instructed, he receives knowledge.

<sup>12</sup> The Righteous One observes the house of the wrong; He overthrows the wrong for their evil.

<sup>13</sup> Whoever shuts his ears to the cry of the poor, Let him also cry and not be heard.

<sup>14</sup> A gift in secret subdues displeasure, And a bribe in the bosom, strong wrath.

<sup>15</sup> To do right-ruling is joy to the righteous, But ruin to the workers of wickedness.

<sup>16</sup> A man who strays from the way of understanding, Rests in the assembly of the dead.

<sup>17</sup> He who loves pleasure is a poor man; He who loves wine and oil does not become rich.

<sup>18</sup> The wrong is a ransom for the righteous, And the treacherous for the straight.

<sup>19</sup> It is better to dwell in the wilderness, Than with a contentious and vexed woman.

<sup>20</sup> Desirable treasure and oil, Are in the dwelling of the wise, But a foolish man swallows it up.

<sup>21</sup> He who pursues righteousness and kindness Finds life, righteousness and esteem.

<sup>22</sup> A wise one scales the city of the mighty, And brings down the trusted stronghold.

<sup>23</sup> Whoever guards his mouth and tongue Guards his life from distresses.

<sup>24</sup> Proud, haughty, “Scoffer” is his name; He acts with arrogant pride.

<sup>25</sup> The desire of the lazy man slays him, For his hands refused to work.

<sup>26</sup> He covets greedily all day long, But the righteous gives and does not withhold.

<sup>27</sup> The slaughtering of the wrong is an abomination; How much more when he brings it with wickedness!

<sup>28</sup> A false witness perishes, But the man who obeys speaks forever.

<sup>29</sup> A wrong man hardens his face, But as for the straight, he establishes his way.

<sup>30</sup> There is no wisdom or understanding Or counsel against יהוה.

<sup>31</sup> The horse is prepared for the day of battle, But the deliverance is of יהוה.
