<sup>1</sup> Better is the poor walking in his integrity Than one of perverse lips, who is a fool.

<sup>2</sup> Also, desire without knowledge is not good; And he who hurries with his feet sins.

<sup>3</sup> The foolishness of a man perverts his way, And his heart is wroth against יהוה.

<sup>4</sup> Wealth adds many friends, But the poor is separated from his friend.

<sup>5</sup> A false witness does not go unpunished, And he who breaths out lies does not escape.

<sup>6</sup> Many entreat the favour of the noble. And all are friends to him who gives gifts.

<sup>7</sup> All the brothers of the poor shall hate him; How much more shall his friends go far from him! He pursues promises – they are gone!.

<sup>8</sup> He who gets heart loves his own life; He who guards understanding finds good.

<sup>9</sup> A false witness does not go unpunished, And he who breathes out lies perishes.

<sup>10</sup> Luxury is not fitting for a fool, Much less for a servant to rule over princes.

<sup>11</sup> A man’s discretion makes him patient, And his adorning is to pass over a transgression.

<sup>12</sup> The sovereign’s wrath is like the roaring of a lion, But his delight is like dew on the grass.

<sup>13</sup> A foolish son is a calamity to his father, And the contentions of a wife are a continual dripping.

<sup>14</sup> Houses and riches are the inheritance from fathers, But an understanding wife is from יהוה.

<sup>15</sup> Laziness makes one fall into a deep sleep, And an idle being suffers hunger.

<sup>16</sup> He who guards the command guards his life, He who despises His ways dies.

<sup>17</sup> He who shows favour to the poor lends to יהוה, And He repays his deed.

<sup>18</sup> Discipline your son because there is expectation, And do not set your being on his destruction.

<sup>19</sup> One of great wrath bears punishment; For if you rescue him, You only have to do it again.

<sup>20</sup> Listen to counsel and accept discipline, So that you are wise in your latter end.

<sup>21</sup> Many are the plans in a man’s heart, But it is the counsel of יהוה that stands.

<sup>22</sup> What is desirable in a man is his kindness, And a poor man is better than a liar.

<sup>23</sup> The fear of יהוה leads to life, And he remains satisfied, He is not visited by evil.

<sup>24</sup> A lazy one buries his hand in a dish, And does not bring it back to his mouth.

<sup>25</sup> Beat a scoffer, and the simple is made wise; And reprove one who has understanding, And he discerns knowledge.

<sup>26</sup> He who plunders a father, Chases away his mother, Is a son causing shame and bringing reproach.

<sup>27</sup> Cease, my son, to hear discipline, And you shall stray from the words of knowledge.

<sup>28</sup> A witness of Beliya‛al scorns right-ruling, And the mouth of the wrong ones Devours wickedness.

<sup>29</sup> Judgments are in store for scoffers, And beatings for the backs of fools.
