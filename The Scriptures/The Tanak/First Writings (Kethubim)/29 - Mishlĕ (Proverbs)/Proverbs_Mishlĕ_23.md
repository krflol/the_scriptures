<sup>1</sup> When you sit down to eat with a ruler, Look well what is before you;

<sup>2</sup> And put a knife to your throat If you are a man given to appetite.

<sup>3</sup> Do not desire his delicacies, For that food is deceptive.

<sup>4</sup> Do not labour to be rich. Cease from your own understanding!

<sup>5</sup> Do you set your eyes on that which is not? For riches certainly make themselves wings; They fly away like an eagle to the heavens.

<sup>6</sup> Do not eat the bread of one having an evil eye, Nor desire his delicacies;

<sup>7</sup> For as he reckons in his life, so is he. “Eat and drink!” he says to you, But his heart is not with you.

<sup>8</sup> You vomit the piece you have eaten, And lose your sweet words.

<sup>9</sup> Do not speak in the ears of a fool, For he treads on the wisdom of your words.

<sup>10</sup> Do not move the ancient boundary, And do not enter the fields of the fatherless;

<sup>11</sup> For their Redeemer is strong; He shall plead their cause against you.

<sup>12</sup> Bring your heart to discipline, And your ears to words of knowledge.

<sup>13</sup> Do not withhold discipline from a child; If you beat him with a rod, he does not die.

<sup>14</sup> Beat him with a rod And deliver his being from the grave.

<sup>15</sup> My son, if your heart shall be wise, My heart rejoices, even I,

<sup>16</sup> And my kidneys exult When your lips speak what is straight.

<sup>17</sup> Do not let your heart envy sinners, But be in the fear of יהוה all day long;

<sup>18</sup> For certain, there is a hereafter, And let your expectancy not be cut off.

<sup>19</sup> Hear, my son, and be wise, And guide your heart in the way.

<sup>20</sup> Be not among heavy drinkers of wine Or with gluttonous eaters of meat;

<sup>21</sup> For the drunkard and the glutton become poor, And slumber puts rags on a man.

<sup>22</sup> Listen to your father who brought you forth, And do not despise your mother when she is old.

<sup>23</sup> Buy the truth and do not sell it – Wisdom and discipline and understanding.

<sup>24</sup> The father of the righteous greatly rejoices, And he who brings forth a wise one delights in him.

<sup>25</sup> Let your father and your mother rejoice, And let her who bore you exult.

<sup>26</sup> My son, give me your heart, And let your eyes watch my ways.

<sup>27</sup> For a whore is a deep pit, And a strange woman is a narrow well.

<sup>28</sup> She too lies in wait as for a prey, And increases the treacherous among men.

<sup>29</sup> Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has contentions? Who has complaints? Who feels hurt without cause? Who has redness of eyes?

<sup>30</sup> Those staying long at the wine, Those going in to search out mixed wine.

<sup>31</sup> Do not look on the wine when it is red, When it gives its colour in the cup, As it flows smoothly;

<sup>32</sup> In the end it bites like a snake, And stings like an adder –

<sup>33</sup> Your eyes look on strange women, And your heart speaks perversities.

<sup>34</sup> And you shall be as one Lying down in the midst of the sea, And as one lying at the top of the mast, saying,

<sup>35</sup> “They smote me, I was not sick! They beat me, I did not know! When shall I wake up? Let me seek it again!”
