<sup>1</sup> My son, listen to my wisdom; Incline your ear to my understanding,

<sup>2</sup> So as to watch over discretion, And your lips guard knowledge.

<sup>3</sup> For the lips of a strange woman drip honey, And her mouth is smoother than oil;

<sup>4</sup> But in the end she is bitter as wormwood, Sharp as a two-edged sword.

<sup>5</sup> Her feet go down to death, Her steps lay hold of the grave.

<sup>6</sup> She does not consider the path of life; Her ways are unstable – you do not know it.

<sup>7</sup> So now, listen to me, you children, And do not turn away from the words of my mouth.

<sup>8</sup> Keep your way far from her, And do not come near the door of her house,

<sup>9</sup> Lest you give your splendour to others, And your years to one who is cruel;

<sup>10</sup> Lest strangers be filled with your strength, And your labours go to the house of a foreigner.

<sup>11</sup> Then you shall howl in your latter end, When your flesh and your body are consumed,

<sup>12</sup> And shall say, “How I have hated discipline, And my heart has despised reproof!

<sup>13</sup> “And I have not heeded the voice of my teachers, And I have not inclined my ear to those who instructed me!

<sup>14</sup> “In a little while I was in all evil, In the midst of an assembly and a congregation.”

<sup>15</sup> Drink water from your own cistern, And running water from your own well.

<sup>16</sup> Should your springs be scattered abroad, Rivers of water in the streets?

<sup>17</sup> And not for strangers with you.

<sup>18</sup> Let your fountain be blessed, And rejoice with the wife of your youth –

<sup>19</sup> A loving deer and a pleasant doe! Let her breasts satisfy you at all times. And be captivated by her love always.

<sup>20</sup> For why should you, my son, Be captivated by a strange woman, And embrace the bosom of a foreigner?

<sup>21</sup> For the ways of man Are before the eyes of יהוה, And He considers all his paths.

<sup>22</sup> The wrong one is entrapped In his own crookednesses, And he is caught in the cords of his sin.

<sup>23</sup> He dies for lack of discipline, And in the greatness of his folly He goes astray.
