<sup>1</sup> Whoever loves discipline loves knowledge, But he who hates reproof is stupid.

<sup>2</sup> The good obtains favour from יהוה, But the man of wicked devices He declares wrong.

<sup>3</sup> A man is not established by wrongness, But the root of the righteous shall not be moved.

<sup>4</sup> A capable wife is the crown of her husband, But one causing shame is like rottenness in his bones.

<sup>5</sup> The thoughts of the righteous are right-ruling, The counsels of the wrong are deceit.

<sup>6</sup> The words of the wrong are, “Lie in wait for blood,” But the mouth of the straight delivers them.

<sup>7</sup> The wrong are overthrown, And are no more, But the house of the righteous stands.

<sup>8</sup> A man is praised according to his wisdom, But the perverted of heart becomes despised.

<sup>9</sup> Better to be lightly esteemed and have a servant, Than the highly esteemed who lacks bread.

<sup>10</sup> The righteous regards the life of his beast, But the compassion of the wrong is cruelty.

<sup>11</sup> He who tills his land is satisfied with bread, But he who pursues vanities is lacking heart.

<sup>12</sup> The wrong shall covet the catch of evil-doers, But the root of the righteous yields fruit.

<sup>13</sup> In the transgression of the lips is an evil snare, But the righteous gets out of distress.

<sup>14</sup> From the fruit of his mouth one is filled with good, And the work of a man’s hands is given back to him.

<sup>15</sup> The way of a fool is right in his own eyes, But he who listens to advice is wise.

<sup>16</sup> A fool’s wrath is known at once, But a clever one covers shame.

<sup>17</sup> He who speaks truth declares righteousness, But a false witness, deceit.

<sup>18</sup> Rash speaking is like piercings of a sword, But the tongue of the wise is healing.

<sup>19</sup> The lip of truth is established forever, But a lying tongue is but for a moment.

<sup>20</sup> Deceit is in the heart of those who plot evil, But counsellors of peace have joy.

<sup>21</sup> No harm befalls the righteous, But the wrong shall be filled with evil.

<sup>22</sup> Lying lips are an abomination to יהוה, But those who deal truly are His delight.

<sup>23</sup> A clever man is concealing knowledge, But the heart of fools proclaims folly.

<sup>24</sup> The hand of the hard worker rules, But the lazy is put to compulsory labour.

<sup>25</sup> Anxiety in the heart of man causes depression, But a good word makes him glad.

<sup>26</sup> The righteous is a guide to his neighbour, But the way of the wrong leads them astray.

<sup>27</sup> The lazy one has no game to roast, But the hard worker prizes his possessions.

<sup>28</sup> In the way of righteousness is life, And in its pathway there is no death.
