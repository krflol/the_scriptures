<sup>1</sup> One often reproved, hardening his neck, Is suddenly broken, and there is no healing.

<sup>2</sup> When the righteous increase, the people rejoice; But when a wrong one rules, the people sigh.

<sup>3</sup> He who loves wisdom gladdens his father, But a companion of whores destroys wealth.

<sup>4</sup> A sovereign establishes a land by right-ruling, But one who receives bribes throws it down.

<sup>5</sup> A man who flatters his neighbour Spreads a net for his own feet.

<sup>6</sup> An evil man is ensnared by transgression, But the righteous sings and rejoices.

<sup>7</sup> The righteous knows the plea of the poor, The wrong does not understand such knowledge.

<sup>8</sup> Scoffers ensnare a city, But the wise turn away wrath.

<sup>9</sup> When a wise man disputes with a foolish man, Whether he rages or laughs, there is no peace.

<sup>10</sup> Bloodthirsty men hate the perfect, And seek the life of the straight.

<sup>11</sup> A fool lets out all his breath, But the wise calms it down.

<sup>12</sup> If a ruler listens to lying words, All his servants become wrong.

<sup>13</sup> The poor man and the oppressor have this in common: יהוה gives light to the eyes of both.

<sup>14</sup> The sovereign who rightly rules the poor with truth, His throne is established forever.

<sup>15</sup> A rod and reproof give wisdom, But a child unrestrained brings shame to his mother.

<sup>16</sup> When the wrong become many, transgression increases; But the righteous look on their fall.

<sup>17</sup> Discipline your son, And he brings you rest and delight to your life.

<sup>18</sup> Where there is no vision, the people are let loose, But blessed is he who guards the Torah.

<sup>19</sup> A servant is not disciplined by words; Though he understands, he does not respond.

<sup>20</sup> Have you seen a man hasty in his words? There is more expectancy for a fool than for him.

<sup>21</sup> He who deals tenderly With his servant from youth, Has him as a son in the end.

<sup>22</sup> A man of displeasure stirs up strife, And a master of rage has many a transgression.

<sup>23</sup> The pride of man brings him low, But the humble in spirit obtains esteem.

<sup>24</sup> He who shares with a thief hates his own life; He hears an oath, but does not report.

<sup>25</sup> The fear of man brings a snare, But whoever trusts in יהוה is set on high.

<sup>26</sup> Many seek the face of a ruler, But right-ruling for man comes from יהוה.

<sup>27</sup> An unrighteous man Is an abomination to the righteous, And he who is straight in the way Is an abomination to the wrong.
