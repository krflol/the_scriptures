<sup>1</sup> Does not wisdom call, And understanding lift up her voice?

<sup>2</sup> On the top of the heights along the way, Between the paths she has taken her stand.

<sup>3</sup> Beside the gates, leading to the city, At the entrances, she shouts:

<sup>4</sup> “O men, I call, to you, And my voice is to the sons of men.

<sup>5</sup> “You simple ones, understand insight, And you fools, be of an understanding heart.

<sup>6</sup> “Listen, for I speak noble words, And the opening of my lips is about straightness;

<sup>7</sup> “For my mouth speaks truth; And wrongness is an abomination to my lips.

<sup>8</sup> “All the words of my mouth are in righteousness, None of them twisted or crooked,

<sup>9</sup> “All of them plain to him who understands, And straight to those who find knowledge.

<sup>10</sup> “Accept my discipline, and not silver, And knowledge rather than choice gold;

<sup>11</sup> “For wisdom is better than rubies, And all delights are not comparable to her.

<sup>12</sup> “I, wisdom, have dwelt with insight, And I find knowledge, foresight.

<sup>13</sup> “The fear of יהוה is to hate evil. I have hated pride and arrogance, And the evil way, And the perverse mouth.

<sup>14</sup> “Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom; I am understanding, mightiness is mine.

<sup>15</sup> “By me sovereigns reign, And rulers make righteous decrees.

<sup>16</sup> “By me princes rule, and nobles, All the judges of the earth.

<sup>17</sup> “I love those who love me, And those who earnestly seek me do find me.

<sup>18</sup> “Riches and esteem are with me, Enduring wealth and righteousness.

<sup>19</sup> “My fruit is better than gold and fine gold, And my increase than choice silver.

<sup>20</sup> “I walk in the way of righteousness, In the midst of the paths of right- ruling,

<sup>21</sup> “To bestow substance on those who love me, And to fill their treasuries.

<sup>22</sup> “ יהוה possessed me, The beginning of His way, As the first of His works of old.

<sup>23</sup> “I was set up ages ago, at the first, Before the earth ever was.

<sup>24</sup> “When there were no depths I was brought forth, When there were no springs heavy with water.

<sup>25</sup> “Before mountains were sunk, Before the hills, I was brought forth,

<sup>26</sup> “Before He had made the earth and the fields, Or the first dust of the world.

<sup>27</sup> “When He prepared the heavens, I was there, When He decreed a vault on the face of the deep,

<sup>28</sup> “When He set the clouds above, When He made the fountains of the deep strong,

<sup>29</sup> “When He gave to the sea its limit, So that the waters would not transgress His command, When He decreed the foundations of the earth,

<sup>30</sup> “Then I was beside Him, a master workman, And I was His delight, day by day Rejoicing before Him all the time,

<sup>31</sup> “Rejoicing in the world, His earth; And my delights were with the sons of men.

<sup>32</sup> “And now, listen to me, you children, For blessed are they who guard my ways.

<sup>33</sup> “Listen to discipline and become wise, And do not refuse it.

<sup>34</sup> “Blessed is the man who listens to me, Watching daily at my gates, Waiting at the posts of my doors.

<sup>35</sup> “For whoever finds me shall find life, And obtain favour from יהוה,

<sup>36</sup> “But he who sins against me injures himself; All who hate me love death!”
