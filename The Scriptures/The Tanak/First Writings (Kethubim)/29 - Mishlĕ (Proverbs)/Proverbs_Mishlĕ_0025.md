<sup>1</sup> These too are proverbs of Shelomoh which the men of Ḥizqiyah sovereign of Yehuḏah copied:

<sup>2</sup> It is the esteem of Elohim to hide a matter, And the esteem of sovereigns to search out a matter.

<sup>3</sup> The heavens for height and the earth for depth, But the heart of sovereigns is unsearchable.

<sup>4</sup> Take away the dross from silver, And a vessel comes forth for the refiner.

<sup>5</sup> Take away the wrong from before the sovereign, And his throne is established in righteousness.

<sup>6</sup> Do not exalt yourself before a sovereign, And do not stand in the place of great men;

<sup>7</sup> For it is better for him to say to you, “Come up here,” Than that you should be put lower Before a noble whom your eyes have seen.

<sup>8</sup> Do not go forth to strive in haste, For what would you do in the end, When your neighbour has put you to shame?

<sup>9</sup> Plead your case with your neighbour himself, And do not disclose the secret of another;

<sup>10</sup> Lest he who hears it put you to shame, And your evil report turn not back.

<sup>11</sup> A word spoken at the right time Is like apples of gold in settings of silver.

<sup>12</sup> A ring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, Is a wise one’s reproof to an ear that hears.

<sup>13</sup> Like the cold of snow in time of harvest Is a trustworthy messenger to those who send him, For he refreshes the life of his masters.

<sup>14</sup> He who boasts of his gifts falsely Is like clouds and wind without rain.

<sup>15</sup> Through patience a ruler is persuaded, And a soft tongue shatters a bone.

<sup>16</sup> Have you found honey? Eat only as much as you need, Lest you be satisfied with it and vomit.

<sup>17</sup> Make your foot rare in your neighbour’s house, Lest he gets enough of you and hate you.

<sup>18</sup> A man bearing false witness against his neighbour Is like a club and a sword and a sharp arrow.

<sup>19</sup> Trust in a treacherous man in time of distress Is like a broken tooth or a foot out of joint.

<sup>20</sup> One who takes away a garment in cold weather, Is like vinegar on soda, And a singer of songs on an evil heart.

<sup>21</sup> If your enemy is hungry give him bread to eat, And if he is thirsty give him water to drink,

<sup>22</sup> For you are heaping coals of fire on his head, And יהוה rewards you.

<sup>23</sup> The north wind brings rain, And a secret tongue an enraged face.

<sup>24</sup> It is better to dwell in a corner of a roof, Than in a house shared with a contentious woman.

<sup>25</sup> Like cold water to a parched throat, Is good news from a distant land.

<sup>26</sup> A righteous man who gives way before the wrong, Is like a muddied spring and a ruined fountain.

<sup>27</sup> It is not good to eat much honey. Is it esteem to seek one’s own esteem?

<sup>28</sup> A man who has no control over his spirit Is like a broken-down city without a wall.
