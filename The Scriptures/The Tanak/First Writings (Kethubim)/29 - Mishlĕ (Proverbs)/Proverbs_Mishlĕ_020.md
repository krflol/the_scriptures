<sup>1</sup> Wine is a scoffer, strong drink a brawler, And whoever is led astray by it is not wise.

<sup>2</sup> The dread of a sovereign is like the roaring of a lion; Whoever provokes him sins against his own life.

<sup>3</sup> For a man to cease from strife is esteem, But every fool bursts out.

<sup>4</sup> The lazy one does not plough after the autumn; At harvest time he inquires – there is none!

<sup>5</sup> Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water, But a man of understanding draws it up.

<sup>6</sup> Most men proclaim each his own kindness, But who finds a trustworthy man?

<sup>7</sup> The righteous man walks in his integrity; His children are blessed after him.

<sup>8</sup> A sovereign who sits on the throne of judgment Is scattering all evil with his eyes.

<sup>9</sup> Who says, “I have cleansed my heart, I am purged of my sin”?

<sup>10</sup> Differing weights and differing measures, Both of them are an abomination to יהוה.

<sup>11</sup> Even a child is known by his deeds, Whether his work is clear and right.

<sup>12</sup> The hearing ear and the seeing eye, יהוה has made both of them.

<sup>13</sup> Do not love sleep, lest you become poor; Open your eyes, be satisfied with bread.

<sup>14</sup> “Evil! Evil!” cries the buyer; But when he has gone his way, then he boasts.

<sup>15</sup> There is gold and a multitude of rubies, But the lips of knowledge are a precious vessel.

<sup>16</sup> Take the garment of one who is guarantor for a stranger, And hold it as a pledge when it is for foreigners.

<sup>17</sup> Bread gained by deceit might be sweet to a man, But afterward his mouth is filled with gravel.

<sup>18</sup> By counsel plans are established; And by wise guidance wage a battle.

<sup>19</sup> He who goes about as a slanderer reveals secrets; Therefore do not associate with him Who speaks smoothly with his lips.

<sup>20</sup> Whoever curses his father or his mother, His lamp is put out in deep darkness.

<sup>21</sup> An inheritance obtained with greed at the beginning Is not blessed at the end.

<sup>22</sup> Do not say, “I repay evil.” Wait for יהוה, and He saves you.

<sup>23</sup> Differing weights are an abomination to יהוה, And a false scale is not good.

<sup>24</sup> The steps of a man are from יהוה ; What does a man know about his own way?

<sup>25</sup> It is a snare for a man to say rashly, “It is set-apart,” And only later to reconsider his vows.

<sup>26</sup> A wise sovereign winnows out the wrong, And turns the wheel over them.

<sup>27</sup> The spirit of a man is the lamp of יהוה, Searching all his inmost parts.

<sup>28</sup> Kindness and truth watch over the sovereign, And he shall support his throne by kindness.

<sup>29</sup> The comeliness of young men is their strength, And the splendour of old men is their grey hair.

<sup>30</sup> The blows that wound cleanse away evil, And strokes the inner parts of the heart.
