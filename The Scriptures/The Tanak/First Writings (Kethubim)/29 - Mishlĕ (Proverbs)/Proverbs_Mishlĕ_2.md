<sup>1</sup> My son, if you accept my words, And treasure up my commands with you,

<sup>2</sup> So that you make your ear attend to wisdom, Incline your heart to understanding;

<sup>3</sup> For if you cry for discernment, Lift up your voice for understanding,

<sup>4</sup> If you seek her as silver, And search for her as hidden treasures,

<sup>5</sup> Then you would understand the fear of יהוה, And find the knowledge of Elohim.

<sup>6</sup> For יהוה gives wisdom; Out of His mouth come knowledge and understanding.

<sup>7</sup> And He treasures up stability for the straight, A shield to those walking blamelessly,

<sup>8</sup> To watch over the paths of right-ruling, And the way of His kind ones He guards.

<sup>9</sup> Then you would understand righteousness And right-ruling, and straightness – Every good path.

<sup>10</sup> For wisdom would enter your heart, And knowledge be pleasant to your being,

<sup>11</sup> Discretion would guard you; Understanding would watch over you,

<sup>12</sup> To deliver you from the evil way, From the man who speaks perversities,

<sup>13</sup> Those who leave the paths of straightness To walk in the ways of darkness;

<sup>14</sup> Who rejoice to do evil; They delight in the perversities of evil;

<sup>15</sup> Whose paths are crooked, And they are perverted in their ways;

<sup>16</sup> To deliver you from the strange woman, From the foreigner who flatters with her words,

<sup>17</sup> Who forsakes the companion of her youth, And has forgotten the covenant of her Elohim.

<sup>18</sup> For her house has sunk down to death, And her paths to the dead;

<sup>19</sup> None going in to her does return, Nor do they reach the paths of life –

<sup>20</sup> So walk in the way of goodness, And guard the paths of righteousness.

<sup>21</sup> For the straight shall dwell in the earth, And the perfect be left in it;

<sup>22</sup> But the wrong shall be cut off from the earth, And the treacherous ones plucked out of it.
