<sup>1</sup> The words of Aḡur son of Yaqeh, a message. This man declared to Ithi’ĕl, to Ithi’ĕl and Uḵal:

<sup>2</sup> For I am more stupid than anyone, And do not have the understanding of a man.

<sup>3</sup> And I have not learned wisdom That I should know the knowledge of the Set-apart One.

<sup>4</sup> Who has gone up to the heavens and come down? Who has gathered the wind in His fists? Who has bound the waters in a garment? Who established all the ends of the earth? What is His Name, And what is His Son’s Name, If you know it?

<sup>5</sup> Every Word of Eloah is tried; He is a shield to those taking refuge in Him.

<sup>6</sup> Do not add to His Words, Lest He reprove you,

<sup>7</sup> Two matters I have asked of You – Deny them not to me before I die:

<sup>8</sup> Remove falsehood and a lying word far from me; Give me neither poverty nor riches; Feed me my portion of bread;

<sup>9</sup> Lest I become satisfied and deny You, And say, “Who is יהוה ?” And lest I be poor, and steal, And seize the Name of my Elohim.

<sup>10</sup> Do not slander a servant to his master, Lest he curse you, And you be found guilty.

<sup>11</sup> There is a generation that curses its father, And does not bless its mother –

<sup>12</sup> There is a generation, clean in its own eyes, But not washed from its own filth.

<sup>13</sup> There is a generation; Oh, how haughty are their eyes! And their eyelids are lifted up.

<sup>14</sup> There is a generation whose teeth are swords, And whose jaw-teeth are knives, To devour the poor from off the earth, And the needy from among men.

<sup>15</sup> The leech has two daughters: “Give! Give!” Three are not satisfied, Four that never say, “Enough”:

<sup>16</sup> The grave, and the barren womb, Soil not satisfied with water, And fire which never says, “Enough.”

<sup>17</sup> An eye that mocks his father, And scorns to obey his mother – Ravens of the wadi dig it out, And young eagles eat it!

<sup>18</sup> Three matters are too marvellous for me, And four which I do not understand:

<sup>19</sup> The way of an eagle in the heavens, The way of a snake on a rock, The way of a ship in the heart of the sea, And the way of a man with a girl.

<sup>20</sup> This is the way of an adulterous woman: She shall eat and wipe her mouth, and say, “I have not done wickedness.”

<sup>21</sup> Under three matters the earth trembles, And under four, it is unable to bear:

<sup>22</sup> Under a servant when he reigns, And a fool when he is satisfied with food,

<sup>23</sup> Under a hated woman who marries, And a female servant who supplants her mistress.

<sup>24</sup> There are four matters Which are little on the earth, But they are exceedingly wise:

<sup>25</sup> The ants are a people not strong, Yet they prepare their food in the summer;

<sup>26</sup> The rock badgers are a weak folk, Yet they make their homes in the crags;

<sup>27</sup> The locusts have no sovereign, Yet they all go out in formation;

<sup>28</sup> A spider takes hold with two hands, And is in sovereigns’ palaces.

<sup>29</sup> There are three matters That are going well, And four are good in walking:

<sup>30</sup> A lion, which is mighty among beasts And does not turn away from facing all;

<sup>31</sup> A greyhound, and a male goat, And a sovereign whose army is with him.

<sup>32</sup> If you have been foolish in lifting up yourself, Or if you have plotted evil, Put your hand on your mouth.

<sup>33</sup> For as milk under pressure brings forth curds, And as a nose under pressure brings forth blood, So wrath under pressure brings forth strife.
