<sup>1</sup> The proverbs of Shelomoh son of Dawiḏ, sovereign of Yisra’ĕl:

<sup>2</sup> For knowing wisdom and discipline, For understanding the words of understanding,

<sup>3</sup> For receiving the discipline of wisdom, Righteousness, right-ruling, and straightness;

<sup>4</sup> For giving insight to the simple, Knowledge and discretion to the young.

<sup>5</sup> The wise one hears and increases learning, And the understanding one gets wise counsel,

<sup>6</sup> For understanding a proverb and a figure, The words of the wise and their riddles.

<sup>7</sup> The fear of יהוה is the beginning of knowledge; Fools despise wisdom and discipline.

<sup>8</sup> My son, heed the discipline of your father, And do not forsake the Torah of your mother;

<sup>9</sup> For they are a fair wreath on your head, And chains about your neck.

<sup>10</sup> My son, if sinners entice you, do not give in.

<sup>11</sup> If they say, “Come with us, let us lie in wait for blood, Let us ambush the innocent without cause.

<sup>12</sup> “Let us swallow them alive like the grave, And entirely, like those going down to the pit.

<sup>13</sup> “Let us find all precious goods, Let us fill our houses with spoil.

<sup>14</sup> “Cast in your lot among us, Let us all have one purse,”

<sup>15</sup> My son, do not walk in the way with them, Keep your foot from their path;

<sup>16</sup> For their feet run to evil, And they hurry to shed blood.

<sup>17</sup> For in vain the net is spread In the sight of any bird.

<sup>18</sup> But they lie in wait for their own blood, They ambush their own lives.

<sup>19</sup> Such are the ways of everyone greedy for gain; It takes away the life of its owners.

<sup>20</sup> Wisdom calls aloud outside; She raises her voice in the broad places.

<sup>21</sup> At the head of the noisy streets she cries out, At the openings of the gates, In the city she speaks her words:

<sup>22</sup> “How long, you simple ones, Would you love simplicity, And shall scoffers delight in their scoffing, And fools hate knowledge?

<sup>23</sup> “Turn at my reproof. See, I pour out my spirit on you, I make my words known to you.

<sup>24</sup> “Because I called and you refused, I have stretched out my hand and no one inclined,

<sup>25</sup> “And you spurned all my counsel, And would not yield to my reproof,

<sup>26</sup> “Let me also laugh at your calamity, Mock when your dread comes,

<sup>27</sup> “When your dread comes like a storm, And your calamity comes like a whirlwind, When distress and anguish come upon you.

<sup>28</sup> “Let them then call on me, but I answer not; Let them seek me, but not find me.

<sup>29</sup> “Because they hated knowledge And did not choose the fear of יהוה,

<sup>30</sup> “They did not accept my counsel, They despised all my reproof,

<sup>31</sup> “Therefore let them eat the fruit of their own way, And be filled with their own counsels.

<sup>32</sup> “For the turning away of the simple slays them, And the complacency of fools destroys them.

<sup>33</sup> “But whoever listens to me dwells safely, And is at ease from the dread of evil.”
