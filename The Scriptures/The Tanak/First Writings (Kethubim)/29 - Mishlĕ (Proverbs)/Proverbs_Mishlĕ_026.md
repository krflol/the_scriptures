<sup>1</sup> Like snow in summer, and rain in harvest, So esteem is not fitting for a fool.

<sup>2</sup> As a bird wanders, as a swallow flies about, So a curse without cause does not come.

<sup>3</sup> A whip for a horse, a bridle for a donkey, And a rod for the fool’s back.

<sup>4</sup> Do not answer a fool according to his folly, Lest you also become like him.

<sup>5</sup> Answer a fool according to his folly, Lest he become wise in his own eyes.

<sup>6</sup> He who sends a message by the hand of a fool Cuts off feet, drinks damage.

<sup>7</sup> The legs of the lame hang limp So is a proverb in the mouth of fools.

<sup>8</sup> Like one binding a stone in a sling, So is he who gives esteem to a fool.

<sup>9</sup> A thorn goes into the hand of a drunkard So is a proverb in the mouth of fools.

<sup>10</sup> An archer who wounds anyone, Is he who hires a fool or any passer-by.

<sup>11</sup> As a dog returns to his own vomit, So a fool repeats his folly.

<sup>12</sup> Have you seen a man wise in his own eyes? There is more expectancy for a fool than for him.

<sup>13</sup> The lazy one says, “There is a lion in the way! A fierce lion is in the streets!”

<sup>14</sup> As a door turns on its hinges, So does the lazy one turn on his bed.

<sup>15</sup> The lazy one buries his hand in a dish; It tires him to bring it back to his mouth.

<sup>16</sup> The lazy one is wiser in his own eyes Than seven rendering advice.

<sup>17</sup> A passer-by meddling in a strife not his own Is like one who takes a dog by the ears.

<sup>18</sup> Like a madman who throws sparks, arrows, and death,

<sup>19</sup> So is a man who deceived his neighbour, And says, “I was only joking!”

<sup>20</sup> For lack of wood, the fire goes out. And without a slanderer, strife ceases.

<sup>21</sup> As charcoal is to burning coals, and wood to fire, So is a contentious man to kindle strife.

<sup>23</sup> Burning lips with an evil heart Are like earthenware covered with silver dross.

<sup>24</sup> He who hates, pretends with his lips, And lays up deceit within him;

<sup>25</sup> Though he speaks kindly, do not believe him, For there are seven abominations in his heart.

<sup>26</sup> Hatred is covered by deceit. His evil is disclosed in the assembly.

<sup>27</sup> Whoever digs a pit falls into it, And whoever rolls a stone, it turns back on him.

<sup>28</sup> A lying tongue hates its bruised ones, And a flattering mouth works ruin.
