<sup>1</sup> Do not boast of tomorrow, For you do not know what a day brings forth.

<sup>2</sup> Let another man praise you, And not your own mouth – A stranger, and not your own lips.

<sup>3</sup> A stone is heavy and sand is weighty, But a fool’s wrath is heavier than both.

<sup>4</sup> Wrath is cruel and displeasure overwhelming, But who is able to stand before jealousy?

<sup>5</sup> Open reproof is better than hidden love.

<sup>6</sup> The wounds of a friend are true, But the kisses of an enemy are profuse.

<sup>7</sup> One satisfied loathes the honeycomb, But to a hungry one any bitter food is sweet.

<sup>8</sup> Like a bird that wanders from its nest, So is a man who wanders from his place.

<sup>9</sup> Ointment and perfume gladden the heart, So one’s counsel is sweet to his friend.

<sup>10</sup> Do not forsake your own friend or your father’s friend, And do not go into your brother’s house In the day of your calamity – Better is a neighbour nearby than a brother far away.

<sup>11</sup> My son, be wise, and gladden my heart, That I might have a word for him who reproaches me.

<sup>12</sup> A clever man foresees calamity, hides himself; The simple shall go on, they are punished.

<sup>13</sup> Take the garment of him who is guarantor for a stranger, And for a strange woman pledge it.

<sup>14</sup> He who greets his friend loudly early in the morning, Shall have it reckoned to him as a curse.

<sup>15</sup> Drops that never cease on a very rainy day And a contentious woman are alike;

<sup>16</sup> Whoever represses her represses the wind, And his right hand encounters oil.

<sup>17</sup> Iron is sharpened by iron, And a man sharpens the face of his friend.

<sup>18</sup> He who tends the fig tree eats its fruit; And he who guards his master is esteemed.

<sup>19</sup> As in water face reflects face, So a man’s heart reflects a man.

<sup>20</sup> The grave and destruction are not satisfied; So the eyes of man are not satisfied.

<sup>21</sup> A refining pot is for silver and a furnace for gold, So a man is tried by his praise.

<sup>22</sup> Even if you pound a fool in a mortar with a pestle Along with crushed grain, His folly shall not leave him.

<sup>23</sup> Know well the state of your flocks; Set your heart to your herds;

<sup>24</sup> For riches are not forever, Nor a diadem to all generations.

<sup>25</sup> Grass vanishes, and new grass appears, And the vegetation of the mountains are gathered in.

<sup>26</sup> The lambs are for your garments, And the goats for the price of a field;

<sup>27</sup> And goats’ milk enough for your food, For the food of your household, And sustenance for your girls.
