<sup>1</sup> My son, do not forget my Torah, And let your heart watch over my commands;

<sup>2</sup> For length of days and long life And peace they add to you.

<sup>3</sup> Let not kindness and truth forsake you – Bind them around your neck, Write them on the tablet of your heart,

<sup>4</sup> Thus finding favour and good insight In the eyes of Elohim and man.

<sup>5</sup> Trust in יהוה with all your heart, And lean not on your own understanding;

<sup>6</sup> Know Him in all your ways, And He makes all your paths straight.

<sup>7</sup> Do not be wise in your own eyes; Fear יהוה and turn away from evil.

<sup>8</sup> It is healing to your navel, And moistening to your bones.

<sup>9</sup> Esteem יהוה with your goods, And with the first-fruits of all your increase;

<sup>10</sup> Then your storehouses shall be filled with plenty, And your vats overflow with new wine.

<sup>11</sup> My son, do not despise the discipline of יהוה, And do not loathe His reproof;

<sup>12</sup> For whom יהוה loves He reproves, As a father the son whom he delights in.

<sup>13</sup> Blessed is the man who has found wisdom, And the man who gets understanding;

<sup>14</sup> For the gain from it is better Than gain from silver, And its increase than fine gold.

<sup>15</sup> She is more precious than rubies, And all your delights are not comparable to her.

<sup>16</sup> Length of days is in her right hand, Riches and esteem in her left hand.

<sup>17</sup> Her ways are pleasant ways, And all her paths are peace.

<sup>18</sup> She is a tree of life to those taking hold of her, And blessed are all who retain her.

<sup>19</sup> יהוה founded the earth by wisdom; He established the heavens by understanding;

<sup>20</sup> By His knowledge the depths were broken up, And clouds drop down dew.

<sup>21</sup> My son, let them not depart from your eyes; Watch over sound wisdom and discretion;

<sup>22</sup> Then they become life to your being And an adorning to your neck.

<sup>23</sup> Then you would walk safely in your way, And your foot would not stumble.

<sup>24</sup> When you lie down, you need not be afraid. And you shall lie down and your sleep shall be sweet.

<sup>25</sup> Do not be afraid of sudden dread, Nor of the ruin of the wrong when it comes;

<sup>26</sup> For יהוה is at your side, And He shall guard your foot from being caught.

<sup>27</sup> Do not withhold good from those who deserve it, When it is in the power of your hand to do so.

<sup>28</sup> Do not say to your neighbour, “Go, and come back, and tomorrow I give it,” When you have it with you.

<sup>29</sup> Do not plan evil against your neighbour, Seeing he dwells safely beside you.

<sup>30</sup> Do not strive with a man without cause, If he has done you no evil.

<sup>31</sup> Do not envy a cruel man, And choose none of his ways;

<sup>32</sup> For the perverse one is an abomination to יהוה, And His secret counsel is with the straight.

<sup>33</sup> The curse of יהוה is on the house of the wrong, But He blesses the home of the righteous.

<sup>34</sup> He certainly scoffs the scoffers, But gives favour to the humble.

<sup>35</sup> The wise do inherit esteem, But fools are bearing away shame!
