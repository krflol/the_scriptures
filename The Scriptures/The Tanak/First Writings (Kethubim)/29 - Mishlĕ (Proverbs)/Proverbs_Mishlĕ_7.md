<sup>1</sup> My son, guard my words, And treasure up my commands with you.

<sup>2</sup> Guard my commands and live, And my Torah as the apple of your eye.

<sup>3</sup> Bind them on your fingers; Write them on the tablet of your heart.

<sup>4</sup> Say to wisdom, “You are my sister,” And call understanding a close friend,

<sup>5</sup> To guard you against the strange woman, Against the foreigner who flatters with her words.

<sup>6</sup> For at the window of my house I looked through my lattice,

<sup>7</sup> And I saw among the simple, I perceived among the youths, A young man lacking heart,

<sup>8</sup> Passing through the street near her corner; And he went the way to her house

<sup>9</sup> In the twilight, in the evening, In the black and dark night.

<sup>10</sup> And look, a woman met him, Dressed like a whore, With a hidden heart.

<sup>11</sup> She was boisterous and stubborn, Her feet did not stay at her own house.

<sup>12</sup> Now in the street, Now in the square, And at every corner she lurks.

<sup>13</sup> And she took hold of him and kissed him; She hardened her face and said to him:

<sup>14</sup> “Peace offerings are with me; Today I have paid my vows.

<sup>15</sup> “Therefore I came out to meet you, To earnestly seek your face, and I found you.

<sup>16</sup> “I have spread my bed with coverings, Coloured linens of Mitsrayim.

<sup>17</sup> “I have sprinkled my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.

<sup>18</sup> “Come, let us take our fill of love until morning; Let us delight ourselves with love.

<sup>19</sup> “For my husband is not at home; He has gone on a long journey;

<sup>20</sup> “He took a bag of silver with him; He comes home on the day of the new moon.”

<sup>21</sup> With her many words she leads him astray, With her smooth lips she seduces him.

<sup>22</sup> He goes after her immediately, Like an ox he goes to the slaughter, And as in chains, a fool to the punishment,

<sup>23</sup> Till an arrow strikes through his liver; Like a bird rushing into a snare, And did not know it would take his life.

<sup>24</sup> And now, listen to me, you children; Pay attention to the words of my mouth:

<sup>25</sup> Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways, Do not go astray in her paths.

<sup>26</sup> For many are the wounded she has caused to fall, And numerous all her slain ones.

<sup>27</sup> Her house is the way to the grave, Going down to the rooms of death.

<sup>1</sup> My son, guard my words, And treasure up my commands with you.

<sup>2</sup> Guard my commands and live, And my Torah as the apple of your eye.

<sup>3</sup> Bind them on your fingers; Write them on the tablet of your heart.

<sup>4</sup> Say to wisdom, “You are my sister,” And call understanding a close friend,
