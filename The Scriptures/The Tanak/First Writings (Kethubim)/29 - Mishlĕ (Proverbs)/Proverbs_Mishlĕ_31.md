<sup>1</sup> The words of Sovereign Lemu’ĕl, a message which his mother taught him:

<sup>2</sup> What, my son? And what, son of my womb? And what, son of my vows?

<sup>3</sup> Do not give your strength to women, Nor your ways to wiping away sovereigns.

<sup>4</sup> Not for sovereigns, O Lemu’ĕl, Not for sovereigns to drink wine, Nor for princes to desire strong drink;

<sup>5</sup> Lest they drink and forget the law, And pervert the right of all the afflicted.

<sup>6</sup> Give strong drink to him who is perishing, And wine to those embittered in being.

<sup>7</sup> Let him drink and forget his poverty, And remember his trouble no more.

<sup>8</sup> Open your mouth for the dumb, In the cause of all the sons of the departed.

<sup>9</sup> Open your mouth, judge righteously, And plead the cause of the poor and needy.

<sup>10</sup> Who does find a capable wife? For she is worth far more than rubies.

<sup>11</sup> The heart of her husband shall trust her, And he has no lack of gain.

<sup>12</sup> She shall do him good, and not evil, All the days of her life.

<sup>13</sup> She shall seek wool and flax, And with delight she works with her hands.

<sup>14</sup> She shall be as the ships of Tarshish, She brings in her food from afar.

<sup>15</sup> She also rises while it is still night, And provides food for her household, And a portion for her girls.

<sup>16</sup> She shall consider a field and buy it; From her profits she shall plant a vineyard.

<sup>17</sup> She shall gird herself with strength, And strengthen her arms.

<sup>18</sup> She shall taste when her gain is good; Her lamp does not go out by night.

<sup>19</sup> She shall stretch out her hands to the distaff, And her hand shall hold the spindle.

<sup>20</sup> She shall extend her hand to the poor, And she shall reach out her hands to the needy.

<sup>21</sup> She is not afraid of snow for her household, For all her household is dressed in scarlet.

<sup>22</sup> She shall make tapestry for herself; She is dressed in fine linen and purple.

<sup>23</sup> Her husband is known in the gates, When he sits among the elders of the land.

<sup>24</sup> She shall make fine linen and sell them, And shall give girdles for the merchants.

<sup>25</sup> Strength and splendour are her garments, And she rejoices in time to come.

<sup>26</sup> She shall open her mouth with wisdom, And on her tongue is the Torah of kindness.

<sup>27</sup> She watches over the ways of her household, And does not eat the bread of idleness.

<sup>28</sup> Her children shall rise up and call her blessed; Her husband too, and he praises her:

<sup>29</sup> “Many daughters have done nobly, But you have risen over them all.”

<sup>30</sup> Loveliness is deceptive And prettiness is vain, A woman who fears יהוה is to be praised.

<sup>31</sup> Give her of the fruit of her hands, And let her works praise her in the gates.
