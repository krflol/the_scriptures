<sup>1</sup> The separatist seeks his own desire; He breaks out against all sound wisdom.

<sup>2</sup> A fool does not delight in understanding, But in uncovering his own heart.

<sup>3</sup> When a wrong one comes, scorn comes too. And with shame comes reproach.

<sup>4</sup> The words of a man’s mouth are deep waters; The fountain of wisdom is a flowing stream.

<sup>5</sup> It is not good to show partiality to the wrong, Or to turn aside the righteous in right-ruling.

<sup>6</sup> A fool’s lips enter into strife, And his mouth calls for blows.

<sup>7</sup> A fool’s mouth is his ruin, And his lips are the snare of his life.

<sup>8</sup> The words of a slanderer are like delicacies, And they go down into the inner parts of the heart.

<sup>9</sup> Also, he who is slack in his work Is a brother of a master destroyer.

<sup>10</sup> The Name of יהוה is a strong tower; The righteous run into it and are safe.

<sup>11</sup> The rich man’s wealth is his strong city, And like a high wall in his own imagination.

<sup>12</sup> Before destruction the heart of a man is haughty, And before esteem is humility.

<sup>13</sup> He who answers a matter before he hears it, It is folly and shame to him.

<sup>14</sup> The spirit of a man sustains him in sickness, But who does bear a broken spirit?

<sup>15</sup> The heart of the understanding one gets knowledge, And the ear of the wise seeks knowledge.

<sup>16</sup> A man’s gift makes room for him, And brings him before great men.

<sup>17</sup> The first to state his own case, seems right, Until another comes and examines him.

<sup>18</sup> The lot settles disputes, And separates between the mighty.

<sup>19</sup> A brother transgressed against is a strong city, And contentions are like the bars of a citadel.

<sup>20</sup> A man’s stomach is satisfied From the fruit of his mouth; He is satisfied with the increase of his lips.

<sup>21</sup> Death and life are in the power of the tongue, And those loving it eat its fruit.

<sup>22</sup> He who has found a wife has found good, And receives favour from יהוה.

<sup>23</sup> The poor speaks beseechingly, But the rich answers fiercely.

<sup>24</sup> A man of many friends might come to ruin, But there is a Loving One Who sticks closer than a brother!
