<sup>1</sup> To man belongs the preparations of the heart, But from יהוה is the answer of the tongue.

<sup>2</sup> All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes, But יהוה weighs the spirits.

<sup>3</sup> Commit your works to יהוה, And your plans shall be established.

<sup>4</sup> יהוה has made all for His purpose, And also the wrong for the day of evil.

<sup>5</sup> Everyone proud in heart is an abomination to יהוה ; Hand to hand: he goes not unpunished.

<sup>6</sup> By kindness and truth crookedness is pardoned. And in the fear of יהוה one turns away from evil.

<sup>7</sup> When a man’s ways please יהוה, He makes even his enemies to be at peace with him.

<sup>8</sup> Better is a little with righteousness, Than a large income without right-ruling.

<sup>9</sup> A man’s heart plans his way, But יהוה establishes his steps.

<sup>10</sup> An oath is on the lips of the sovereign, In right-ruling his mouth trespasses not.

<sup>11</sup> A right scale and balances are of יהוה ; All the weights in the bag are His work.

<sup>12</sup> It is an abomination for sovereigns To commit wrongness, For a throne is established by righteousness.

<sup>13</sup> Righteous lips are the delight of sovereigns, And they love him who speaks what is straight.

<sup>14</sup> The sovereign’s wrath is a messenger of death, But a wise man appeases it.

<sup>15</sup> In the light of a sovereign’s face is life, And his delight is like a cloud of the latter rain.

<sup>16</sup> How much better it is to get wisdom than gold! And to get understanding is preferable to silver.

<sup>17</sup> The highway of the straight Is to turn away from evil; He who guards his life watches over His way.

<sup>18</sup> Before destruction comes pride, And before a fall a haughty spirit!

<sup>19</sup> Better to be lowly in spirit with the poor, Than to divide the spoil with the proud.

<sup>20</sup> He who acts wisely concerning the Word finds good, And blessed is he who trusts in יהוה.

<sup>21</sup> The wise-hearted is called discerning, And sweetness of lips increases learning.

<sup>22</sup> Understanding is a fountain of life to him who has it, But the disciplining of fools is folly.

<sup>23</sup> The heart of the wise gives discretion to his mouth, And he increases learning to his lips.

<sup>24</sup> Pleasant words are like a honeycomb, Sweet to the being, and healing to the bones.

<sup>25</sup> There is a way that seems right to a man, But its end is the way of death.

<sup>26</sup> He who labours, labours for himself, For his mouth drives him on.

<sup>27</sup> A man of Beliya‛al plots evil, And on his lips it is like a burning fire.

<sup>28</sup> A perverse man sends forth strife, And a whisperer separates intimate friends.

<sup>29</sup> A ruthless man entices his neighbour, And leads him in a way that is not good,

<sup>30</sup> Winking with his eye to plot perversity, Moving his lips he shall bring about evil.

<sup>31</sup> Grey hair is a crown of adorning, It is found in the way of righteousness.

<sup>32</sup> He who is patient is better than the mighty, And he who rules over his spirit than he who takes a city.

<sup>33</sup> The lot is cast into the lap, But every decision by it is from יהוה.

<sup>1</sup> To man belongs the preparations of the heart, But from יהוה is the answer of the tongue.
