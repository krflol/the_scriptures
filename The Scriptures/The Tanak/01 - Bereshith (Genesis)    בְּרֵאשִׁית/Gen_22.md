<sup>1</sup> And it came to be after these events that Elohim tried Aḇraham, and said to him, “Aḇraham!” And he said, “Here I am.”
<sup>2</sup> And He said, “Take your son, now, your only son Yitsḥaq, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriyah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains which I command you.”
<sup>3</sup> And Aḇraham rose early in the morning and saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and Yitsḥaq his son. And he split the wood for the burnt offering, and arose and went to the place which Elohim had commanded him.
<sup>4</sup> And on the third day Aḇraham lifted his eyes and saw the place from a distance.
<sup>5</sup> So Aḇraham said to his young men, “Stay here with the donkey while the boy and I go over there and worship, and come back to you.”
<sup>6</sup> And Aḇraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Yitsḥaq his son. And he took the fire in his hand, and a knife, and the two of them went together.
<sup>7</sup> And Yitsḥaq spoke to Aḇraham his father and said, “My father!” And he said, “Here I am, my son.” And he said, “See, the fire and the wood! But where is the lamb for a burnt offering?”
<sup>8</sup> And Aḇraham said, “My son, Elohim does provide for Himself the lamb for a burnt offering.” And the two of them went together.
<sup>9</sup> And they came to the place which Elohim had commanded him, and Aḇraham built an altar there and placed the wood in order. And he bound Yitsḥaq his son and laid him on the altar, upon the wood.
<sup>10</sup> And Aḇraham stretched out his hand and took the knife to slay his son,
<sup>11</sup> but the Messenger of יהוה called to him from the heavens and said, “Aḇraham, Aḇraham!” And he said, “Here I am.”
<sup>12</sup> And He said, “Do not lay your hand on the boy, nor touch him. For now I know that you fear Elohim, seeing you have not withheld your son, your only son, from Me.”
<sup>13</sup> And Aḇraham lifted his eyes and looked and saw behind him a ram caught in a bush by its horns, and Aḇraham went and took the ram and offered it up for a burnt offering instead of his son.
<sup>14</sup> And Aḇraham called the name of the place, ‘ יהוה Yireh,’ as it is said to this day, “On the mountain יהוה provides.”
<sup>15</sup> And the Messenger of יהוה called to Aḇraham a second time from the heavens,
<sup>16</sup> and said, “By Myself I have sworn, declares יהוה, because you have done this, and have not withheld your son, your only son,
<sup>17</sup> that I shall certainly bless you, and I shall certainly increase your seed as the stars of the heavens and as the sand which is on the seashore, and let your seed possess the gate of their enemies.
<sup>18</sup> “And in your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed, because you have obeyed My voice.”
<sup>19</sup> Then Aḇraham returned to his young men, and they rose up and went together to Be’ĕrsheḇa. And Aḇraham dwelt at Be’ĕrsheḇa.
<sup>20</sup> And it came to be after these events that it was reported to Aḇraham, saying, “See, Milkah too has borne children to your brother Naḥor:
<sup>21</sup> “Uts his first-born, and Buz his brother, and Qemu’ĕl the father of Aram,
<sup>22</sup> and Keseḏ, and Ḥazo, and Pildash, and Yiḏlaph, and Bethu’ĕl.”
<sup>23</sup> And Bethu’ĕl brought forth Riḇqah. These eight Milkah bore to Naḥor, Aḇraham’s brother.
<sup>24</sup> And his concubine, whose name was Re’uwmah, also bore Teḇaḥ, and Gaḥam, and Taḥash, and Ma‛aḵah.
