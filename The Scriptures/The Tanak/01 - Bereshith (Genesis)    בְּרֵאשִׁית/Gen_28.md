<sup>1</sup> And Yitsḥaq called Ya‛aqoḇ and blessed him, and commanded him, and said to him, “Do not take a wife from the daughters of Kena‛an.
<sup>2</sup> “Arise, go to Paddan Aram, to the house of Bethu’ĕl your mother’s father. And take a wife for yourself from there, from the daughters of Laḇan your mother’s brother.
<sup>3</sup> “And Ĕl Shaddai bless you, and make you bear fruit and increase you, and you shall become an assembly of peoples,
<sup>4</sup> and give you the blessing of Aḇraham, to you and your seed with you, so that you inherit the land of your sojournings, which Elohim gave to Aḇraham.”
<sup>5</sup> So Yitsḥaq sent Ya‛aqoḇ away, and he went to Paddan Aram, to Laḇan son of Bethu’ĕl the Aramean, the brother of Riḇqah, the mother of Ya‛aqoḇ and Ĕsaw.
<sup>6</sup> And Ĕsaw saw that Yitsḥaq had blessed Ya‛aqoḇ and sent him away to Paddan Aram to take himself a wife from there, and that as he blessed him he gave him a command, saying, “Do not take a wife from the daughters of Kena‛an,”
<sup>7</sup> and that Ya‛aqoḇ had obeyed his father and his mother and had gone to Paddan Aram.
<sup>8</sup> So Ĕsaw saw that the daughters of Kena‛an did not please his father Yitsḥaq,
<sup>9</sup> and Ĕsaw went to Yishma‛ĕl and took Maḥalath the daughter of Yishma‛ĕl, Aḇraham’s son, the sister of Neḇayoth, to be his wife, besides the wives he had.
<sup>10</sup> And Ya‛aqoḇ went out from Be’ĕrsheḇa and went toward Ḥaran.
<sup>11</sup> And he came upon a place and stopped over for the night, for the sun had set. And he took one of the stones of that place and put it at his head, and he lay down in that place to sleep.
<sup>12</sup> And he dreamed and saw a ladder set up on the earth, and its top reached to the heavens, and saw messengers of Elohim going up and coming down on it.
<sup>13</sup> And see, יהוה stood above it and said, “I am יהוה Elohim of Aḇraham your father and the Elohim of Yitsḥaq. The land on which you are lying, I give it to you and your seed.
<sup>14</sup> “And your seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and you shall break forth to the west and to the east, to the north and the south. And all the clans of the earth shall be blessed in you and in your seed.
<sup>15</sup> “And see, I am with you and shall guard you wherever you go, and shall bring you back to this land. For I am not going to leave you until I have done what I have spoken to you.”
<sup>16</sup> And Ya‛aqoḇ awoke from his sleep and said, “Truly, יהוה is in this place, and I did not know it.”
<sup>17</sup> And he was afraid and said, “How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of Elohim, and this is the gate of the heavens!”
<sup>18</sup> And Ya‛aqoḇ rose early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put at his head, set it up as a standing column, and poured oil on top of it.
<sup>19</sup> And he called the name of that place Bĕyth Ĕl, however, the name of that city had been Luz previously.
<sup>20</sup> And Ya‛aqoḇ made a vow, saying, “Seeing Elohim is with me, and has kept me in this way that I am going, and has given me bread to eat and a garment to put on –
<sup>21</sup> when I have returned to my father’s house in peace, and יהוה has been my Elohim,
<sup>22</sup> then this stone which I have set as a standing column shall be Elohim’s house, and of all that You give me, I shall certainly give a tenth to You.”
