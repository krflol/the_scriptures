<sup>1</sup> And Aḇraham took another wife, whose name was Qeturah.
<sup>2</sup> And she bore him Zimran, and Yoqshan, and Meḏan, and Miḏyan, and Yishbaq, and Shuwaḥ.
<sup>3</sup> And Yoqshan brought forth Sheḇa and Deḏan. And the sons of Deḏan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Le’ummim.
<sup>4</sup> And the sons of Miḏyan were Ĕphah, and Ĕpher, and Ḥanoḵ, and Aḇiḏa, and Elda‛ah. All these were the children of Qeturah.
<sup>5</sup> Now Aḇraham gave all that he had to Yitsḥaq,
<sup>6</sup> but to the sons of the concubines whom Aḇraham had, Aḇraham gave gifts while he was still living, and sent them away from his son Yitsḥaq, eastward, to the land of the east.
<sup>7</sup> And these are all the years of Aḇraham’s life which he lived: one hundred and seventy-five years.
<sup>8</sup> And Aḇraham breathed his last and died in a good old age, aged and satisfied, and was gathered to his people.
<sup>9</sup> And his sons Yitsḥaq and Yishma‛ĕl buried him in the cave of Maḵpĕlah, which is before Mamrĕ, in the field of Ephron son of Tsoḥar the Ḥittite,
<sup>10</sup> the field which Aḇraham purchased from the sons of Ḥĕth. There Aḇraham was buried with Sarah his wife.
<sup>11</sup> And it came to be, after the death of Aḇraham, that Elohim blessed his son Yitsḥaq. And Yitsḥaq dwelt at Be’ĕr Laḥai Ro’i.
<sup>12</sup> And this is the genealogy of Yishma‛ĕl, Aḇraham’s son, whom Haḡar the Mitsrite, Sarah’s female servant, bore to Aḇraham.
<sup>13</sup> And these were the names of the sons of Yishma‛ĕl, by their names, according to their generations: The first-born of Yishma‛ĕl, Neḇayoth; then Qĕḏar, and Aḏbe’ĕl, and Miḇsam,
<sup>14</sup> and Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,
<sup>15</sup> Haḏar, and Tĕma, Yetur, Naphish, and Qĕḏemah.
<sup>16</sup> These were the sons of Yishma‛ĕl and these were their names, by their towns and their settlements, twelve chiefs according to their tribes.
<sup>17</sup> And these were the years of the life of Yishma‛ĕl: one hundred and thirty-seven years. And he breathed his last and died, and was gathered to his people.
<sup>18</sup> And they dwelt from Ḥawilah as far as Shur, which is east of Mitsrayim as you go toward Ashshur. He settled before all his brothers.
<sup>19</sup> And this is the genealogy of Yitsḥaq, Aḇraham’s son. Aḇraham brought forth Yitsḥaq.
<sup>20</sup> And Yitsḥaq was forty years old when he took Riḇqah as wife, the daughter of Bethu’ĕl the Aramean of Paddan Aram, the sister of Laḇan the Aramean.
<sup>21</sup> And Yitsḥaq prayed to יהוה for his wife, because she was barren. And יהוה answered his prayer, and Riḇqah his wife conceived.
<sup>22</sup> And within her the children struggled together, and she said, “If all is right, why am I this way?” So she went to ask יהוה.
<sup>23</sup> And יהוה said to her, “Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples shall be separated from your body. And one people shall be stronger than the other, and the older serve the younger.”
<sup>24</sup> And when the days were filled for her to give birth, and see, twins were in her womb!
<sup>25</sup> And the first came out red all over, like a hairy garment, so they called his name Ĕsaw.
<sup>26</sup> And afterward his brother came out, with his hand holding on to Ĕsaw’s heel, so his name was called Ya‛aqoḇ. And Yitsḥaq was sixty years old when she bore them.
<sup>27</sup> And the boys grew up. And Ĕsaw became a man knowing how to hunt, a man of the field, while Ya‛aqoḇ was a complete man, dwelling in tents.
<sup>28</sup> And Yitsḥaq loved Ĕsaw because he ate of his wild game, but Riḇqah loved Ya‛aqoḇ.
<sup>29</sup> And Ya‛aqoḇ cooked a stew, and Ĕsaw came in from the field, and he was weary.
<sup>30</sup> And Ĕsaw said to Ya‛aqoḇ, “Please feed me with that same red stew, for I am weary.” That is why his name was called Eḏom.
<sup>31</sup> But Ya‛aqoḇ said, “Sell me your birthright today.”
<sup>32</sup> And Ĕsaw said, “Look, I am going to die, so why should I have birthright?”
<sup>33</sup> Then Ya‛aqoḇ said, “Swear to me today.” And he swore to him, and sold his birthright to Ya‛aqoḇ.
<sup>34</sup> Ya‛aqoḇ then gave Ĕsaw bread and stew of lentils. And he ate and drank, and rose up and left. Thus Ĕsaw despised his birthright.
