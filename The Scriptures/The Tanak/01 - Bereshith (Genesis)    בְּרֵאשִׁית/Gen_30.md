<sup>1</sup> And when Raḥĕl saw that she bore Ya‛aqoḇ no children, Raḥĕl envied her sister, and said to Ya‛aqoḇ, “Give me children, or else I am going to die!”
<sup>2</sup> And Ya‛aqoḇ’s displeasure burned against Raḥĕl, and he said, “Am I in the place of Elohim, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?”
<sup>3</sup> And she said, “See, my female servant Bilhah; go in to her, and let her bear for me, and let me be built up from her as well.”
<sup>4</sup> So she gave him Bilhah her female servant as wife, and Ya‛aqoḇ went in to her.
<sup>5</sup> And Bilhah conceived and bore Ya‛aqoḇ a son.
<sup>6</sup> And Raḥĕl said, “Elohim has rightly ruled my case, and has also heard my voice and given me a son.” So she called his name Dan.
<sup>7</sup> And Raḥĕl’s female servant Bilhah conceived again and bore Ya‛aqoḇ a second son.
<sup>8</sup> And Raḥĕl said, “With great wrestlings I have wrestled with my sister, and I have overcome.” So she called his name Naphtali.
<sup>9</sup> And Lĕ’ah saw that she had ceased bearing, and she took Zilpah her female servant and gave her to Ya‛aqoḇ as wife.
<sup>10</sup> And Lĕ’ah’s female servant Zilpah bore Ya‛aqoḇ a son.
<sup>11</sup> And Lĕ’ah said, “With Gaḏ!” So she called his name Gaḏ.
<sup>12</sup> And Lĕ’ah’s female servant Zilpah bore Ya‛aqoḇ a second son.
<sup>13</sup> And Lĕ’ah said, “I am blessed, for the daughters shall call me blessed.” So she called his name Ashĕr.
<sup>14</sup> And Re’uḇĕn went in the days of wheat harvest and found love-apples in the field, and brought them to his mother Lĕ’ah. And Raḥĕl said to Lĕ’ah, “Please give me some of your son’s love-apples.”
<sup>15</sup> But she said to her, “Is it a small matter that you have taken away my husband? Would you take away my son’s love-apples too?” And Raḥĕl said, “Therefore let him lie with you tonight for your son’s love-apples.”
<sup>16</sup> And when Ya‛aqoḇ came out of the field in the evening, Lĕ’ah went out to meet him and said, “Do come in to me, for indeed, I have hired you with my son’s love-apples.” And he lay with her that night.
<sup>17</sup> And Elohim listened to Lĕ’ah, and she conceived and bore Ya‛aqoḇ a fifth son.
<sup>18</sup> And Lĕ’ah said, “Elohim has given me my hire, because I have given my female servant to my husband.” So she called his name Yissasḵar.
<sup>19</sup> And Lĕ’ah conceived again and bore Ya‛aqoḇ a sixth son.
<sup>20</sup> And Lĕ’ah said, “Elohim has presented me with a good present. Now my husband is going to dwell with me, because I have borne him six sons.” So she called his name Zeḇulun.
<sup>21</sup> And afterward she bore a daughter, and called her name Dinah.
<sup>22</sup> And Elohim remembered Raḥĕl, and Elohim listened to her and opened her womb.
<sup>23</sup> And she conceived, and bore a son, and said, “Elohim has taken away my reproach.”
<sup>24</sup> So she called his name Yosĕph, and said, “ יהוה has added to me another son.”
<sup>25</sup> And it came to be, when Raḥĕl had borne Yosĕph, that Ya‛aqoḇ said to Laḇan, “Send me on my way, to go to my own place and to my land.
<sup>26</sup> “Give my wives and my children for whom I have served you, and let me go, for you yourself know my service which I have done for you.”
<sup>27</sup> And Laḇan said to him, “If I have found favour in your eyes, please stay, for I have diligently watched that יהוה has blessed me for your sake.”
<sup>28</sup> And he said, “Name me your wages, and I give it.”
<sup>29</sup> So he said to him, “You know how I have served you and how your livestock has been with me.
<sup>30</sup> “For the little you had before I came has increased greatly, and יהוה has blessed you since my coming. But now, when am I to provide for my own house too?”
<sup>31</sup> And he said, “What do I give you?” And Ya‛aqoḇ said, “Give me naught! If you do this for me, I shall again feed and guard your flocks:
<sup>32</sup> “Let me pass through all your flock today, removing from there all the speckled and spotted sheep, and all the black ones among the lambs, and the spotted and speckled among the goats. And these shall be my wages.
<sup>33</sup> “And my righteousness shall answer for me in time to come, when you come concerning my wages: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and black among the lambs, it is stolen if it is with me.”
<sup>34</sup> And Laḇan said, “See, let it be according to your word!”
<sup>35</sup> And on that day he set aside the male goats that were speckled and spotted, and all the female goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had some white in it, and all the black ones among the lambs, and gave them into the hand of his sons.
<sup>36</sup> And he put three days’ journey between himself and Ya‛aqoḇ, and Ya‛aqoḇ fed the rest of Laḇan’s flocks.
<sup>37</sup> And Ya‛aqoḇ took for himself rods of green poplar and of the almond and chestnut trees, peeled white strips in them, and exposed the white which was in the rods.
<sup>38</sup> And he set the rods which he had peeled before the flocks in the gutters, in the watering troughs where the flocks came to drink, and they conceived when they came to drink.
<sup>39</sup> So the flocks conceived before the rods, and the flocks brought forth streaked, speckled, and spotted.
<sup>40</sup> And Ya‛aqoḇ separated the lambs, and made the flocks face toward the streaked and all the black in the flock of Laḇan, but he put his own flocks by themselves and did not put them with Laḇan’s flock.
<sup>41</sup> And it came to be, whenever the strong ones of the flock conceived, that Ya‛aqoḇ placed the rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters, so they would conceive among the rods.
<sup>42</sup> But when the flocks were weak, he did not put them in, so the weak ones were Laḇan’s and the strong ones Ya‛aqoḇ’s.
<sup>43</sup> Thus the man increased very much, and had many flocks, and female and male servants, and camels and donkeys.
