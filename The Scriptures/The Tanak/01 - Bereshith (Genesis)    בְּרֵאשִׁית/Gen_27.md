<sup>1</sup> And it came to be, when Yitsḥaq was old and his eyes were too dim to see, that he called Ĕsaw his elder son and said to him, “My son.” And he answered him, “Here I am.”
<sup>2</sup> And he said, “See now, I am old, I do not know the day of my death.
<sup>3</sup> “Now then, please take your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field and hunt wild game for me.
<sup>4</sup> “And make me a tasty dish, such as I love, and bring it to me to eat, in order that my being does bless you before I die.”
<sup>5</sup> And Riḇqah heard when Yitsḥaq spoke to Ĕsaw his son. And Ĕsaw went to the field to hunt wild game and to bring it.
<sup>6</sup> And Riḇqah spoke to Ya‛aqoḇ her son, saying, “See, I heard your father speak to Ĕsaw your brother, saying,
<sup>7</sup> ‘Bring me wild game and make me a tasty dish to eat, and bless you in the presence of יהוה before my death.’
<sup>8</sup> “And now my son, listen to my voice according to what I command you.
<sup>9</sup> “Please go to the flock and bring me two choice young goats, and I make a tasty dish from them for your father, such as he loves.
<sup>10</sup> “And you shall take it to your father, and he shall eat it, so that he might bless you before his death.”
<sup>11</sup> And Ya‛aqoḇ said to Riḇqah his mother, “See, Ĕsaw my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth-skinned man.
<sup>12</sup> “What if my father touches me? Then I shall be like a deceiver in his eyes, and shall bring a curse on myself and not a blessing.”
<sup>13</sup> But his mother said to him, “Let your curse be on me, my son. Only obey my voice, and go, get them for me.”
<sup>14</sup> And he went and fetched them and brought them to his mother, and his mother made a tasty dish, such as his father loved.
<sup>15</sup> And Riḇqah took the best garments of her elder son Ĕsaw, which were with her in the house, and put them on Ya‛aqoḇ her younger son.
<sup>16</sup> And she put the skins of the young goats on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck.
<sup>17</sup> Then she gave the tasty dish and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Ya‛aqoḇ.
<sup>18</sup> And he went to his father and said, “My father.” And he said, “Here I am. Who are you, my son?”
<sup>19</sup> And Ya‛aqoḇ said to his father, “I am Ĕsaw your first-born, I have done as you said to me. Please rise, sit and eat of my wild game, so that your being might bless me.”
<sup>20</sup> But Yitsḥaq said to his son, “How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son?” And he said, “Because יהוה your Elohim brought it to me.”
<sup>21</sup> Then Yitsḥaq said to Ya‛aqoḇ, “Please come near, so that I feel you, my son, whether you truly are my son Ĕsaw or not.”
<sup>22</sup> And Ya‛aqoḇ went near to Yitsḥaq his father, and he felt him and said, “The voice is the voice of Ya‛aqoḇ, but the hands are the hands of Ĕsaw.”
<sup>23</sup> And he did not recognise him, for his hands were hairy like his brother Ĕsaw’s hands, and he blessed him.
<sup>24</sup> And he said, “Are you truly my son Ĕsaw?” And he said, “I am.”
<sup>25</sup> And he said, “Bring it near to me, and let me eat of my son’s wild game, so that my being might bless you.” So he brought it near to him, and he ate. And he brought him wine, and he drank.
<sup>26</sup> And his father Yitsḥaq said to him, “Please come near and kiss me, my son.”
<sup>27</sup> And he came near and kissed him. And he smelled the smell of his garments, and blessed him and said, “See, the smell of my son is like the smell of a field which יהוה has blessed.
<sup>28</sup> And Elohim give you of the dew of the heavens, of the fatness of the earth, and plenty of grain and wine.
<sup>29</sup> Let peoples serve you, and nations bow down to you. Be master over your brothers, and let your mother’s sons bow down to you. Cursed be those cursing you, and blessed be those blessing you!”
<sup>30</sup> And it came to be, as soon as Yitsḥaq had finished blessing Ya‛aqoḇ, and Ya‛aqoḇ had hardly left the presence of Yitsḥaq his father, that Ĕsaw his brother came in from his hunting.
<sup>31</sup> And he too had made a tasty dish and brought it to his father, and said to his father, “Let my father rise and eat of his son’s wild game, so that your being might bless me.”
<sup>32</sup> And his father Yitsḥaq said to him, “Who are you?” And he said, “I am your son, your first-born, Ĕsaw.”
<sup>33</sup> Then Yitsḥaq trembled exceedingly, and said, “Who was it then who hunted wild game and brought it to me? And I ate all of it before you came, and I have blessed him. Yea, he is blessed.”
<sup>34</sup> When Ĕsaw heard the words of his father, he cried with an exceedingly great and bitter cry, and said to his father, “Bless me, me too, O my father!”
<sup>35</sup> And he said, “Your brother came with deceit and took your blessing.”
<sup>36</sup> And Ĕsaw said, “Was his name, then, called Ya‛aqoḇ? For he has caught me by the heel these two times. He took my birthright, and see, now he has taken my blessing!” And he said, “Have you not reserved a blessing for me?”
<sup>37</sup> Then Yitsḥaq answered and said to Ĕsaw, “See, I have made him your master, and all his brothers I have given to him as servants. And I have sustained him with grain and wine. And what, then, shall I do for you, my son?”
<sup>38</sup> And Ĕsaw said to his father, “Have you only one blessing, my father? Bless me, me too, O my father!” And Ĕsaw lifted up his voice and wept.
<sup>39</sup> And Yitsḥaq his father answered and said to him, “See, your dwelling is of the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of the heavens from above.
<sup>40</sup> And by your sword you are to live, and serve your brother. And it shall be, when you grow restless, that you shall break his yoke from your neck.”
<sup>41</sup> And Ĕsaw hated Ya‛aqoḇ because of the blessing with which his father blessed him, and Ĕsaw said in his heart, “The days of mourning for my father draw near, then I am going to kill my brother Ya‛aqoḇ.”
<sup>42</sup> And the words of Ĕsaw her older son were reported to Riḇqah, and she sent and called Ya‛aqoḇ her younger son, and said to him, “See, your brother Ĕsaw comforts himself concerning you, to kill you.
<sup>43</sup> “And now, my son, listen to my voice, and rise, flee to my brother Laḇan in Ḥaran.
<sup>44</sup> “And stay with him a few days, until your brother’s wrath turns away,
<sup>45</sup> until your brother’s displeasure turns away from you, and he forgets what you have done to him. And I shall send and bring you from there. Why should I be bereaved of you both in one day?”
<sup>46</sup> And Riḇqah said to Yitsḥaq, “I am disgusted with my life because of the daughters of Ḥĕth. If Ya‛aqoḇ takes a wife from the daughters of Ḥĕth, like these who are the daughters of the land, what is my life to me?”
