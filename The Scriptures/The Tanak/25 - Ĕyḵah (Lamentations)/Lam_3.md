<sup>1</sup> I am the man who has seen affliction By the rod of His wrath.
<sup>2</sup> He has led me and made me walk In darkness and not light.
<sup>3</sup> Indeed, He has turned back, He has turned His hand against me all the day.
<sup>4</sup> He has worn out my flesh and my skin, He has broken my bones.
<sup>5</sup> He has piled up against me, And surrounded me with bitterness and hardship.
<sup>6</sup> He has made me dwell in dark places Like the dead of old.
<sup>7</sup> He has hedged me in and I do not go out, He has made my chain heavy.
<sup>8</sup> Also, when I cry and shout, He shuts out my prayer.
<sup>9</sup> He has blocked my ways with hewn stone, He has made my paths crooked.
<sup>10</sup> He is to me like a bear lying in wait, A lion in hiding.
<sup>11</sup> He has turned aside my ways And torn me in pieces, He has laid me waste.
<sup>12</sup> He has bent His bow And set me up as a target for the arrow.
<sup>13</sup> He made the arrows of His quiver pierce my kidneys.
<sup>14</sup> I have been a mockery to all my people, Their mocking song all the day.
<sup>15</sup> He has filled me with bitterness, He drenched me with wormwood.
<sup>16</sup> And He has broken my teeth with gravel, He has covered me with ashes.
<sup>17</sup> And You have removed my being far from peace, I have forgotten goodness.
<sup>18</sup> And I said, “My strength and my expectancy Have perished from יהוה.”
<sup>19</sup> Remember my affliction and my anguish, The wormwood and the gall.
<sup>20</sup> Your being indeed remembers And bows down upon me.
<sup>21</sup> This I recall to my mind, therefore I wait:
<sup>22</sup> The kindnesses of יהוה ! For we have not been consumed, For His compassions have not ended.
<sup>23</sup> They are new every morning, Great is Your trustworthiness.
<sup>24</sup> “ יהוה is my Portion,” says my being, “Therefore I wait for Him!”
<sup>25</sup> יהוה is good to those waiting for Him, To the being who seeks Him.
<sup>26</sup> It is good – both to wait and to be silent, For the deliverance of יהוה.
<sup>27</sup> It is good for a man to bear a yoke in his youth.
<sup>28</sup> Let him sit alone and be silent, Because He has laid it on him.
<sup>29</sup> Let him put his mouth in the dust, There might yet be expectancy.
<sup>30</sup> Let him give his cheek To the one who smites him – He is filled with reproach.
<sup>31</sup> For יהוה does not cast off forever.
<sup>32</sup> For though He afflicted, Yet He shall show compassion According to the greatness of His kindnesses.
<sup>33</sup> For He has not afflicted from His heart, Nor does He grieve the children of men.
<sup>34</sup> To crush under His feet All the prisoners of the earth,
<sup>35</sup> To turn aside the right-ruling of man Before the face of the Most High,
<sup>36</sup> Or wrong a man in his cause – This יהוה does not approve.
<sup>37</sup> Who was it that spoke, And it came to be! Has יהוה not commanded it?
<sup>38</sup> Do not the evils and the good Come out of the mouth of the Most High?
<sup>39</sup> What? Should mankind complain, A living man, because of his sins?
<sup>40</sup> Let us search and examine our ways, And turn back to יהוה.
<sup>41</sup> Let us lift our hearts and hands To Ĕl in the heavens and say:
<sup>42</sup> We, we have transgressed and rebelled. You, You have not forgiven.
<sup>43</sup> You have wrapped Yourself With displeasure and pursued us. You have slain, You have not shown compassion.
<sup>44</sup> You have wrapped Yourself With a cloud, so that prayer does not pass through.
<sup>45</sup> You make us as scum and refuse In the midst of the peoples.
<sup>46</sup> All our enemies have opened their mouth against us.
<sup>47</sup> Fear and a snare have come upon us, Shame and ruin.
<sup>48</sup> Streams of water run down my eye For the ruin of the daughter of my people.
<sup>49</sup> My eye flows out and does not cease, Without stopping,
<sup>50</sup> Until יהוה looks down and sees from the heavens.
<sup>51</sup> My eye pains my being Because of all the daughters of my city.
<sup>52</sup> My enemies hunted me down Like a bird, without cause.
<sup>53</sup> They have cut off my life in the pit, And they threw stones at me.
<sup>54</sup> Waters flowed over my head; I said, “I am cut off!”
<sup>55</sup> I called on Your Name, O יהוה, from the lowest pit.
<sup>56</sup> You have heard my voice, Do not hide Your ear from my groaning, From my outcry!
<sup>57</sup> You drew near on the day I called on You; You said, “Do not fear!”
<sup>58</sup> O יהוה, You did plead the case for my being; You have redeemed my life.
<sup>59</sup> O יהוה, You have seen my oppression; Judge my case.
<sup>60</sup> You have seen all their vengeance, All their plans against me.
<sup>61</sup> You have heard their reproach, O יהוה, all their plans against me,
<sup>62</sup> The lips of those rising against me, And their scheming against me all the day.
<sup>63</sup> Look at their sitting down and their rising up; I am their song.
<sup>64</sup> Repay them, O יהוה, According to the work of their hands.
<sup>65</sup> Give them a veiled heart, Your curse upon them!
<sup>66</sup> Pursue and destroy them in displeasure, From under the heavens of יהוה.
