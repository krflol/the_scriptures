<sup>1</sup> Remember, O יהוה, what has come upon us. Look, and see our reproach!
<sup>2</sup> Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers, And our houses to foreigners.
<sup>3</sup> We have become orphans, fatherless, Our mothers are like widows.
<sup>4</sup> We had to pay for our drinking water, And our wood comes at a price.
<sup>5</sup> We have been pursued close onto our neck, We have laboured and had no rest.
<sup>6</sup> To Mitsrayim we have given a hand; To Ashshur, to be satisfied with bread.
<sup>7</sup> Our fathers sinned, they are no more. We have borne their crookednesses.
<sup>8</sup> Servants have ruled over us; There is no one to deliver from their hand.
<sup>9</sup> With our lives we bring in our bread, Because of the sword of the wilderness.
<sup>10</sup> Our skin has become as hot as an oven, Because of the burning heat of scarcity of food.
<sup>11</sup> They have humbled the women in Tsiyon, The maidens in the cities of Yehuḏah.
<sup>12</sup> Rulers were hung up by their hands, And elders were not respected.
<sup>13</sup> They have taken young men to grind, And youths stumbled under loads of wood.
<sup>14</sup> Elders have ceased from the gate, Young men from their song.
<sup>15</sup> The joy of our heart has ceased, Our dancing has turned into mourning.
<sup>16</sup> The crown has fallen from our head. Woe to us, for we have sinned!
<sup>17</sup> Because of this our heart has been sick, Because of these our eyes have become dim,
<sup>18</sup> Because of Mount Tsiyon which is laid waste; Foxes have gone roaming in it.
<sup>19</sup> You, O יהוה, remain forever, Your throne from generation to generation.
<sup>20</sup> Why do You forget us forever, Forsake us for length of days?
<sup>21</sup> Turn us back to You, O יהוה, And let us turn back, Renew our days as of old.
<sup>22</sup> You have been wroth with us, exceedingly!
