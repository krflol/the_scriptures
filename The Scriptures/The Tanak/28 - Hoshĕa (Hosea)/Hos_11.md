<sup>1</sup> “When Yisra’ĕl was a child, I loved him, and out of Mitsrayim I called My son.
<sup>2</sup> “They called to them, so they went from their face. They slaughtered to the Ba‛als, and burned incense to carved images.
<sup>3</sup> “And I taught Ephrayim to walk, taking them by their arms, but they did not know that I healed them.
<sup>4</sup> “I drew them with ropes of man, with cords of love, and I was to them as those who take the yoke from their neck. And I bent down, fed them.
<sup>5</sup> “No, let him return to the land of Mitsrayim, and let Ashshur be his sovereign, because they refused to repent!
<sup>6</sup> “And the sword shall whirl in his cities, and it shall demolish his gate bars, and consume, because of their own counsels.
<sup>7</sup> “My people are bent towards backsliding from Me. Though they call to the Most High, He lifts none of them up.
<sup>8</sup> “How could I give you up, Ephrayim? How could I hand you over, Yisra’ĕl? How could I make you like Aḏmah? How could I set you like Tseḇoyim? My heart turns within Me, all My compassion is kindled.
<sup>9</sup> “I shall not let the heat of My wrath burn, I shall not turn to destroy Ephrayim. For I am Ĕl, and not man, the Set-apart One in your midst, and I shall not come in enmity.
<sup>10</sup> “Let them follow יהוה. Like a lion He roars. When He roars, then sons shall tremble from the west.
<sup>11</sup> “They shall tremble like a bird from Mitsrayim, and like a dove from the land of Ashshur. And I shall let them dwell in their own houses,” declares יהוה.
<sup>12</sup> “Ephrayim has surrounded Me with lying, and the house of Yisra’ĕl with deceit. But Yehuḏah is still wandering with Ĕl, and is true to the Set-apart One.”
