<sup>1</sup> Children, listen to the discipline of a father, And give attention to know understanding;
<sup>2</sup> For I gave you good instruction: Do not forsake my Torah.
<sup>3</sup> For I was my father’s son, Tender and the only one in the eyes of my mother,
<sup>4</sup> Then he taught me and said to me, “Let your heart hold fast my words; Guard my commands, and live.
<sup>5</sup> “Get wisdom! Get understanding! Do not forget, and do not turn away From the words of my mouth.
<sup>6</sup> “Do not leave her, and let her guard you; Love her, and let her watch over you.
<sup>7</sup> “The beginning of wisdom is: Get wisdom! And with all your getting, get understanding.
<sup>8</sup> “Exalt her, and let her uplift you; She brings you esteem when you embrace her.
<sup>9</sup> “She gives your head a fair wreath, She shields you with an adorning crown.”
<sup>10</sup> Hear, my son, and accept my words, And let the years of your life be many.
<sup>11</sup> I have taught you in the way of wisdom, I have led you in straight paths.
<sup>12</sup> When you walk your steps shall not be hindered, And if you run you shall not stumble.
<sup>13</sup> Hold fast to discipline, do not let go; Watch over her, for she is your life.
<sup>14</sup> Do not enter the path of the wrong, And do not walk in the way of evil-doers.
<sup>15</sup> Avoid it, do not pass by it; Turn away from it and pass on.
<sup>16</sup> For they do not sleep unless they have done evil. And their sleep is taken away unless they make someone fall.
<sup>17</sup> For they have eaten the bread of wrongdoing, And they drink the wine of violence.
<sup>18</sup> But the path of the righteous is like the light of dawn, That shines ever brighter unto the perfect day.
<sup>19</sup> The way of the wrong is like darkness; They do not know at what they stumble.
<sup>20</sup> My son, listen to my words; Incline your ear to my sayings.
<sup>21</sup> Let them not depart from your eyes; Guard them in the midst of your heart;
<sup>22</sup> For they are life to those who find them, And healing to all their flesh.
<sup>23</sup> Watch over your heart with all diligence, For out of it are the sources of life.
<sup>24</sup> Turn away from you a crooked mouth, And put perverse lips far from you.
<sup>25</sup> Let your eyes look forward, And your eyelids look straight before you.
<sup>26</sup> Consider the path of your feet, And all your ways are established.
<sup>27</sup> Do not turn to the right or the left; Turn your foot away from evil.
