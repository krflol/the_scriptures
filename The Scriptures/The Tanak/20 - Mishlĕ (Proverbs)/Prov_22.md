<sup>1</sup> A good name is preferable to great riches. Favour is better than silver and gold.
<sup>2</sup> The rich and the poor meet together – יהוה is the Maker of them all.
<sup>3</sup> A clever one foresees evil and hides himself, But the simple go on and are punished.
<sup>4</sup> The reward of humility is the fear of יהוה, Riches, and esteem and life.
<sup>5</sup> Thorns, snares are in the way of the perverse; He who guards his life keeps far away from them.
<sup>6</sup> Train up a child in the way he should go, Even when he is old he turns not away from it.
<sup>7</sup> The rich rules over the poor, And the borrower is servant to the lender.
<sup>8</sup> He who sows unrighteousness reaps trouble, And the rod of his wrath perishes.
<sup>9</sup> He who has a good eye is blessed, For he gives of his bread to the poor.
<sup>10</sup> Cast out the scoffer and strife goes out, And contention and shame cease.
<sup>11</sup> He who loves cleanness of heart, Whose speech is pleasant, A sovereign is his friend.
<sup>12</sup> The eyes of יהוה shall watch over knowledge, But He overthrows the words of the treacherous.
<sup>13</sup> The lazy one says, “There is a lion outside! I am going to be killed in the streets!”
<sup>14</sup> The mouth of a strange woman is a deep pit; The one denounced by יהוה falls in there.
<sup>15</sup> Folly is bound up in the heart of a child; The rod of discipline drives it far from him.
<sup>16</sup> One oppresses the poor to increase his wealth, Another gives to the rich, only to come to poverty.
<sup>17</sup> Incline your ear and hear the words of the wise, And apply your heart to my knowledge;
<sup>18</sup> For they are pleasant If you guard them within you; Let all of them be ready on your lips.
<sup>19</sup> I caused you to know today, even you:
<sup>20</sup> Have I not previously written to you Of counsels and knowledge,
<sup>21</sup> To cause you to know The certainty of the words of truth, To return words of truth to those who send to you?
<sup>22</sup> Do not rob the poor because he is poor, And oppress not the afflicted at the gate.
<sup>23</sup> For יהוה pleads their cause, And shall plunder those who plunder them.
<sup>24</sup> Make no friendship with one given to wrath, And do not go with a man of rage,
<sup>25</sup> Lest you learn his ways, And find yourself ensnared.
<sup>26</sup> Do not be one of those who shakes hands in a pledge, One of those who are guarantors for debts.
<sup>27</sup> If you do not have the means to pay, Why should he take away your bed from under you?
<sup>28</sup> Do not move the ancient boundary Which your fathers have set.
<sup>29</sup> Do you see a man who is skilled in his work? He does stand before sovereigns, He does not stand before obscure ones.
