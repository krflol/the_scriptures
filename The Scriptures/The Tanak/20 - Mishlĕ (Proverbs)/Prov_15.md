<sup>2</sup> The tongue of the wise makes knowledge good, But the mouth of fools pours out foolishness.
<sup>3</sup> The eyes of יהוה are in every place, Watching the evil and the good.
<sup>4</sup> A healing tongue is a tree of life, But perverseness in it crushes the spirit.
<sup>5</sup> A fool despises his father’s discipline, But he who heeds reproof is clever.
<sup>6</sup> The household of the righteous is a great treasure, But in the income of the wrong is trouble.
<sup>7</sup> The lips of the wise scatter knowledge, But the heart of fools is not so.
<sup>8</sup> The slaughtering of the wrong ones Is an abomination to יהוה, But the prayer of the straight is His delight.
<sup>9</sup> The way of the wrong one Is an abomination to יהוה, But He loves him who pursues righteousness.
<sup>10</sup> Discipline is grievous to him who forsakes the way; He who hates reproof dies.
<sup>11</sup> The grave and destruction are before יהוה, How much more the hearts of the sons of men.
<sup>12</sup> A scoffer does not love his reprover, Nor does he go to the wise.
<sup>13</sup> A glad heart makes good a face, But by sorrow of heart the spirit is stricken.
<sup>14</sup> The heart of the understanding one seeks knowledge, But the mouth of fools feeds on folly.
<sup>15</sup> All the days of the afflicted are evil, But gladness of heart is a continual feast.
<sup>16</sup> Better is a little with the fear of יהוה, Than great treasure with trouble.
<sup>17</sup> Better is a meal of vegetables where love is, Than a fatted calf with hatred.
<sup>18</sup> A man of wrath stirs up strife, But he who is patient appeases strife.
<sup>19</sup> The way of a lazy one is like a hedge of thorns, But the way of the straight is a highway.
<sup>20</sup> A wise son makes a father glad, But a foolish man despises his mother.
<sup>21</sup> Folly is joy to one lacking heart, But a man of understanding walks straight.
<sup>22</sup> Without counsel, plans go wrong, But by great counsellors they are established.
<sup>23</sup> A man has joy by the answer of his mouth, And how good is a word spoken in its season!
<sup>24</sup> The path of life is upward for the wise, To turn away from the grave below.
<sup>25</sup> יהוה tears down the house of the proud, And He sets up the boundary of the widow.
<sup>26</sup> Evil thoughts are an abomination to יהוה, But pleasant words are clean.
<sup>27</sup> He who is greedy for gain, troubles his own house, But he who hates bribes lives.
<sup>28</sup> The heart of the righteous ponders how to answer, But the mouth of the wrong pours out evil.
<sup>29</sup> יהוה is far from the wrong ones, But He hears the prayer of the righteous.
<sup>30</sup> The light of the eyes rejoices the heart, A good report gives marrow to the bones.
<sup>31</sup> An ear that hears the reproof of life Does dwell among the wise.
<sup>32</sup> He who ignores discipline hates himself, But he who listens to reproof gets understanding.
<sup>33</sup> The fear of יהוה is the discipline of wisdom, And before esteem is humility.
