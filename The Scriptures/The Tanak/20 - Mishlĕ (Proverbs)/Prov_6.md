<sup>1</sup> My son, if you: Have become guarantor for your friend, Have shaken hands in pledge for a stranger,
<sup>2</sup> Have been snared by the words of your own mouth, Have been caught by the words of your mouth –
<sup>3</sup> Do this at once, my son, and deliver yourself, For you have come into the hand of your friend: Go, humble yourself, and urge your friend.
<sup>4</sup> Give no sleep to your eyes, Nor slumber to your eyelids.
<sup>5</sup> Deliver yourself like a gazelle from the hunter’s hand, And like a bird from the hand of the trapper.
<sup>6</sup> Go to the ant, you lazy one! See her ways and be wise,
<sup>7</sup> Which, having no commander, overseer or ruler,
<sup>8</sup> Provides her supplies in the summer, Gathers her food in the harvest.
<sup>9</sup> How long would you lie down, O lazy one? When do you arise from your sleep?
<sup>10</sup> A little sleep, a little slumber, A little folding of the hands to lie down;
<sup>11</sup> And your poverty shall come like a prowler, And your need as an armed man.
<sup>12</sup> A man of Beliya‛al, a wicked man, Walks with a perverse mouth,
<sup>13</sup> Winks with his eyes, shuffles his feet, Points with his fingers;
<sup>14</sup> Perverseness is in his heart, Plotting evil at all times, He sends out strife.
<sup>15</sup> Therefore his calamity comes suddenly; Instantly he is broken, And there is no healing.
<sup>16</sup> These six matters יהוה hates, And seven are an abomination to Him:
<sup>17</sup> A proud look, A lying tongue, And hands shedding innocent blood,
<sup>18</sup> A heart devising wicked schemes, Feet quick to run to evil,
<sup>19</sup> A false witness breathing out lies, And one who causes strife among brothers.
<sup>20</sup> My son, watch over your father’s command, And do not forsake the Torah of your mother.
<sup>21</sup> Bind them on your heart always; Tie them around your neck.
<sup>22</sup> When you are walking about, it leads you; When you lie down, it guards you. And when you have woken up, It talks to you.
<sup>23</sup> For the command is a lamp, And the Torah a light, And reproofs of discipline a way of life,
<sup>24</sup> To guard you against an evil woman, From the flattering tongue of a strange woman.
<sup>25</sup> Do not desire her prettiness in your heart, Neither let her captivate you with her eyelids.
<sup>26</sup> For because of a whore One is brought to a crust of bread. And an adulteress hunts a precious life.
<sup>27</sup> Would a man take fire to his bosom, And his garments not be burned?
<sup>28</sup> Would a man walk on hot coals, And his feet not be scorched?
<sup>29</sup> So is he who goes in to his neighbour’s wife; None who touches her goes unpunished.
<sup>30</sup> They do not despise a thief If he steals to satisfy his appetite when he is starving.
<sup>31</sup> Yet if he is caught he repays sevenfold; He gives all the wealth of his house.
<sup>32</sup> He who commits adultery with a woman lacks heart; He who does it destroys his own life.
<sup>33</sup> He finds smiting and shame, And his reproach is not wiped away.
<sup>34</sup> For jealousy enrages a man, And he does not spare in the day of vengeance.
<sup>35</sup> He does not regard any ransom, Nor accept your bribe, however great!
