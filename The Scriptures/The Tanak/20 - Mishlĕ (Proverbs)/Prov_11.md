<sup>1</sup> A false scale is an abomination to יהוה, But a perfect weight is His delight.
<sup>2</sup> Pride comes, then comes shame; But with the humble is wisdom.
<sup>3</sup> The integrity of the straight ones guides them, But the slipperiness of the treacherous destroys them.
<sup>4</sup> Riches do not profit in the day of wrath, But righteousness delivers from death.
<sup>5</sup> The righteousness of the perfect Makes his way straight, But by his own wrongness the wrong one falls.
<sup>6</sup> The righteousness of the straight ones delivers them, But the treacherous are caught by greed.
<sup>7</sup> When a wrong man dies, expectancy perishes, And the ambition of the wicked shall be lost.
<sup>8</sup> The righteous is delivered from distress, And the wrong one takes his place.
<sup>9</sup> The defiled one destroys his neighbour with his mouth, But the righteous is delivered by knowledge.
<sup>10</sup> When the righteous prosper, the city rejoices. And when the wrong perish, there is shouting.
<sup>11</sup> By the blessing of the straight the city is exalted, But by the mouth of the wrong it is overthrown.
<sup>12</sup> He who lacks heart despises his neighbour, But a man of understanding keeps silence.
<sup>13</sup> A slanderer is a revealer of secrets, But one with a trustworthy spirit conceals a matter.
<sup>14</sup> Without guidance the people fall, But in a great counsellor there is safety.
<sup>15</sup> He who is guarantor for a stranger suffers harm, But one who hates shaking hands in pledge is safe.
<sup>16</sup> A woman showing favour obtains esteem, But ruthless men obtain riches.
<sup>17</sup> A kind man is rewarding his being, But he who is cruel troubles his own flesh.
<sup>18</sup> The wrong one earns false wages, But the one sowing righteousness, a true reward.
<sup>19</sup> Thus righteousness leads to life, And one pursuing evil, to his own death.
<sup>20</sup> The perverse of heart are an abomination to יהוה, But the perfect in the Way are His delight.
<sup>21</sup> Hand to hand, the evil one does not go unpunished, But the seed of the righteous shall escape.
<sup>22</sup> Like a ring of gold in a pig’s snout, Is a lovely woman who lacks good sense.
<sup>23</sup> The desire of the righteous is only good, The expectancy of the wrong is wrath.
<sup>24</sup> There is one who scatters, yet increases more. And one who withholds more than is right, But it comes to poverty.
<sup>25</sup> The generous being is enriched, And he who waters is also watered himself.
<sup>26</sup> The people curse him who withholds grain, But blessing is on the head of him who sells it.
<sup>27</sup> He who earnestly seeks good, Seeks what is pleasing; But to him who seeks evil, It comes to him.
<sup>28</sup> He who trusts in his riches falls, But the righteous flourish like a leaf.
<sup>29</sup> He who troubles his own house inherits wind, And the fool is servant to the wise of heart.
<sup>30</sup> The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life, And he who is winning lives is wise.
<sup>31</sup> See, the righteous in the earth shall be rewarded, How much more the wrong and the sinner!
