<sup>1</sup> Better is a dry piece of bread and rest with it, Than a house filled with the offerings of strife.
<sup>2</sup> A wise servant rules over a son who causes shame, And shares an inheritance among the brothers.
<sup>3</sup> A refining pot is for silver and a furnace for gold, But יהוה tries the hearts.
<sup>4</sup> An evil-doer gives heed to wicked lips; A liar gives ear to a tongue of desire.
<sup>5</sup> He who mocks the poor reproaches his Maker; He who rejoices at calamity does not go unpunished.
<sup>6</sup> Children’s children are the crown of old men, And the adornment of children is their fathers.
<sup>7</sup> Excellent speech is not fitting for a fool, Much less lying lips for a noble.
<sup>8</sup> A bribe is a stone of favour in the eyes of its owner; Wherever he turns, he prospers.
<sup>9</sup> He who covers a transgression seeks love, But he who repeats a matter separates intimate friends.
<sup>10</sup> Reproof enters deeper into a wise man Than a hundred blows on a fool.
<sup>11</sup> An evil one seeks only rebellion, So a cruel messenger is sent against him.
<sup>12</sup> Let a bereaved bear meet a man, Rather than a fool in his folly.
<sup>13</sup> Whoever rewards evil for good, Evil does not leave his house.
<sup>14</sup> The beginning of strife is like releasing water; Therefore stop fighting before it breaks out.
<sup>15</sup> He who declares the wrong right, And he who condemns the righteous, Both of them are an abomination to יהוה.
<sup>16</sup> Why is this – a price in the hand Of a fool to buy wisdom, When there is no heart?
<sup>17</sup> A friend loves at all times, And a brother is born for adversity.
<sup>18</sup> A man lacking heart shakes hands in a pledge, He becomes a guarantor for his friend.
<sup>19</sup> He who loves transgression loves strife, He who exalts his door seeks destruction.
<sup>20</sup> He who has a crooked heart finds no good, And he who has a perverse tongue falls into evil.
<sup>21</sup> He who brings forth a fool has sorrow for it, And the father of a fool has no joy.
<sup>22</sup> A rejoicing heart causes good healing, But a stricken spirit dries the bones.
<sup>23</sup> One who is wrong accepts a bribe behind the back To pervert the paths of right-ruling.
<sup>24</sup> Wisdom is before the face of the understanding one, But the eyes of a fool are on the ends of the earth.
<sup>25</sup> A foolish son is a grief to his father, And bitterness to her who bore him.
<sup>26</sup> It is also not good to punish the righteous one, To smite noble ones for straightness.
<sup>27</sup> He who has knowledge spares his words, And a man of understanding is cool of spirit.
<sup>28</sup> Even a fool keeping silence is regarded as wise, As understanding, when he closes his lips.
