<sup>1</sup> But the children of Yisra’ĕl committed a trespass regarding that which is under the ban, for Aḵan son of Karmi, son of Zaḇdi, son of Zeraḥ, of the tribe of Yehuḏah, took of that which is under the ban. And the displeasure of יהוה burned against the children of Yisra’ĕl.

<sup>2</sup> Now Yehoshua sent men from Yeriḥo to Ai, which is beside Bĕyth Awen, on the east side of Bĕyth Ĕl, and spoke to them, saying, “Go up and spy out the land.” And the men went up and spied out Ai.

<sup>3</sup> And they returned to Yehoshua and said to him, “Let not all the people go up, but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai. Do not make all the people toil up there, for the people of Ai are few.”

<sup>4</sup> And about three thousand men went up there from the people, but they fled before the men of Ai.

<sup>5</sup> And the men of Ai smote about thirty-six men, for they pursued them from before the gate as far as Sheḇarim, and smote them on the descent. So the hearts of the people melted and became like water.

<sup>6</sup> And Yehoshua tore his garments, and fell to the earth on his face before the ark of יהוה until evening, both he and the elders of Yisra’ĕl, and they put dust on their heads.

<sup>7</sup> And Yehoshua said, “Oh Master יהוה, why have You brought this people over the Yardĕn at all, to give us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? If only we had been content to stay beyond the Yardĕn!

<sup>8</sup> “O יהוה, what do I say when Yisra’ĕl turns its back before its enemies,

<sup>9</sup> and the Kena‛anites and all the inhabitants of the land hear, and shall surround us, and cut off our name from the earth. What then do You do for Your great Name?”

<sup>10</sup> And יהוה said to Yehoshua, “Rise up! Why are you lying on your face?

<sup>11</sup> “Yisra’ĕl has sinned, and they have also transgressed My covenant which I commanded them. And they have even taken some of that which is under the ban, and have both stolen and deceived, and also put it among their own goods.

<sup>12</sup> “And the sons of Yisra’ĕl shall not be able to stand before their enemies. They are going to turn their backs before their enemies, for they have become accursed. I am not with you any more, unless you destroy that which is under the ban from your midst.

<sup>13</sup> “Rise up, set the people apart, and you shall say, ‘Set yourselves apart for tomorrow, because thus said יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, “That which is under the ban is in your midst, O Yisra’ĕl. You are not able to stand before your enemies until you put away that which is under the ban out of your midst.”

<sup>14</sup> ‘And you shall be brought near in the morning, according to your tribes. And it shall be, the tribe which יהוה takes comes according to clans. And the clan which יהוה takes comes by households. And the household which יהוה takes comes by men.

<sup>15</sup> ‘And it shall be that he who is taken with that which is under the ban is burned with fire, he and all that he has, because he has transgressed the covenant of יהוה, and because he has committed wickedness in Yisra’ĕl.’ ”

<sup>16</sup> So Yehoshua arose early in the morning and brought Yisra’ĕl by their tribes, and the tribe of Yehuḏah was taken,

<sup>17</sup> and he brought the clan of Yehuḏah, and he took the clan of the Zarḥites. And he brought the clan of the Zarḥites by men, and Zaḇdi was taken.

<sup>18</sup> And he brought his household by men, and Aḵan son of Karmi, son of Zaḇdi, son of Zeraḥ, of the tribe of Yehuḏah, was taken.

<sup>19</sup> Then Yehoshua said to Aḵan, “My son, now give esteem to יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, and make confession to Him. And please declare to me what you have done, do not hide it from me.”

<sup>20</sup> So Aḵan answered Yehoshua and said, “Truly, I have sinned against יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, and this is what I did:

<sup>21</sup> “When I saw among the spoil a lovely garment from Shin‛ar, and two hundred sheqels of silver, and a wedge of gold weighing fifty sheqels, I coveted them and took them. And see, they are hidden in the ground in the midst of my tent, with the silver under it.”

<sup>22</sup> And Yehoshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent. And see, it was hidden in his tent, with the silver under it.

<sup>23</sup> And they took them from the midst of the tent, brought them to Yehoshua and to all the children of Yisra’ĕl, and laid them out before יהוה.

<sup>24</sup> Then Yehoshua, and all Yisra’ĕl with him, took Aḵan son of Zeraḥ, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his donkeys, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had, and they brought them to the Valley of Aḵor.

<sup>25</sup> And Yehoshua said, “Why have you troubled us? יהוה does trouble you today!” Then all Yisra’ĕl stoned him with stones. And they burned them with fire after they had stoned them with stones.

<sup>26</sup> And they raised over him a great heap of stones, which remains to this day. Then יהוה turned from the fierceness of His displeasure. Therefore the name of that place has been called the Valley of Aḵor to this day.

<sup>1</sup> But the children of Yisra’ĕl committed a trespass regarding that which is under the ban, for Aḵan son of Karmi, son of Zaḇdi, son of Zeraḥ, of the tribe of Yehuḏah, took of that which is under the ban. And the displeasure of יהוה burned against the children of Yisra’ĕl.

<sup>2</sup> Now Yehoshua sent men from Yeriḥo to Ai, which is beside Bĕyth Awen, on the east side of Bĕyth Ĕl, and spoke to them, saying, “Go up and spy out the land.” And the men went up and spied out Ai.

<sup>4</sup> And about three thousand men went up there from the people, but they fled before the men of Ai.

<sup>5</sup> And the men of Ai smote about thirty-six men, for they pursued them from before the gate as far as Sheḇarim, and smote them on the descent. So the hearts of the people melted and became like water.

<sup>6</sup> And Yehoshua tore his garments, and fell to the earth on his face before the ark of יהוה until evening, both he and the elders of Yisra’ĕl, and they put dust on their heads.

<sup>7</sup> And Yehoshua said, “Oh Master יהוה, why have You brought this people over the Yardĕn at all, to give us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? If only we had been content to stay beyond the Yardĕn!

<sup>16</sup> So Yehoshua arose early in the morning and brought Yisra’ĕl by their tribes, and the tribe of Yehuḏah was taken,

<sup>17</sup> and he brought the clan of Yehuḏah, and he took the clan of the Zarḥites. And he brought the clan of the Zarḥites by men, and Zaḇdi was taken.

<sup>18</sup> And he brought his household by men, and Aḵan son of Karmi, son of Zaḇdi, son of Zeraḥ, of the tribe of Yehuḏah, was taken.
