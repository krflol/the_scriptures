<sup>9</sup> The inheritance of the children of Shim‛on was out of the portion of the children of Yehuḏah, for the portion of the children of Yehuḏah was too much for them. So the children of Shim‛on had their inheritance within their inheritance.

<sup>30</sup> And Ummah, and Aphĕq, and Reḥoḇ were included – twenty-two cities with their villages.

<sup>31</sup> This was the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ashĕr for their clans, these cities with their villages.

<sup>32</sup> The sixth lot came out to the children of Naphtali, for the children of Naphtali for their clans.

<sup>33</sup> And their border was from Ḥeleph, from the terebinth tree in Tsa’anannim, and Aḏami Neqeḇ, and Yaḇne’ĕl, as far as Laqqum, and it ended at the Yardĕn.

<sup>34</sup> And the border turned westward to Aznoth Taḇor, and went out from there toward Ḥuqqoq, and reached to Zeḇulun on the south side and Ashĕr on the west side, and ended at Yehuḏah by the Yardĕn toward the sunrise.

<sup>47</sup> And the border of the children of Dan went out from them. And the children of Dan went up to fight against Leshem and captured it. And they smote it with the edge of the sword, and possessed it, and dwelt in it, and called it Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan their father.

<sup>48</sup> This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan for their clans, these cities with their villages.

<sup>49</sup> And when they had ended dividing the land as an inheritance according to their borders, the children of Yisra’ĕl gave an inheritance to Yehoshua son of Nun in their midst.

<sup>50</sup> According to the mouth of יהוה they gave him the city which he asked for, Timnath Seraḥ in the mountains of Ephrayim. And he built the city and dwelt in it.

<sup>51</sup> These were the inheritances which El‛azar the priest, and Yehoshua son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Yisra’ĕl divided as an inheritance by lot in Shiloh before יהוה, at the door of the Tent of Meeting. And they ended dividing the country.
