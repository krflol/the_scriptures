<sup>1</sup> And the lot of the tribe of the children of Yehuḏah for their clans was to the border of Eḏom, the Wilderness of Tsin southward in the extreme south.

<sup>2</sup> And their southern border began at the edge of the Salt Sea, from the bay that faces southward.

<sup>3</sup> And it went out to the southern side of the Ascent of Aqrabbim, passed over to Tsin, and went up on the south side of Qaḏĕsh Barnĕa, and passed over to Ḥetsron, went up to Aḏar, and went around to Qarqa,

<sup>4</sup> and passed over to Atsmon, and went out to the wadi of Mitsrayim, and the border ended at the sea. This is your southern border.

<sup>5</sup> And the east border was the Salt Sea as far as the end of the Yardĕn. And the border on the northern quarter began at the bay of the sea at the end of the Yardĕn.

<sup>6</sup> And the border went up to Bĕyth Ḥoḡlah and passed over north of Bĕyth Araḇah. And the border went up to the stone of Bohan son of Re’uḇĕn.

<sup>7</sup> And the border went up toward Deḇir from the Valley of Aḵor, and it turned northward toward Gilgal, which is before the Ascent of Aḏummim, which is south of the wadi. And the border passed over to the waters of Ĕn Shemesh and ended at Ĕn Roḡĕl.

<sup>8</sup> And the border went up by the Valley of the Son of Hinnom to the southern slope of the Yeḇusite city, that is Yerushalayim. And the border went up to the top of the mountain that lies before the Valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the end of the Valley of Repha’im northward.

<sup>9</sup> And the border went around from the top of the hill to the fountain of the water of Nephtowaḥ, and went up to the cities of Mount Ephron. And the border went around to Ba‛alah, that is Qiryath Ye‛arim.

<sup>10</sup> And the border turned around from Ba‛alah westward to Mount Sĕ‛ir, and passed over to the side of Mount Ye‛arim on the north, that is Kesalon, and went down to Bĕyth Shemesh, and passed over to Timnah.

<sup>11</sup> And the border went out to the side of Eqron northward. And the border went around to Shikkeron, and passed over to Mount Ba‛alah, and went out to Yaḇne’ĕl. And the border ended at the sea.

<sup>12</sup> And the west border was the coastline of the Great Sea. This is the boundary of the children of Yehuḏah all around for their clans.

<sup>13</sup> And to Kalĕḇ son of Yephunneh he gave a portion in the midst of the children of Yehuḏah, according to the command of יהוה to Yehoshua: Qiryath Arba, that is Ḥeḇron – Arba was the father of Anaq.

<sup>14</sup> And Kalĕḇ drove out the three sons of Anaq from there: Shĕshai, and Aḥiman, and Talmai, the children of Anaq.

<sup>15</sup> And he went up from there to the inhabitants of Deḇir, and the name of Deḇir formerly was Qiryath Sĕpher.

<sup>16</sup> And Kalĕḇ said, “He who smites Qiryath Sĕpher and shall capture it, to him I shall give Aḵsah my daughter as wife.”

<sup>17</sup> And Othni’ĕl son of Qenaz, the brother of Kalĕḇ, did capture it, so he gave him Aḵsah his daughter as wife.

<sup>18</sup> And it came to be, when she came to him, that she persuaded him to ask her father for a field. And when she got off from the donkey, Kalĕḇ said to her, “What is the matter?”

<sup>19</sup> And she said, “Give me a blessing. Since you have given me land in the South, give me also fountains of water.” And he gave her the upper fountains and the lower fountains.

<sup>20</sup> This was the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Yehuḏah for their clans:
