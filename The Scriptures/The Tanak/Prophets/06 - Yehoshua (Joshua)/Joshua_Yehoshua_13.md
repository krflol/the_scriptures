<sup>1</sup> And Yehoshua was old, advanced in years. And יהוה said to him, “You are old, advanced in years, and still much of the land remains to be possessed.

<sup>2</sup> “This is the land that remains: all the districts of the Philistines and all the Geshurites,

<sup>3</sup> from Shiḥor which is in front of Mitsrayim, and up to the border of Eqron northward, are considered as Kena‛anite – the five princes of the Philistines, the Azzathites, and the Ashdoḏites, the Eshqelonites, the Gittites, and the Eqronites; also the Awwites

<sup>4</sup> on the south; all the land of the Kena‛anites, and Me‛arah that belongs to the Tsiḏonians as far as Aphĕq, to the border of the Amorites;

<sup>5</sup> and the land of the Geḇalites, and all Leḇanon, toward the sunrise, from Ba‛al Gaḏ below Mount Ḥermon as far as the entrance to Ḥamath;

<sup>6</sup> all the inhabitants of the mountains from Leḇanon as far as Misrephoth Mayim, and all the Tsiḏonians. I Myself drive them out from before the children of Yisra’ĕl. Only, divide it by lot to Yisra’ĕl as an inheritance, as I have commanded you.

<sup>7</sup> “And now, divide this land as an inheritance to the nine tribes and half the tribe of Menashsheh.”

<sup>8</sup> With them the other half tribe the Re’uḇĕnites and the Gaḏites received their inheritance, which Mosheh had given them, beyond the Yardĕn eastward, as Mosheh the servant of יהוה had given them:

<sup>9</sup> from Aro‛ĕr which is on the bank of the wadi Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the wadi, and all the plain of Mĕyḏeḇa as far as Diḇon;

<sup>10</sup> and all the cities of Siḥon sovereign of the Amorites, who reigned in Ḥeshbon, as far as the border of the children of Ammon;

<sup>11</sup> and Gil‛aḏ, and the border of the Geshurites, and of the Ma‛aḵathites, and all Mount Ḥermon, and all Bashan as far as Salḵah;

<sup>12</sup> all the reign of Oḡ in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and Eḏre‛i, who remained of the remnant of the Repha’ites, for Mosheh had smitten and dispossessed them.

<sup>13</sup> However, the children of Yisra’ĕl did not drive out the Geshurites nor the Ma‛aḵathites, so the Geshurites and the Ma‛aḵathites dwell in the midst of Yisra’ĕl to this day.

<sup>14</sup> Only to the tribe of Lĕwi he had given no inheritance – the offerings made by fire to יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl were their inheritance, as He said to them.

<sup>15</sup> And Mosheh gave to the tribe of the children of Re’uḇĕn, for their clans:

<sup>16</sup> and their border was from Aro‛ĕr, which is on the bank of the wadi Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the wadi, and all the plain by Mĕyḏeḇa,

<sup>17</sup> Ḥeshbon and all its cities that are in the plain: Diḇon, and Bamoth Ba‛al, and Bĕyth Ba‛al Me‛on,

<sup>18</sup> and Yahtsah, and Qeḏĕmoth, and Mĕpha‛ath,

<sup>19</sup> and Qiryathayim, and Siḇmah, and Tsereth Shaḥar on the mountain of the valley,

<sup>20</sup> and Bĕyth Pe‛or, and the slopes of Pisgah, and Bĕyth Yeshimoth;

<sup>21</sup> and all the cities of the tableland, and all the reign of Siḥon sovereign of the Amorites, who reigned in Ḥeshbon, whom Mosheh had smitten with the princes of Miḏyan: Ewi, and Reqem, and Tsur, and Ḥur, and Reḇa, princes of Siḥon dwelling in the land.

<sup>22</sup> And the sons of Yisra’ĕl killed with the sword Bil‛am son of Be‛or, the diviner, among those who were killed by them.

<sup>23</sup> And the border of the children of Re’uḇĕn was the bank of the Yardĕn. This was the inheritance of the children of Re’uḇĕn for their clans, the cities and their villages.

<sup>24</sup> And Mosheh gave to the tribe of Gaḏ, to the children of Gaḏ for their clans:

<sup>25</sup> and their border was Ya‛zĕr, and all the cities of Gil‛aḏ, and half the land of the children of Ammon as far as Aro‛ĕr, which is before Rabbah,

<sup>26</sup> and from Ḥeshbon to Ramath Mitspeh and Betonim, and from Maḥanayim to the border of Deḇir,

<sup>27</sup> and in the valley Bĕyth Haram, and Bĕyth Nimrah, and Sukkoth, and Tsaphon, the rest of the reign of Siḥon sovereign of Ḥeshbon, the Yardĕn being its border, as far as the edge of the Sea of Kinnereth, beyond the Yardĕn eastward.

<sup>28</sup> This is the inheritance of the children of Gaḏ for their clans, the cities and their villages.

<sup>29</sup> And Mosheh gave to half the tribe of Menashsheh, and it was for half the tribe of the children of Menashsheh for their clans:

<sup>30</sup> and their border was from Maḥanayim, all Bashan, all the reign of Oḡ sovereign of Bashan, and all the small towns of Ya’ir which are in Bashan, sixty cities;

<sup>31</sup> and the half of Gil‛aḏ, and Ashtaroth and Eḏre‛i, cities of the reign of Oḡ in Bashan, were for the children of Maḵir son of Menashsheh, to the half of the children of Maḵir for their clans.

<sup>32</sup> These Mosheh gave as an inheritance in the desert plains of Mo’aḇ beyond the Yardĕn, by Yeriḥo eastward.

<sup>33</sup> But to the tribe of Lĕwi Mosheh gave no inheritance. יהוה, Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, He was their inheritance, as He had said to them.
