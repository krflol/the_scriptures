<sup>1</sup> Now these the children of Yisra’ĕl inherited in the land of Kena‛an, which El‛azar the priest, and Yehoshua son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Yisra’ĕl caused them to inherit.

<sup>2</sup> Their inheritance was by lot, as יהוה had commanded by the hand of Mosheh, for the nine tribes and the half-tribe.

<sup>3</sup> For Mosheh had given the inheritance of the two tribes and the half-tribe beyond the Yardĕn, but to the Lĕwites he gave no inheritance in their midst.

<sup>4</sup> For the children of Yosĕph had become two tribes: Menashsheh and Ephrayim. And they gave no part to the Lĕwites in the land, except cities to dwell in, with their open land for their livestock and their possessions.

<sup>5</sup> As יהוה had commanded Mosheh, so the children of Yisra’ĕl did, and they divided the land.

<sup>6</sup> And the children of Yehuḏah came to Yehoshua in Gilgal, and Kalĕḇ son of Yephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, “You know the word which יהוה said to Mosheh the man of Elohim concerning you and me in Qaḏĕsh Barnĕa.

<sup>7</sup> “I was forty years old when Mosheh the servant of יהוה sent me from Qaḏĕsh Barnĕa to spy out the land, and I brought back word to him as it was in my heart.

<sup>8</sup> “But my brothers who went up with me made the heart of the people melt, but I followed יהוה my Elohim completely.

<sup>9</sup> “So Mosheh swore on that day, saying, ‘The land on which your foot has trodden is your inheritance and your children’s forever, because you have followed יהוה my Elohim completely.’

<sup>10</sup> “And now, see, יהוה has kept me alive, as He said, these forty-five years since יהוה spoke this word to Mosheh while Yisra’ĕl walked in the wilderness. And now, see, I am eighty-five years old today.

<sup>11</sup> “Yet I am still as strong today as I was on the day that Mosheh sent me. As my strength was then, so my strength is now, for battle, and for going out and for coming in.

<sup>12</sup> “And now, give me this mountain of which יהוה spoke in that day, for you heard in that day how the Anaqim were there, and that the cities were great and walled. If יהוה is with me, then I shall dispossess them, as יהוה said.”

<sup>13</sup> Yehoshua then blessed him, and gave Ḥeḇron to Kalĕḇ son of Yephunneh as an inheritance.

<sup>14</sup> So Ḥeḇron became the inheritance of Kalĕḇ son of Yephunneh the Qenizzite to this day, because he followed יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl completely.

<sup>15</sup> Now the name of Ḥeḇron was formerly Qiryath Arba (Arba was the greatest man among the Anaqim). And the land had rest from fighting.
