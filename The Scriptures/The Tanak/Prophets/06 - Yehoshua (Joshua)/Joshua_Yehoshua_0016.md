<sup>1</sup> And the lot for the children of Yosĕph went out from the Yardĕn, by Yeriḥo, to the waters of Yeriḥo on the east, to the wilderness going up from Yeriḥo through the mountains to Bĕyth Ĕl,

<sup>2</sup> and went out from Bĕyth Ĕl to Luz, and passed over to the border of the Arkites at Ataroth,

<sup>3</sup> and went down westward to the boundary of the Yaphlĕtites, as far as the boundary of Lower Bĕyth Ḥoron to Gezer, and it ended at the sea.

<sup>4</sup> Thus the children of Yosĕph, Menashsheh and Ephrayim, inherited.

<sup>5</sup> And the border of the children of Ephrayim, according to their clans, was: The border of their inheritance on the east side was Ataroth Addar as far as Upper Bĕyth Ḥoron.

<sup>6</sup> And the border went out toward the sea, to Miḵmethath on the north, then the border went around eastward to Ta’anath Shiloh, and passed over it on the east of Yanoḥah,

<sup>7</sup> and went down from Yanoḥah to Ataroth and Na‛arah, reached to Yeriḥo, and came out at the Yardĕn.

<sup>8</sup> From Tappuwaḥ the border went westward to the wadi Qanah, and it ended at the sea. This was the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephrayim for their clans.

<sup>9</sup> And the separate cities for the children of Ephrayim were in the midst of the inheritance of the children of Menashsheh, all the cities with their villages.

<sup>10</sup> And they did not drive out the Kena‛anites who dwelt in Gezer, so the Kena‛anites dwell among the Ephrayimites to this day and have become compulsory labour.
