<sup>1</sup> And it came to be, a long time after יהוה had given rest to Yisra’ĕl from all their enemies round about, that Yehoshua was old, advanced in years.

<sup>2</sup> And Yehoshua called for all Yisra’ĕl, and for their elders, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers, and said to them, “I am old, advanced in years.

<sup>3</sup> “And you, you have seen all that יהוה your Elohim has done to all these nations because of you, for יהוה your Elohim is He who was fighting for you.

<sup>4</sup> “See, I have divided to you by lot these nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from the Yardĕn, with all the nations that I have cut off, as far as the Great Sea toward the setting of the sun.

<sup>5</sup> “And יהוה your Elohim thrust them out from before you, and shall drive them out from before you, and you shall possess their land, as יהוה your Elohim has promised you.

<sup>6</sup> “And you shall be very strong to guard and to do all that is written in the Book of the Torah of Mosheh, so as not to turn aside from it right or left,

<sup>7</sup> so as not to go in among these nations, these who remain among you. And make no mention of the name of their mighty ones, a nor swear by them, nor serve them nor bow down to them.

<sup>8</sup> “But cling to יהוה your Elohim, as you have done to this day.

<sup>9</sup> “For יהוה has driven out from before you great and strong nations. As for you, no one has stood against you to this day.

<sup>10</sup> “One man of you put a thousand to flight, for יהוה your Elohim is He who is fighting for you, as He has promised you.

<sup>11</sup> “And you shall diligently guard yourselves, to love יהוה your Elohim.

<sup>12</sup> “But if you do turn back at all, and cling to the remnant of these nations, these that remain among you, and intermarry with them, and go in to them and they to you,

<sup>13</sup> know for certain that יהוה your Elohim shall no longer drive these nations out from before you. And they shall be snares and traps to you, and a whip on your sides and thorns in your eyes, until you perish from this good land which יהוה your Elohim has given you.

<sup>14</sup> “And see, this day I am going the way of all the earth. And you know in all your hearts and in all your beings that not one word has failed of all the good words which יהוה your Elohim spoke concerning you. All of it has come to you, and not one word of them has failed.

<sup>15</sup> “And it shall be, that as every good word has come upon you which יהוה your Elohim promised you, so יהוה does bring upon you every evil word, until He has destroyed you from this good land which יהוה your Elohim has given you,

<sup>16</sup> when you transgress the covenant of יהוה your Elohim, which He commanded you, and shall go and serve other mighty ones, and bow down to them. And the displeasure of יהוה shall burn against you, and you shall perish quickly from the good land which He has given you.”
