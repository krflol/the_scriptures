<sup>1</sup> And it came to be, when all the sovereigns of the Amorites who were beyond the Yardĕn westward, and all the sovereigns of the Kena‛anites who were by the sea, heard that יהוה had dried up the waters of the Yardĕn from before the children of Yisra’ĕl until we had passed over, that their heart melted. And there was no spirit in them any longer, because of the children of Yisra’ĕl.

<sup>2</sup> At that time יהוה said to Yehoshua, “Make knives of flint for yourself, and circumcise the sons of Yisra’ĕl again the second time.”

<sup>3</sup> So Yehoshua made knives of flint for himself, and circumcised the sons of Yisra’ĕl at the Hill of Foreskins.

<sup>4</sup> And this is why Yehoshua circumcised them: All the people who came out of Mitsrayim who were males, all the men of battle, had died in the wilderness on the way, after they had come out of Mitsrayim.

<sup>5</sup> For all the people who came out had been circumcised, but all the people who were born in the wilderness on the way as they came out of Mitsrayim had not been circumcised.

<sup>6</sup> For the children of Yisra’ĕl walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the nation – the men of battle who came out of Mitsrayim – were consumed, because they did not obey the voice of יהוה, to whom יהוה swore not to show them the land which יהוה had sworn to their fathers that He would give us, “a land flowing with milk and honey.”

<sup>7</sup> And Yehoshua circumcised their sons whom He raised up in their place; for they were uncircumcised, because they had not been circumcised on the way.

<sup>8</sup> And it came to be, when they had completed circumcising all the nation, that they stayed in their places in the camp till they were healed.

<sup>9</sup> And יהוה said to Yehoshua, “Today I have rolled away the reproach of Mitsrayim from you.” So the name of the place is called Gilgal to this day.

<sup>10</sup> And the children of Yisra’ĕl camped in Gilgal, and performed the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening on the desert plains of Yeriḥo.

<sup>11</sup> And they ate of the stored grain of the land on the morrow after the Passover, unleavened bread and roasted grain on this same day.

<sup>12</sup> And the manna ceased on the day after they had eaten the stored grain of the land. And the children of Yisra’ĕl no longer had manna, but they ate the food of the land of Kena‛an that year.

<sup>13</sup> And it came to be, when Yehoshua was by Yeriḥo, that he lifted his eyes and looked and saw a Man standing opposite him with His sword drawn in His hand. And Yehoshua went to Him and said to Him, “Are You for us or for our adversaries?”

<sup>14</sup> And He said, “No, for I have now come as Captain of the host of יהוה.” And Yehoshua fell on his face to the earth and did obeisance, and said to Him, “What is my Master saying to His servant?”

<sup>15</sup> And the Captain of the host of יהוה said to Yehoshua, “Take your sandal off your foot, for the place where you stand is set-apart.” And Yehoshua did so.
