<sup>1</sup> And it came to be, when Yaḇin sovereign of Ḥatsor heard, that he sent to Yoḇaḇ sovereign of Maḏon, and to the sovereign of Shimron, and to the sovereign of Aḵshaph,

<sup>2</sup> and to the sovereigns who were from the north, in the mountains, and in the desert plain south of Kinneroth, and in the low country, and in the heights of Dor on the west –

<sup>3</sup> the Kena‛anites in the east and in the west, and the Amorite, and the Ḥittite, and the Perizzite, and the Yeḇusite in the mountains, and the Ḥiwwite below Ḥermon in the land of Mitspah.

<sup>4</sup> And they went out, they and all their armies with them, as many people as numerous as the sand on the seashore, with very many horses and chariots.

<sup>5</sup> And all these sovereigns met together, and they came and camped together at the waters of Mĕrom to fight against Yisra’ĕl.

<sup>6</sup> And יהוה said to Yehoshua, “Do not be afraid of their presence, for tomorrow about this time I am giving all of them over to Yisra’ĕl, slain. Hamstring their horses and burn their chariots with fire.”

<sup>7</sup> And Yehoshua, and all the soldiers with him, came against them suddenly by the waters of Mĕrom, and they fell on them.

<sup>8</sup> And יהוה gave them into the hand of Yisra’ĕl, and they smote them and pursued them to Great Tsiḏon, and to Misrephoth Mayim, and to the Valley of Mitspeh eastward. And they smote them until no survivor was left to them.

<sup>9</sup> And Yehoshua did to them as יהוה said to him: he hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots with fire.

<sup>10</sup> And Yehoshua turned back at that time and captured Ḥatsor, and smote its sovereign with the sword, for Ḥatsor was formerly the head of all those reigns.

<sup>11</sup> And they smote all the people who were in it with the edge of the sword, putting them under the ban. He did not leave anyone breathing. Then he burned Ḥatsor with fire.

<sup>12</sup> And Yehoshua captured all the cities of those sovereigns, and all their sovereigns, and he smote them with the edge of the sword. He put them under the ban, as Mosheh the servant of יהוה commanded.

<sup>13</sup> However, Yisra’ĕl did not burn any cities that stood on their mounds, but Yehoshua burned only Ḥatsor.

<sup>14</sup> And all the spoil of these cities and the livestock, the children of Yisra’ĕl took as booty for themselves. But they smote every man with the edge of the sword until they had destroyed them, and they did not leave anyone breathing.

<sup>15</sup> As יהוה had commanded Mosheh his servant, so Mosheh commanded Yehoshua, and so Yehoshua did. He did not turn aside a word of all that יהוה had commanded Mosheh.

<sup>16</sup> Thus Yehoshua took all this land: the mountain country, and all the South, and all the land of Goshen, and the low country, and the desert plain, and the mountains of Yisra’ĕl and its low lands,

<sup>17</sup> from Mount Ḥalaq that goes up to Sĕ‛ir, and as far as Ba‛al Gaḏ in the Valley of Leḇanon below Mount Ḥermon. And he captured all their sovereigns, and smote them and killed them.

<sup>18</sup> Yehoshua fought with all those sovereigns for a long time.

<sup>19</sup> There was not a city that made peace with the children of Yisra’ĕl, except the Ḥiwwites, the inhabitants of Giḇ‛on. All the others they took in battle.

<sup>20</sup> For it was of יהוה to harden their hearts, that they should come against Yisra’ĕl in battle, in order to put them under the ban, so that they might have no favour, but that He might annihilate them, as יהוה had commanded Mosheh.

<sup>21</sup> And at that time Yehoshua came and cut off the Anaqim from the mountains, from Ḥeḇron, from Deḇir, from Anaḇ, and from all the mountains of Yehuḏah, and from all the mountains of Yisra’ĕl. Yehoshua put them with their cities under the ban.

<sup>22</sup> There were none of the Anaqim left in the land of the children of Yisra’ĕl; only in Azzah, in Gath, and in Ashdoḏ some remained.

<sup>23</sup> Thus Yehoshua took the entire land, according to all that יהוה had said to Mosheh. And Yehoshua gave it as an inheritance to Yisra’ĕl according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land rested from fighting.

<sup>1</sup> And it came to be, when Yaḇin sovereign of Ḥatsor heard, that he sent to Yoḇaḇ sovereign of Maḏon, and to the sovereign of Shimron, and to the sovereign of Aḵshaph,

<sup>2</sup> and to the sovereigns who were from the north, in the mountains, and in the desert plain south of Kinneroth, and in the low country, and in the heights of Dor on the west –

<sup>4</sup> And they went out, they and all their armies with them, as many people as numerous as the sand on the seashore, with very many horses and chariots.

<sup>5</sup> And all these sovereigns met together, and they came and camped together at the waters of Mĕrom to fight against Yisra’ĕl.
