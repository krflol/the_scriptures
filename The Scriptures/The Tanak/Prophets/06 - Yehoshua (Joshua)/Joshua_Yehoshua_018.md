<sup>1</sup> And all the congregation of the children of Yisra’ĕl assembled at Shiloh, and they let the Tent of Meeting dwell there. And the land was subdued before them.

<sup>2</sup> And seven tribes were left among the children of Yisra’ĕl who had not yet shared their inheritance.

<sup>3</sup> So Yehoshua said to the children of Yisra’ĕl, “Till when are you going to fail to go in and possess the land which יהוה Elohim of your fathers has given you?

<sup>4</sup> “Appoint three men from each tribe, and let me send them out to go through the land and describe it according to their inheritance, and come back to me.

<sup>5</sup> “And they shall divide it into seven portions – Yehuḏah stays within their border on the south, and the house of Yosĕph stays within their border on the north –

<sup>6</sup> and you shall describe the land in seven portions, and shall bring it to me. Then I shall cast lots for you here before יהוה our Elohim.

<sup>7</sup> “But the Lĕwites have no portion among you, for the priesthood of יהוה is their inheritance. And Gaḏ, and Re’uḇĕn, and half the tribe of Menashsheh have received their inheritance beyond the Yardĕn on the east, which Mosheh the servant of יהוה gave them.”

<sup>8</sup> So the men rose up and went. And Yehoshua commanded those who went to describe the land, saying, “Go, walk through the land, and describe it, and come back to me, and let me cast lots for you here before יהוה in Shiloh.”

<sup>9</sup> So the men went, and passed through the land, and described it in a book in seven portions by cities. And they came to Yehoshua at the camp in Shiloh.

<sup>10</sup> And Yehoshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before יהוה, and there Yehoshua divided the land to the children of Yisra’ĕl according to their portions.

<sup>11</sup> And the lot of the tribe of the children of Binyamin came up for their clans, and the border of their lot came out between the children of Yehuḏah and the children of Yosĕph.

<sup>12</sup> And their border was on the north side from the Yardĕn, and the border went up to the side of Yeriḥo on the north, and went up through the mountains westward, and ended at the Wilderness of Bĕyth Awen.

<sup>13</sup> And the border went over from there toward Luz, to the side of Luz, that is Bĕyth Ĕl, southward. And the border went down to Ataroth Aḏar, by the hill that lies on the south side of Lower Bĕyth Ḥoron.

<sup>14</sup> And the border was drawn and went around the west side to the south, from the hill that faces Bĕyth Ḥoron southward, and it ended at Qiryath Ba‛al, that is Qiryath Ye‛arim, a city of the children of Yehuḏah. This was the west side.

<sup>15</sup> And the south side was from the end of Qiryath Ye‛arim, and the border went out westward, and went out to the fountain of the waters of Nephtowaḥ.

<sup>16</sup> And the border came down to the end of the mountain that faces the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, which is in the Valley of the Repha’im on the north, and went down to the Valley of Hinnom, to the side of the Yeḇusite city on the south, and went down to Ĕn Roḡĕl.

<sup>17</sup> And it was drawn from the north, went out to Ĕn Shemesh, and went out toward Geliloth, which is opposite the Ascent of Aḏummim, and went down to the stone of Bohan son of Re’uḇĕn,

<sup>18</sup> and passed over to the side opposite Araḇah northward, and went down to Araḇah.

<sup>19</sup> And the border passed over to the side of Bĕyth Ḥoḡlah northward, and the border ended at the north bay at the Salt Sea, at the south end of the Yardĕn. This was the southern boundary,

<sup>20</sup> and the Yardĕn borders it on the east side. This was the inheritance of the children of Binyamin, according to its boundaries all around, for their clans.

<sup>21</sup> And the cities for the tribe of the children of Binyamin, for their clans, were Yeriḥo, and Bĕyth Ḥoḡlah, and Ĕmeq Qetsits,

<sup>22</sup> and Bĕyth Araḇah, and Tsemarayim, and Bĕyth Ĕl,

<sup>23</sup> and Awwim, and Parah, and Ophrah,

<sup>24</sup> and Kephar Ha‛ammoni, and Ophni, and Gaḇa – twelve cities with their villages.

<sup>25</sup> Giḇ‛on, and Ramah, and Be’ĕroth,

<sup>26</sup> and Mitspeh, and Kephirah, and Motsah,

<sup>27</sup> and Reqem, and Yirpe’ĕl, and Taralah,

<sup>28</sup> and Tsela, Eleph, and the Yeḇusite, that is Yerushalayim, Giḇ‛ath, and Qiryath – fourteen cities with their villages. This was the inheritance of the children of Binyamin for their clans.
