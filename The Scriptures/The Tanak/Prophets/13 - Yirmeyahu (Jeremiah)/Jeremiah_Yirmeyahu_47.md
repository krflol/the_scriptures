<sup>1</sup> The word of יהוה that came to Yirmeyahu the prophet concerning the Philistines, before Pharaoh smote Azzah:

<sup>2</sup> Thus said יהוה, “See, waters are rising out of the north, and shall be an overflowing flood. And they shall overflow the land and all that is in it, the city and those who dwell within. And men shall cry, and all the inhabitants of the land shall wail.

<sup>3</sup> “At the noise of the stamping hooves of his strong horses, at the rushing of his chariots, at the rumbling of his wheels, the fathers shall not look to their children, because of weakness of hands,

<sup>4</sup> because of the day that shall come to ravage all the Philistines, to cut off from Tsor and Tsiḏon every helper that survives. For יהוה is ravaging the Philistines, the remnant of the isle of Kaphtor.

<sup>5</sup> “Baldness shall come upon Azzah, Ashqelon shall be cut off with the remnant of their valley. Till when would you cut yourself?

<sup>6</sup> “O you sword of יהוה, how long till you rest? Put yourself up into your sheath, rest and be still!

<sup>7</sup> “How shall it rest, when יהוה has given it a command? Against Ashqelon and against the seashore – there He has appointed it.”
