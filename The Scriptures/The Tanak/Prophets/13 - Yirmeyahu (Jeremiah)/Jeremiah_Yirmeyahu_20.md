<sup>1</sup> And Pashhur son of Immĕr, the priest who was also chief governor in the House of יהוה, heard that Yirmeyahu prophesied these words,

<sup>2</sup> And Pashhur smote Yirmeyahu the prophet, and put him in the stocks that were in the high gate of Binyamin, which was by the House of יהוה.

<sup>3</sup> And it came to be on the next day that Pashhur brought Yirmeyahu out of the stocks, and Yirmeyahu said to him, “ יהוה has not called your name Pashhur, but Maḡor-Missaḇiḇ.

<sup>4</sup> “For thus said יהוה, ‘See, I am making you a fear to yourself and to all your friends. And they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, while your eyes see it. And I shall give all Yehuḏah into the hand of the sovereign of Baḇel, and he shall exile them to Baḇel and slay them with the sword.

<sup>5</sup> ‘And I shall give all the wealth of this city and all its labour, and all its valuables, and all the treasures of the sovereigns of Yehuḏah, I give into the hand of their enemies, who shall plunder them, seize them, and shall bring them to Baḇel.

<sup>6</sup> ‘And you, Pashhur, and all who dwell in your house, shall go into captivity, and enter into Baḇel. And there you shall die, and be buried there, you and all your friends, to whom you have prophesied falsehood.’ ”

<sup>7</sup> O יהוה, You enticed me, and I was enticed. You are stronger than I, and have prevailed. I have been ridiculed all day long, everyone mocks me.

<sup>8</sup> For when I speak, I cry out, proclaiming violence and ruin. Because the word of יהוה was made to me a reproach and a derision daily.

<sup>9</sup> Whenever I said, “Let me not mention Him, nor speak in His Name again,” it was in my heart like a burning fire shut up in my bones. And I became weary of holding it back, and was helpless.

<sup>10</sup> For I heard many mocking, “Fear on every side!” “Expose,” they say, “yea, let us expose him!” All my friends watched for my stumbling, saying, “He might be lured away, so that we prevail against him, and take our revenge on him.”

<sup>11</sup> But יהוה is with me like a mighty, awesome one. Therefore my persecutors shall stumble, and not prevail. They shall be greatly ashamed, for they have not acted wisely – an everlasting reproach never to be forgotten.

<sup>12</sup> But, O יהוה of hosts, trying the righteous, and seeing the kidneys and heart, let me see Your vengeance on them, for I have revealed my cause to You.

<sup>13</sup> Sing to יהוה ! Praise יהוה ! For He has delivered the being of the poor from the hand of evil ones.

<sup>14</sup> Cursed be the day in which I was born! Let the day not be blessed in which my mother bore me!

<sup>15</sup> Let the man be cursed who brought news to my father, saying, “A male child has been born to you,” making him very glad.

<sup>16</sup> And let that man be like the cities which יהוה overthrew, and repented not. Let him hear the cry in the morning and the shouting at noon,

<sup>17</sup> because I was not slain from the womb, so that my mother should have been my grave and her womb forever great.

<sup>18</sup> Why did I come forth from the womb to see toil and sorrow, and spend my days in shame?
