<sup>1</sup> And it came to be in that year, at the beginning of the reign of Tsiḏqiyah sovereign of Yehuḏah, in the fourth year and in the fifth month, that Ḥananyah son of Azzur the prophet, who was from Giḇ‛on, spoke to me in the House of יהוה in the presence of the priests and of all the people, saying,

<sup>2</sup> “Thus spoke יהוה of hosts, the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, saying, ‘I have broken the yoke of the sovereign of Baḇel.

<sup>3</sup> ‘Within two years I am going to bring back to this place all the vessels of the House of יהוה, that Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar sovereign of Baḇel removed from this place and took to Baḇel.

<sup>4</sup> ‘And I am going to bring back to this place Yeḵonyah son of Yehoyaqim, sovereign of Yehuḏah, with all the exiles of Yehuḏah who went to Baḇel,’ declares יהוה, ‘for I am going to break the yoke of the sovereign of Baḇel.’ ”

<sup>5</sup> Then the prophet Yirmeyah spoke to the prophet Ḥananyah in the presence of the priests and in the presence of all the people who stood in the House of יהוה,

<sup>6</sup> and the prophet Yirmeyah said, “Amĕn! יהוה do so! יהוה establish your words which you have prophesied, to bring back the vessels of the House of יהוה and all the exiles from Baḇel to this place!

<sup>7</sup> “Only, hear now this word that I speak in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people:

<sup>8</sup> “The prophets who have been before me and before you of old prophesied against many lands and great reigns, of battle and of evil and of pestilence.

<sup>9</sup> “The prophet who prophesies of peace – when the word of the prophet comes to pass, that prophet is known as one whom יהוה has truly sent.”

<sup>10</sup> And Ḥananyah the prophet took the yoke off the prophet Yirmeyah’s neck and broke it.

<sup>11</sup> And Ḥananyah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, “Thus said יהוה, ‘So I shall break the yoke of Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar sovereign of Baḇel from the neck of all nations within two years.’ ” And the prophet Yirmeyah went his way.

<sup>12</sup> And the word of יהוה came to Yirmeyah, after Ḥananyah the prophet had broken the yoke from the neck of the prophet Yirmeyah, saying,

<sup>13</sup> “Go and speak to Ḥananyah, saying, ‘Thus said יהוה, “You have broken the yokes of wood, but you shall make yokes of iron instead.”

<sup>14</sup> ‘For thus said יהוה of hosts, the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, “I have put a yoke of iron on the neck of all these nations, to serve Neḇuḵaḏnetstsar sovereign of Baḇel. And they shall serve him. And I have also given him the beasts of the field.” ’ ”

<sup>15</sup> And the prophet Yirmeyah said to Ḥananyah the prophet, “Listen, please, Ḥananyah, יהוה has not sent you, but you have made this people trust in falsehood.

<sup>16</sup> “Therefore thus said יהוה, ‘See, I am sending you away from the face of the earth. This year you shall die, for you have spoken apostasy against יהוה.’ ”

<sup>17</sup> And Ḥananyah the prophet died the same year, in the seventh month.
