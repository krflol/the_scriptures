<sup>1</sup> And the word of יהוה came to Yirmeyahu a second time, while he was still shut up in the court of the guard, saying,

<sup>2</sup> “Thus said יהוה who made it, יהוה who formed it to establish it, יהוה is His Name,

<sup>3</sup> ‘Call unto Me, and I shall answer you, and show you great and inaccessible matters, which you have not known.’

<sup>4</sup> “For thus said יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, concerning the houses of this city and the houses of the sovereigns of Yehuḏah, which are thrown down against the siege mounds and the sword,

<sup>5</sup> while coming to fight with the Chaldeans, and to fill their places with the corpses of men whom I shall slay in My displeasure and My wrath, all for whose evil I have hidden My face from this city.

<sup>6</sup> ‘See, I am bringing to it relief and healing. And I shall heal them and reveal to them the riches of peace and truth.

<sup>7</sup> ‘And I shall turn back the captivity of Yehuḏah and the captivity of Yisra’ĕl, and shall build them as at the first,

<sup>8</sup> and shall cleanse them from all their crookedness that they have sinned against Me. And I shall pardon all their crookednesses that they have sinned and by which they have transgressed against Me.

<sup>9</sup> ‘And it shall be to Me a name of joy, a praise, and a pride before all nations of the earth, who hear all the good I am doing to them, and they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and all the peace I am doing to it.’

<sup>10</sup> “Thus said יהוה, ‘In this place of which you say, “It is dried up, without man and without beast,” in the cities of Yehuḏah, in the streets of Yerushalayim that are deserted, without man and without inhabitant and without beast, there shall once again be heard

<sup>11</sup> the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of those who are saying, “Praise יהוה of hosts, for יהוה is good, for His kindness is forever,” of those who are bringing the offering of praise into the House of יהוה. For I shall turn back the captivity of the land, as at the first,’ declares יהוה.

<sup>12</sup> “Thus said יהוה of hosts, ‘In this place which is dried up, without man and without beast, and in all its cities, there shall once again be a home of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down.

<sup>13</sup> ‘In the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the low country, and in the cities of the South, and in the land of Binyamin, and in the places around Yerushalayim, and in the cities of Yehuḏah, the flocks once again pass under the hands of him who counts them,’ declares יהוה.

<sup>14</sup> ‘See, the days are coming,’ declares יהוה, ‘when I shall establish the good word which I have promised to the house of Yisra’ĕl and to the house of Yehuḏah:

<sup>15</sup> ‘In those days and at that time I cause a Branch of righteousness to spring forth for Dawiḏ. And He shall do right-ruling and righteousness in the earth.

<sup>16</sup> ‘In those days Yehuḏah shall be saved, and Yerushalayim dwell in safety. And this is that which shall be proclaimed to her: ‘ יהוה our Righteousness.’

<sup>17</sup> “For thus said יהוה, ‘For Dawiḏ there is not to cease a man to sit on the throne of the house of Yisra’ĕl.

<sup>18</sup> ‘And for the priests, the Lĕwites, there is not to cease a man to offer burnt offerings before Me, to kindle grain offerings, and to slaughter continually.’ ”

<sup>19</sup> And the word of יהוה came to Yirmeyahu, saying,

<sup>20</sup> “Thus said יהוה, ‘If you could break My covenant with the day and My covenant with the night, so that there be not day and night in their season,

<sup>21</sup> then My covenant could also be broken with Dawiḏ My servant – so that he shall not have a son to reign upon his throne – and with the Lĕwites, the priests, My attendants.

<sup>22</sup> ‘As the host of the heavens is not counted, nor the sand of the sea measured, so I increase the descendants of Dawiḏ My servant and the Lĕwites who attend upon Me.’ ”

<sup>23</sup> And the word of יהוה came to Yirmeyahu, saying,

<sup>24</sup> “Have you not observed what these people have spoken, saying, ‘The two clans which יהוה has chosen have been rejected by Him’? So they have despised My people, no more to be a nation before them.

<sup>25</sup> “Thus said יהוה, ‘If My covenant is not with day and night, and if I have not appointed the laws of the heavens and earth,

<sup>26</sup> then I would also reject the descendants of Ya‛aqoḇ and Dawiḏ My servant, so that I should not take of his descendants to be rulers over the descendants of Aḇraham, Yitsḥaq, and Ya‛aqoḇ. For I shall turn back their captivity, and have compassion on them.’ ”
