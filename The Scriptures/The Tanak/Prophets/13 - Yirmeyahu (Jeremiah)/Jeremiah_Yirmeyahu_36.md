<sup>1</sup> And it came to be in the fourth year of Yehoyaqim son of Yoshiyahu, sovereign of Yehuḏah, that this word came to Yirmeyahu from יהוה, saying,

<sup>2</sup> “Take a scroll and write on it all the words that I have spoken to you against Yisra’ĕl, and against Yehuḏah, and against all the nations, from the day I spoke to you, from the days of Yoshiyahu even to this day.

<sup>3</sup> “It could be that the house of Yehuḏah hears of all the evil which I plan to bring upon them, so that each one turns back from his evil way, and I shall pardon their crookedness and their sin.”

<sup>4</sup> And Yirmeyahu called Baruḵ son of Nĕriyah. And Baruḵ wrote on a scroll from the mouth of Yirmeyahu, all the words of יהוה which He had spoken to him.

<sup>5</sup> And Yirmeyahu commanded Baruḵ, saying, “I am shut up, I am unable to enter the House of יהוה.

<sup>6</sup> “But you shall enter, and shall read from the scroll which you have written from my mouth, the words of יהוה, in the hearing of the people in the House of יהוה on the day of fasting. And also read them in the hearing of all Yehuḏah who come from their cities.

<sup>7</sup> “It could be that they present their supplication before יהוה, and they turn back, each one from his evil way. For great is the displeasure and the wrath that יהוה has spoken against this people.”

<sup>8</sup> And Baruḵ son of Nĕriyah did according to all that Yirmeyahu the prophet commanded him, reading from the book the words of יהוה in the House of יהוה.

<sup>9</sup> And it came to be in the fifth year of Yehoyaqim son of Yoshiyahu, sovereign of Yehuḏah, in the ninth month, that they called a fast before יהוה to all the people in Yerushalayim, and to all the people who came from the cities of Yehuḏah to Yerushalayim.

<sup>10</sup> And Baruḵ read from the book the words of Yirmeyahu in the House of יהוה, in the room of Gemaryahu son of Shaphan the scribe, in the upper courtyard at the entry of the New Gate of the House of יהוה, in the hearing of all the people.

<sup>11</sup> And Miḵayehu son of Gemaryahu, son of Shaphan, heard all the words of יהוה from the book,

<sup>12</sup> And then he went down to the sovereign’s house, into the scribe’s room. And there all the heads were sitting: Elishama the scribe, and Delayahu son of Shemayahu, and Elnathan son of Aḵbor, and Gemaryahu son of Shaphan, and Tsiḏqiyahu son of Ḥananyahu, and all the heads.

<sup>13</sup> And Miḵayehu told them all the words which he heard when Baruḵ read the book in the hearing of the people.

<sup>14</sup> Then all the heads sent Yehuḏi son of Nethanyahu, son of Shelemyahu, son of Kushi, to Baruḵ, saying, “Take in your hand the scroll from which you have read in the hearing of the people, and come.” So Baruḵ son of Nĕriyahu took the scroll in his hand and came to them.

<sup>15</sup> And they said to him, “Sit down, please, and read it in our hearing.” Then Baruḵ read it in their hearing.

<sup>16</sup> And it came to be, when they had heard all the words, that they looked at each other in fear, and said to Baruḵ, “We are certainly going to report all these words to the sovereign.”

<sup>17</sup> And they asked Baruḵ, saying, “Please explain to us, how did you write all these words? From his mouth?”

<sup>18</sup> And Baruḵ answered them, “From his mouth he spoke all these words to me, and I wrote them with ink in the book.”

<sup>19</sup> Then the heads said to Baruḵ, “Go, hide, you and Yirmeyahu, and let no one know where you are.”

<sup>20</sup> And they went to the sovereign, into the court. But they put the scroll in the room of Elishama the scribe, and told all the words in the hearing of the sovereign.

<sup>21</sup> The sovereign therefore sent Yehuḏi to bring the scroll, and he took it from the room of Elishama the scribe. And Yehuḏi read it in the hearing of the sovereign and in the hearing of all the heads standing beside the sovereign.

<sup>22</sup> And the sovereign was sitting in the winter house in the ninth month, with a fire burning on the hearth before him.

<sup>23</sup> Then it came to be, when Yehuḏi had read three or four columns, that the sovereign cut it with the scribe’s knife and threw it into the fire that was on the hearth, until the entire scroll was burned in the fire that was on the hearth.

<sup>24</sup> Yet the sovereign and all his servants who heard all these words were not afraid, nor did they tear their garments.

<sup>25</sup> Moreover, Elnathan, and Delayahu, and Gemaryahu pleaded with the sovereign not to burn the scroll, but he did not listen to them.

<sup>26</sup> And the sovereign commanded Yeraḥme’ĕl son of the sovereign, and Serayahu son of Azri’ĕl, and Shelemyahu son of Aḇde’ĕl, to seize Baruḵ the scribe and Yirmeyahu the prophet, but יהוה had hid them.

<sup>27</sup> And after the sovereign had burned the scroll with the words which Baruḵ had written from the mouth of Yirmeyahu, the word of יהוה came to Yirmeyahu, saying,

<sup>28</sup> “Take another scroll, and write on it all the former words that were in the first scroll which Yehoyaqim the sovereign of Yehuḏah has burned,

<sup>29</sup> and say to Yehoyaqim sovereign of Yehuḏah, ‘Thus said יהוה, “You have burned this scroll, saying, ‘Why have you written in it that the sovereign of Baḇel is certainly coming to destroy this land, and cause man and beast to cease from here?’ ”

<sup>30</sup> ‘Therefore thus said יהוה concerning Yehoyaqim sovereign of Yehuḏah, “He shall have no one to sit on the throne of Dawiḏ, and his dead body is to be thrown out, to the heat of the day and the frost of the night.

<sup>31</sup> “And I shall punish him, and his seed, and his servants for their crookedness. And I shall bring on them, and on the inhabitants of Yerushalayim, and on the men of Yehuḏah all the evil I have spoken against them. But they did not listen.” ’ ”

<sup>32</sup> So Yirmeyahu took another scroll and gave it to Baruḵ the scribe, son of Nĕriyahu, who wrote on it from the mouth of Yirmeyahu all the words of the book which Yehoyaqim sovereign of Yehuḏah had burned in the fire. And many similar words were added to them.
