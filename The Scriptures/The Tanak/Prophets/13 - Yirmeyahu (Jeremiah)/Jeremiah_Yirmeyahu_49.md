<sup>1</sup> Concerning the Ammonites: Thus said יהוה, “Has Yisra’ĕl no sons? Has he no heir? Why has Malkam taken possession of Gaḏ, and his people dwell in its cities?

<sup>2</sup> “Therefore see, the days are coming,” declares יהוה, “when I shall sound a battle cry in Rabbah of the Ammonites. And it shall be a heap, a wasteland, and her villages shall be burned with fire. Then Yisra’ĕl shall dispossess those who dispossessed him,” declares יהוה.

<sup>3</sup> “Howl, O Ḥeshbon, for Ai is ravaged! Cry, daughters of Rabbah, gird on sackcloth! Lament and diligently search by the walls, for Malkam shall go into exile, with his priests and his heads.

<sup>4</sup> “Why do you boast in the valleys, your flowing valley, O backsliding daughter who is trusting in her treasures, saying, ‘Who would come against me?’

<sup>5</sup> “See, I am bringing fear upon you, from all those around you,” declares the Master יהוה of hosts. “And you shall be driven out, each one straight ahead, with no one to bring home the wanderer.

<sup>6</sup> “And after this I turn back the captivity of the children of Ammon,” declares יהוה.

<sup>7</sup> Concerning Eḏom: Thus said יהוה of hosts, “Is there no more wisdom in Tĕman? Has counsel been lost to those with understanding? Has their wisdom vanished?

<sup>8</sup> “Flee, turn back, dwell in the depths, O inhabitants of Deḏan! For I shall bring the calamity of Ĕsaw upon him, the time that I shall punish him.

<sup>9</sup> “If grape-gatherers came to you, would they not leave some gleaning grapes? Even thieves by night would destroy only until they had enough!

<sup>10</sup> “But as for Me, I shall make Ĕsaw bare. I shall uncover his hiding places, so that he is unable to conceal himself. His seeds is ravaged, his brothers and his neighbours, and he is no more.

<sup>11</sup> “Leave your fatherless children, let Me keep them alive. And let your widows trust in Me.”

<sup>12</sup> For thus said יהוה, “See, those whose judgment was not to drink of the cup have certainly drunk. And are you the one to go unpunished? You shall not go unpunished, but certainly drink of it.

<sup>13</sup> “For I have sworn by Myself,” declares יהוה, “that Botsrah is to become a ruin, a reproach, a waste, and a curse, and all its cities become everlasting wastes.”

<sup>14</sup> I have heard a report from יהוה, and an envoy has been sent to the nations, “Gather together, come against her, and rise up to battle!

<sup>15</sup> “For look, I shall make you small among nations, despised among men.

<sup>16</sup> “The dread for you, the pride of your heart, has deceived you, O you who dwell in the clefts of the rock, holding the height of the hill! Though you make your nest as high as the eagle, from there I bring you down,” declares the Master.

<sup>17</sup> “And Eḏom shall be a ruin, everyone who passes by it is astonished and whistles at all its plagues.

<sup>18</sup> “As in the overthrow of Seḏom and Amorah and their neighbouring cities,” declares יהוה, “No one shall dwell there, nor would a son of man sojourn in it.

<sup>19</sup> “See, he comes up like a lion from the Yardĕn jungle against the home of the strong. But in an instant I shall make him run away from her. And who is the Chosen One, to appoint over her? For who is like Me? And who summons Me? And who is that Shepherd who stands before Me?”

<sup>20</sup> Therefore hear the counsel of יהוה which He has counselled concerning Eḏom, and the purposes He has purposed concerning the inhabitants of Tĕman: the least of the flock shall drag them away! He shall make their pasture a waste before them!

<sup>21</sup> The earth shall be shaken at the noise of their fall. There is an outcry! Its noise is heard at the Sea of Reeds.

<sup>22</sup> See, like an eagle he flies up, and spreads his wings over Botsrah. And the heart of the mighty men of Eḏom in that day shall be like the heart of a woman in her pain.

<sup>23</sup> Concerning Damascus: “Ḥamath and Arpaḏ have been put to shame, for they have heard an evil report. They have been melted in anxiety, like the sea, unable to rest.

<sup>24</sup> “Damascus has become feeble, she has turned to flee, and trembling has seized her. Distress and pain have taken hold of her like a woman in labour.

<sup>25</sup> “How is the city of praise deserted, the city of My joy!

<sup>26</sup> “Therefore her young men fall in her streets, and all the men of battle are cut off in that day,” declares יהוה of hosts.

<sup>27</sup> “And I shall kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall consume the palaces of Ben-Haḏaḏ.”

<sup>28</sup> To Qĕḏar and to the reigns of Ḥatsor, which Neḇuḵaḏretstsar sovereign of Baḇel smote: Thus said יהוה, “Arise, go up to Qĕḏar, and ravage the men of the East!

<sup>29</sup> “Their tents and their flocks, their curtains and all their vessels shall be taken. And they shall take away their camels for themselves. And they shall cry out to them, ‘Fear is on every side!’

<sup>30</sup> “Flee, go away! Dwell in the depths, O inhabitants of Ḥatsor!” declares יהוה. “For Neḇuḵaḏretstsar sovereign of Baḇel has taken counsel against you, and has devised a plan against you.

<sup>31</sup> “Arise, go up to the nation at ease that dwells safely,” declares יהוה. “It has no gates or bars, they dwell alone.

<sup>32</sup> “And their camels shall become plunder, and their large herds booty. And I shall scatter them to all winds, those who cut off the corner, and bring their calamity from all its sides,” declares יהוה.

<sup>33</sup> “Ḥatsor shall be a habitation for jackals, a desert forever. No one dwells there, nor does son of man sojourn in it.”

<sup>34</sup> The word of יהוה that came to Yirmeyahu the prophet concerning Ĕylam, in the beginning of the reign of Tsiḏqiyah, the sovereign of Yehuḏah, saying,

<sup>35</sup> “Thus said יהוה of hosts, ‘See, I am breaking the bow of Ĕylam, the chief of their might.

<sup>36</sup> ‘And I shall bring upon Ĕylam the four winds from the four quarters of the heavens, and scatter them toward all those winds. And there shall be no nation where the outcasts of Ĕylam do not go.

<sup>37</sup> ‘And I shall break Ĕylam before their enemies and before those who seek their life. And I shall bring evil upon them, my burning displeasure,’ declares יהוה. ‘And I shall send the sword after them until I have consumed them.

<sup>38</sup> ‘And I shall set My throne in Ĕylam, and destroy from there the sovereign and the heads,’ declares יהוה.

<sup>39</sup> ‘And it shall be in the latter days that I turn back the captivity of Ĕylam,’ declares יהוה.”
