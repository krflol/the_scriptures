<sup>1</sup> The word that came to Yirmeyahu from יהוה in the tenth year of Tsiḏqiyahu sovereign of Yehuḏah, which was the eighteenth year of Neḇuḵaḏretstsar.

<sup>2</sup> Now at that time the army of the sovereign of Baḇel besieged Yerushalayim, and Yirmeyahu the prophet was shut up in the court of the guard, which was in the house of the sovereign of Yehuḏah.

<sup>3</sup> For Tsiḏqiyahu sovereign of Yehuḏah had shut him up, saying, “Why are you prophesying, saying, ‘Thus said יהוה, “See, I am giving this city into the hand of the sovereign of Baḇel, and he shall take it,

<sup>4</sup> and Tsiḏqiyahu sovereign of Yehuḏah shall not escape from the hand of the Chaldeans, but certainly be given into the hand of the sovereign of Baḇel, and shall speak with him face to face, and see him eye to eye,

<sup>5</sup> and he shall lead Tsiḏqiyahu to Baḇel, and be there until I visit him,” declares יהוה, “though you fight with the Chaldeans, you shall not prosper” ’?”

<sup>6</sup> And Yirmeyahu said, “The word of יהוה came to me, saying,

<sup>7</sup> ‘See, Ḥaname’ĕl son of Shallum your uncle is coming to you, saying, “Buy my field which is in Anathoth, for the right of redemption is yours to buy it.” ’

<sup>8</sup> “So Ḥaname’ĕl my uncle’s son came to me in the court of the guard according to the word of יהוה, and said to me, ‘Please buy my field that is in Anathoth, which is in the land of Binyamin, for the right of inheritance is yours, and the redemption. Buy it for yourself.’ And I knew that this was the word of יהוה.

<sup>9</sup> “And I bought the field which was at Anathoth from Ḥaname’ĕl, my uncle’s son, and weighed out to him the silver, seventeen sheqels of silver.

<sup>10</sup> “And I signed the deed and sealed it, took witnesses, and weighed the silver in the scales.

<sup>11</sup> “Then I took the deed of purchase – that which was sealed according to the command and law, and that which was open –

<sup>12</sup> and I gave the deed of purchase to Baruḵ son of Nĕriyah, son of Maḥsĕyah, in the presence of Ḥaname’ĕl my uncle’s son, and in the presence of the witnesses who signed the deed of purchase, before all the Yehuḏim who sat in the court of the guard.

<sup>13</sup> “And I commanded Baruḵ before their eyes, saying,

<sup>14</sup> ‘Thus said יהוה of hosts, the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, “Take these deeds, both this deed of purchase which is sealed and this deed which is open, and put them in an earthen vessel, so that they remain many days.”

<sup>15</sup> ‘For thus said יהוה of hosts, the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, “Houses and fields and vineyards shall again be bought in this land.” ’

<sup>16</sup> “And after I had given the deed of purchase to Baruḵ son of Nĕriyah, I prayed to יהוה, saying,

<sup>17</sup> ‘Ah, Master יהוה ! See, You have made the heavens and the earth by Your great power and outstretched arm. There is no matter too hard for You,

<sup>18</sup> who show kindness to thousands, and repay the crookedness of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them – the Great, the Mighty Ĕl, יהוה of hosts is His Name,

<sup>19</sup> great in counsel and mighty in work, for Your eyes are open to all the ways of the sons of men, to give everyone according to his ways and according to the fruit of his deeds.

<sup>20</sup> ‘For You have set signs and wonders in the land of Mitsrayim, to this day, and in Yisra’ĕl and among other men. And You have made Yourself a Name, as it is this day.

<sup>21</sup> ‘And You have brought Your people Yisra’ĕl out of the land of Mitsrayim with signs and wonders, with a strong hand and an outstretched arm, and with great fearsome deeds.

<sup>22</sup> ‘And You gave them this land, of which You swore to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey.

<sup>23</sup> ‘And they came in and possessed it, but they did not obey Your voice nor did they walk in Your Torah. They did not do all that You commanded them to do, so You brought all this evil upon them.

<sup>24</sup> ‘See the siege mounds! They have come to the city to take it. And the city has been given into the hand of the Chaldeans who fight against it, because of the sword and the scarcity of food and the pestilence. And what You have spoken has come about, and look, You see it!

<sup>25</sup> ‘Yet You, O Master יהוה, have said to me, “Buy the field for silver, and take witnesses”! although the city has been given into the hand of the Chaldeans.’ ”

<sup>26</sup> Then the word of יהוה came to Yirmeyahu, saying,

<sup>27</sup> “See, I am יהוה, the Elohim of all flesh. Is there any matter too hard for Me?”

<sup>28</sup> Therefore thus said יהוה, “See, I am giving this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, into the hand of Neḇuḵaḏretstsar sovereign of Baḇel, and he shall take it.

<sup>29</sup> “And the Chaldeans who fight against this city shall come and set fire to this city and burn it, with the houses on whose roofs they burned incense to Ba‛al and poured out drink offerings to other mighty ones, to provoke Me.

<sup>30</sup> “For the children of Yisra’ĕl and the children of Yehuḏah have done only evil before Me, from their youth. For the children of Yisra’ĕl have only provoked Me with the work of their hands,” declares יהוה.

<sup>31</sup> “For this city has been a cause for My displeasure and My wrath from the day that they built it, even to this day that I should remove it from before My face,

<sup>32</sup> because of all the evil of the children of Yisra’ĕl and the children of Yehuḏah, which they have done to provoke Me – they, their sovereigns, their heads, their priests, their prophets, and the men of Yehuḏah, and the inhabitants of Yerushalayim.

<sup>33</sup> “And they have turned their back to Me, and not their face – though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, they did not listen to receive instruction.

<sup>34</sup> “And they set their abominations in the house which is called by My Name, to defile it.

<sup>35</sup> “And they built the high places of Ba‛al which are in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, to offer up their sons and their daughters to Moleḵ, which I did not command them, nor did it come into My heart, that they should do this abomination, to make Yehuḏah sin.

<sup>36</sup> “And now, thus said יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, concerning this city of which you say, ‘It shall be given into the hand of the sovereign of Baḇel by the sword, and by scarcity of food, and by pestilence’:

<sup>37</sup> ‘See, I am gathering them out of all the lands where I have driven them in My displeasure, and in My wrath, and in great rage. And I shall bring them back to this place, and shall let them dwell in safety.

<sup>38</sup> ‘And they shall be My people, and I shall be their Elohim.

<sup>39</sup> ‘And I shall give them one heart and one way, to fear Me all the days, for the good of them and of their children after them.

<sup>40</sup> ‘And I shall make an everlasting covenant with them, that I do not turn back from doing good to them. And I shall put My fear in their hearts so as not to turn aside from Me.

<sup>41</sup> ‘And I shall rejoice over them to do good to them, and shall plant them in this land in truth, with all My heart and with all My being.’

<sup>42</sup> “For thus said יהוה, ‘As I have brought all this great evil on this people, so I am bringing on them all the good that I am speaking to them.

<sup>43</sup> ‘And fields shall be bought in this land of which you are saying, “It is a wasteland, without man or beast. It has been given into the hand of the Chaldeans.”

<sup>44</sup> ‘Fields shall be bought for silver, and deeds signed and sealed, and witnesses be called, in the land of Binyamin, and in the places around Yerushalayim, and in the cities of Yehuḏah, and in the cities of the mountains, and in the cities of the low country, and in the cities of the South. For I shall turn back their captivity,’ declares יהוה.”

<sup>1</sup> The word that came to Yirmeyahu from יהוה in the tenth year of Tsiḏqiyahu sovereign of Yehuḏah, which was the eighteenth year of Neḇuḵaḏretstsar.

<sup>2</sup> Now at that time the army of the sovereign of Baḇel besieged Yerushalayim, and Yirmeyahu the prophet was shut up in the court of the guard, which was in the house of the sovereign of Yehuḏah.

<sup>3</sup> For Tsiḏqiyahu sovereign of Yehuḏah had shut him up, saying, “Why are you prophesying, saying, ‘Thus said יהוה, “See, I am giving this city into the hand of the sovereign of Baḇel, and he shall take it,

<sup>4</sup> and Tsiḏqiyahu sovereign of Yehuḏah shall not escape from the hand of the Chaldeans, but certainly be given into the hand of the sovereign of Baḇel, and shall speak with him face to face, and see him eye to eye,

<sup>5</sup> and he shall lead Tsiḏqiyahu to Baḇel, and be there until I visit him,” declares יהוה, “though you fight with the Chaldeans, you shall not prosper” ’?”

<sup>6</sup> And Yirmeyahu said, “The word of יהוה came to me, saying,

<sup>7</sup> ‘See, Ḥaname’ĕl son of Shallum your uncle is coming to you, saying, “Buy my field which is in Anathoth, for the right of redemption is yours to buy it.” ’

<sup>8</sup> “So Ḥaname’ĕl my uncle’s son came to me in the court of the guard according to the word of יהוה, and said to me, ‘Please buy my field that is in Anathoth, which is in the land of Binyamin, for the right of inheritance is yours, and the redemption.

<sup>13</sup> “And I commanded Baruḵ before their eyes, saying,

<sup>28</sup> Therefore thus said יהוה, “See, I am giving this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, into the hand of Neḇuḵaḏretstsar sovereign of Baḇel, and he shall take it.
