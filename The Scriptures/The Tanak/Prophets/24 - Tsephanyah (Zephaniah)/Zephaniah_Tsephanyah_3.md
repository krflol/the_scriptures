<sup>1</sup> Woe to her who is rebellious and defiled, the oppressing city!

<sup>2</sup> She did not obey the voice, she did not accept instruction, she did not trust in יהוה, she did not draw near to her Elohim.

<sup>3</sup> Her rulers in her midst are roaring lions, her judges are evening wolves, they shall leave no bone until morning.

<sup>4</sup> Her prophets are reckless, treacherous men. Her priests have profaned the set-apart place, they have done violence to the Torah.

<sup>5</sup> יהוה is righteous in her midst, He does no unrighteousness. Morning by morning He brings His right-ruling to light, it has not been lacking, yet the unrighteous one knows no shame.

<sup>6</sup> “I have cut off nations, their corner towers are in ruins. I have made their streets deserted, with no one passing by. Their cities are destroyed, without man, without inhabitant.

<sup>7</sup> “I have said, ‘Only fear Me, accept instruction.’ And her dwelling would not be cut off, all that I have appointed for her. But they rose up early, they corrupted all their deeds.

<sup>8</sup> “Therefore wait for Me,” declares יהוה, “until the day I rise up for plunder. For My judgment is to gather nations, to assemble reigns, to pour out on them My rage, all my burning wrath. For by the fire of My jealousy all the earth shall be consumed.

<sup>9</sup> “For then I shall turn unto the peoples a clean lip, so that they all call on the Name of יהוה, to serve Him with one shoulder.

<sup>10</sup> “From beyond the rivers of Kush my worshippers, the daughter of My dispersed ones, shall bring My offering.

<sup>11</sup> “In that day you shall not be put to shame for any of your deeds in which you have transgressed against Me, for then I shall remove from your midst your proud exulting ones, and you shall no more be haughty in My set-apart mountain.

<sup>12</sup> “But I shall leave in your midst an oppressed and poor people, and they shall trust in the Name of יהוה.

<sup>13</sup> “The remnant of Yisra’ĕl shall do no unrighteousness and speak no falsehood, nor is a tongue of deceit found in their mouth. For they shall feed their flocks and lie down, with none to frighten them.”

<sup>14</sup> Shout for joy, O daughter of Tsiyon! Shout, O Yisra’ĕl! Be glad and rejoice with all your heart, O daughter of Yerushalayim!

<sup>15</sup> יהוה has turned aside your judgments. He has faced your enemy. The Sovereign of Yisra’ĕl, יהוה, is in your midst. No longer need you fear evil.

<sup>16</sup> In that day it shall be said to Yerushalayim, “Do not fear, Tsiyon, do not let your hands be weak.

<sup>17</sup> “ יהוה your Elohim in your midst, is mighty to save. He rejoices over you with joy, He is silent in His love, He rejoices over you with singing.”

<sup>18</sup> “I shall gather those who grieve about the appointed place, who are among you, to whom its reproach is a burden.

<sup>19</sup> “See, I am dealing with all those afflicting you at that time. And I shall save the lame, and gather those who were cast out. And I shall give them for a praise and for a name in all the earth where they were put to shame.

<sup>20</sup> “At that time I shall bring you in, even at the time I gather you, for I shall give you for a name, and for a praise, among all the peoples of the earth, when I turn back your captivity before your eyes,” said יהוה.
