<sup>1</sup> And I lifted up my eyes again, and looked and saw four chariots coming from between two mountains, and the mountains were mountains of bronze.

<sup>2</sup> With the first chariot were red horses, and with the second chariot black horses,

<sup>3</sup> and with the third chariot white horses, and with the fourth chariot strong speckled horses.

<sup>4</sup> So I responded and said to the messenger who was speaking to me, “What are these, my master?”

<sup>5</sup> And the messenger answered and said to me, “These are four spirits of the heavens, coming forth from presenting themselves before the Master of all the earth.

<sup>6</sup> “The one with the black horses is going out to the land of the north, and the white ones have gone out after them, and the speckled ones have gone out to the land of the south.”

<sup>7</sup> And the strong ones went out, eager to go, to walk to and fro in the earth. And He said, “Go, walk to and fro in the earth.” So they walked to and fro in the earth.

<sup>8</sup> And He called to me, and spoke to me, saying, “See, those who go toward the land of the north have given rest to My Spirit in the land of the north.”

<sup>9</sup> And the word of יהוה came to me, saying,

<sup>10</sup> “Receive the gift from the exiles, from Ḥeldai, Toḇiyah, and Yeḏayah, who have come from Baḇel. Then you shall go the same day and enter the house of Yoshiyah son of Tsephanyah.

<sup>11</sup> “And you shall take the silver and gold, make a crown, and set it on the head of Yehoshua the son of Yehotsaḏaq, the high priest,

<sup>12</sup> and shall speak to him, saying, ‘Thus said יהוה of hosts, saying, “See, the Man whose name is the Branch! And from His place He shall branch out, and He shall build the Hĕḵal of יהוה.

<sup>13</sup> “It is He who is going to build the Hĕḵal of יהוה. It is He who is going to bear the splendour. And He shall sit and rule on His throne, and shall be a priest on His throne, and the counsel of peace shall be between Them both,” ’

<sup>14</sup> while the crown is for a remembrance in the Hĕḵal of יהוה to Ḥĕlem, and to Toḇiyah, and to Yeḏayah, and to Ḥĕn son of Tsephanyah.

<sup>15</sup> “And those who are far away shall come and build the Hĕḵal of יהוה. And you shall know that יהוה of hosts has sent Me to you. And this shall be, if you diligently obey the voice of יהוה your Elohim.”
