<sup>5</sup> “And they shall be like mighty men, who trample down the mud of the streets in the battle. And they shall fight because יהוה is with them, and the riders on horses shall be put to shame.

<sup>6</sup> “And I shall make the house of Yehuḏah mighty, and save the house of Yosĕph. And I shall bring them back, because I have compassion on them. And they shall be as though I had not pushed them aside. For I am יהוה their Elohim, and I answer them.

<sup>7</sup> “And Ephrayim shall be as a mighty man, and their heart shall rejoice as if with wine. And their children shall see and rejoice, their heart exulting in יהוה.

<sup>8</sup> “I shall whistle for them and gather them, for I shall ransom them. And they shall increase as they once increased.

<sup>9</sup> “Though I sow them among peoples, they shall remember Me in places far away. And they shall live, together with their children, and they shall return.

<sup>10</sup> “And I shall bring them back from the land of Mitsrayim, and gather them from Ashshur, and bring them into the land of Gil‛aḏ and Leḇanon, until no more room is found for them.
