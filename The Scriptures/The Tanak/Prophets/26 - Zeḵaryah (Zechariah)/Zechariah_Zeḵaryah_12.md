<sup>1</sup> The message of the word of יהוה against Yisra’ĕl. יהוה, stretching out the heavens, and laying the foundation of the earth, and forming the spirit of man within him, declares,

<sup>2</sup> “See, I am making Yerushalayim a cup of reeling to all the people all around, and also against Yehuḏah it is in the siege against Yerushalayim.

<sup>3</sup> “And in that day it shall be that I make Yerushalayim a very heavy stone for all peoples – all lifting it are severely injured. And all the nations of the earth shall be gathered against it.

<sup>4</sup> “In that day,” declares יהוה, “I smite every horse with bewilderment and its rider with madness. And on the house of Yehuḏah I open My eyes, but every horse of the peoples I smite with blindness.

<sup>5</sup> “And the leaders of Yehuḏah shall say in their heart, ‘The inhabitants of Yerushalayim are a strength to me, through יהוה of hosts, their Elohim.’

<sup>6</sup> “In that day I make the leaders of Yehuḏah like a fire pot among trees, and like a torch of fire in the sheaves. And they shall consume all the peoples all around, on the right and on the left. And Yerushalayim shall dwell again in her own place, in Yerushalayim.

<sup>7</sup> “And יהוה shall save the tents of Yehuḏah first, so that the comeliness of the house of Dawiḏ and the comeliness of the inhabitants of Yerushalayim would not become greater than that of Yehuḏah.

<sup>8</sup> “In that day יהוה shall shield the inhabitants of Yerushalayim. And the feeble among them in that day shall be like Dawiḏ, and the house of Dawiḏ like Elohim, like the Messenger of יהוה before them!

<sup>9</sup> “And it shall be in that day that I seek to destroy all the gentiles that come against Yerushalayim.

<sup>10</sup> “And I shall pour on the house of Dawiḏ and on the inhabitants of Yerushalayim a spirit of favour and prayers. And they shall look on Me whom they pierced, and they shall mourn for Him as one mourns for his only son. And they shall be in bitterness over Him as a bitterness over the first-born.

<sup>11</sup> “In that day the mourning in Yerushalayim is going to be great, like the mourning at Haḏaḏ Rimmon in the valley of Meḡiddo.

<sup>12</sup> “And the land shall mourn, every clan by itself: the clan of the house of Dawiḏ by itself, and their women by themselves; the clan of the house of Nathan by itself, and their women by themselves;

<sup>13</sup> the clan of the house of Lĕwi by itself, and their women by themselves; the clan of Shim‛i by itself, and their women by themselves;

<sup>14</sup> all the rest of the clans, every clan by itself, and their women by themselves.
