<sup>1</sup> And the messenger who was speaking to me came back and woke me up as a man is awakened from sleep.

<sup>2</sup> And he said to me, “What do you see?” So I said, “I have looked, and see: a lampstand all of gold with a bowl on top of it, and on the stand seven lamps with seven spouts to the seven lamps.

<sup>3</sup> “And two olive trees are by it, one at the right of the bowl and the other at its left.”

<sup>4</sup> Then I responded and spoke to the messenger who was speaking to me, saying, “What are these, my master?”

<sup>5</sup> And the messenger who was speaking to me answered and said to me, “Do you not know what these are?” And I said, “No, my master.”

<sup>6</sup> And he answered and said to me, “This is the word of יהוה to Zerubbaḇel, ‘Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,’ said יהוה of hosts.

<sup>7</sup> ‘Who are you, great mountain, before Zerubbaḇel? A plain! And he shall bring forth the capstone with shouts of “Favour, favour to it!” ’ ”

<sup>8</sup> And the word of יהוה came to me, saying,

<sup>9</sup> “The hands of Zerubbaḇel have laid the foundation of this House, and his hands shall complete it. And you shall know that יהוה of hosts has sent Me to you.

<sup>10</sup> “For who has despised the day of small beginnings? They shall rejoice when they see the plumb-line in the hand of Zerubbaḇel. These seven are the eyes of יהוה, which diligently search throughout all the earth.”

<sup>11</sup> Then I responded and said to him, “What are these two olive trees, one at the right of the lampstand and the other at its left?”

<sup>12</sup> And I responded a second time and said to him, “What are these two olive branches which empty golden oil from themselves by means of the two gold pipes?”

<sup>13</sup> And he answered me and said, “Do you not know what these are?” And I said, “No, my master.”

<sup>14</sup> And he said, “These are the two anointed ones, who stand beside the Master of all the earth.”
