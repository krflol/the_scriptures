<sup>1</sup> And the word of יהוה of hosts came, saying,

<sup>2</sup> “Thus said יהוה of hosts, ‘I shall be jealous for Tsiyon with great jealousy, with great wrath I shall be jealous for her.’

<sup>3</sup> “Thus said יהוה, ‘I shall return to Tsiyon, and I shall dwell in the midst of Yerushalayim. And Yerushalayim shall be called: City of the Truth, and the Mountain of יהוה of hosts, the Set-apart Mountain.’

<sup>4</sup> “Thus said יהוה of hosts, ‘Again old men and old women shall dwell in the streets of Yerushalayim, each one with his staff in his hand because of great age,

<sup>5</sup> and the streets of the city shall be filled with boys and girls playing in its streets.’

<sup>6</sup> “Thus said יהוה of hosts, ‘If it is marvellous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in these days, should it also be marvellous in My eyes?’ declares יהוה of hosts.

<sup>7</sup> “Thus said יהוה of hosts, ‘See, I am saving My people from the land of the sunrise and from the land of the sunset.

<sup>8</sup> ‘And I shall bring them back, and they shall dwell in the midst of Yerushalayim. And they shall be My people, and I shall be their Elohim, in truth and in righteousness.’

<sup>9</sup> “Thus said יהוה of hosts, ‘Let your hands be strong, you who are listening in these days to these words, from the mouth of the prophets, of the day the foundation was laid for the House of יהוה of hosts, the Hĕḵal that was to be rebuilt.

<sup>10</sup> ‘For before these days there was not a wage for a man, nor a hire for beast, and there was no peace for him who went out or came in, because of his enemies, and I set all men one against another.

<sup>11</sup> ‘But now I am not as in the former days to the remnant of this people,’ declares יהוה of hosts.

<sup>12</sup> ‘Because of the sowing of peace the vine does give its fruit, the ground does give her increase, and the heavens do give their dew. And I shall cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these.

<sup>13</sup> ‘And it shall be, as you were a curse among the gentiles, O house of Yehuḏah and house of Yisra’ĕl, so I shall save you, and you shall be a blessing. Do not fear, let your hands be strong.’

<sup>14</sup> “For thus said יהוה of hosts, ‘As I purposed to do evil to you when your fathers provoked Me,’ declares יהוה of hosts, ‘and I did not relent,

<sup>15</sup> so again in these days I have purposed to do good to Yerushalayim and to the house of Yehuḏah. Do not fear!

<sup>16</sup> ‘These are the words you should do: speak the truth to one another, judge with truth and right-ruling for peace in your gates.

<sup>17</sup> ‘And do not plot evil in your heart against another, and do not love a false oath. For all these I hate,’ declares יהוה.”

<sup>18</sup> And the word of יהוה of hosts came to me, saying,

<sup>19</sup> “Thus said יהוה of hosts, ‘The fast of the fourth, and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth months, are to be joy and gladness, and pleasant appointed times for the house of Yehuḏah – and they shall love the truth and the peace.’

<sup>20</sup> “Thus said יהוה of hosts, ‘Peoples shall yet come, inhabitants of many cities,

<sup>21</sup> and the inhabitants of the one go to another, saying, “Let us earnestly go and pray before יהוה, and seek יהוה of hosts. I myself am going.”

<sup>22</sup> ‘And many peoples and strong nations shall come to seek יהוה of hosts in Yerushalayim, and to pray before יהוה.’

<sup>23</sup> “Thus said יהוה of hosts, ‘In those days ten men from all languages of the nations take hold, yea, they shall take hold of the edge of the garment of a man, a Yehuḏite, saying, “Let us go with you, for we have heard that Elohim is with you.” ’ ”
