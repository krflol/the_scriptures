<sup>1</sup> And I lifted up my eyes again, and looked and saw a flying scroll.

<sup>2</sup> And he said to me, “What do you see?” And I answered, “I see a flying scroll, twenty cubits long and ten cubits wide.”

<sup>3</sup> And he said to me, “This is the curse that goes forth over the face of all the earth: ‘everyone who is stealing shall go unpunished,’ on the one side, according to it, and, ‘everyone who has sworn falsely shall go unpunished,’ on the other side, according to it.”

<sup>4</sup> “I shall send it out,” declares יהוה of hosts, “and it shall come into the house of the thief and the house of the one who shall swear falsely by My Name. And it shall remain in the midst of his house and shall consume it, both its timber and stones.”

<sup>5</sup> And the messenger who was speaking with me came out and said to me, “Lift up your eyes now, and see what this is that is going forth.”

<sup>6</sup> And I said, “What is it?” And he said, “It is an ĕphah-measure that is going forth.” Again he said, “This is their appearance throughout the earth:

<sup>7</sup> “And see, a lead cover lifted up, and this: a woman sitting inside the ĕphah-measure!”

<sup>8</sup> And he said, “This is Wrongness!” And he threw her down into the ĕphah-measure, and threw the lead weight over its mouth.

<sup>9</sup> And I lifted up my eyes, and looked and saw two women, coming with the wind in their wings. And they had wings like the wings of a stork, and they lifted up the ĕphah-measure between earth and the heavens.

<sup>10</sup> Then I said to the messenger who was speaking to me, “Where are they taking the ĕphah-measure?”

<sup>11</sup> And he said to me, “To build a house for it in the land of Shin‛ar. And it shall be established and set there on its own base.”
