<sup>1</sup> Open your doors, O Leḇanon, and let fire devour your cedars.

<sup>2</sup> Howl, O cypress, for the cedar has fallen, because the mighty are ravaged. Howl, O oaks of Bashan, for the dense forest has come down.

<sup>3</sup> Listen! The howling of shepherds, for their splendour is ravaged. Listen! The roaring of lions, for the pride of the Yardĕn is ravaged.

<sup>4</sup> Thus said יהוה my Elohim, “Feed the flock for slaughter,

<sup>5</sup> whose owners slaughter them and feel no guilt, and their sellers say, ‘Blessed be יהוה, for I have become rich.’ And their own shepherds do not spare them.

<sup>6</sup> “For I shall no longer spare the inhabitants of the land,” declares יהוה. “But see, I am delivering up mankind, each one into his neighbour’s hand and into the hand of his sovereign. And they shall crush the earth, but I do not deliver from their hand.”

<sup>7</sup> So I shepherded the flock meant for slaughter, the truly poor of the flock. And I took for myself two staffs, the one I called Pleasantness, and the other I called Unity, and I shepherded the flock.

<sup>8</sup> Then I sent off the three shepherds in one month, for my being despised them, and their being also loathed me.

<sup>9</sup> So I said, “I am not shepherding you. Let the dying die, and the straying stray, and let those who are left eat each other’s flesh.”

<sup>10</sup> And I took my staff, Pleasantness, and cut it in two, to break the covenant which I had made with all the peoples.

<sup>11</sup> So it was broken on that day. And the poor of the flock, who were watching me, knew that it was the word of יהוה.

<sup>12</sup> And I said to them, “If it is good in your eyes, give me my wages. And if not, refrain.” So they weighed out for my wages thirty pieces of silver.

<sup>13</sup> And יהוה said to me, “Throw it to the potter,” the splendid price at which I was valued by them. And I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them into the House of יהוה for the potter.

<sup>14</sup> Then I cut in two my other staff, Unity, to break the brotherhood between Yehuḏah and Yisra’ĕl.

<sup>15</sup> And יהוה said to me, “Take again the implements of a foolish shepherd.

<sup>16</sup> “For look, I am raising up a shepherd in the land who does not visit those straying, nor seek the young, nor heal those that are broken, nor feed those that still stand. But he does eat the flesh of the fat and tear off their hooves.

<sup>17</sup> “Woe to the worthless shepherd forsaking the flock! Let a sword be upon his arm and upon his right eye! His arm shall wither and his right eye shall be dimmed.”
