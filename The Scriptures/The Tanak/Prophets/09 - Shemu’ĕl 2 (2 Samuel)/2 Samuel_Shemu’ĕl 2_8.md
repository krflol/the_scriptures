<sup>1</sup> And after this it came to be that Dawiḏ smote the Philistines and humbled them. And Dawiḏ took the bridle of the mother city out of the hand of the Philistines.

<sup>2</sup> He also smote Mo’aḇ, and measured them off with a line, causing them to lie down on the earth. With two lines he measured off those to be put to death, and with one complete line those to be kept alive. And the Mo’aḇites became Dawiḏ’s servants, and brought presents.

<sup>3</sup> Dawiḏ also smote Haḏaḏezer son of Reḥoḇ, sovereign of Tsoḇah, as he went to restore his rule at the River Euphrates.

<sup>4</sup> And Dawiḏ captured from him one thousand and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand foot soldiers. And Dawiḏ destroyed all the chariots, but he left of them a hundred chariots.

<sup>5</sup> And the Arameans of Damascus came to help Haḏaḏezer sovereign of Tsoḇah, and Dawiḏ smote twenty-two thousand of the Arameans.

<sup>6</sup> Then Dawiḏ put watch-posts in Aram of Damascus. And the Arameans became Dawiḏ’s servants, and brought presents. And יהוה saved Dawiḏ wherever he went.

<sup>7</sup> And Dawiḏ took the shields of gold which were on the servants of Haḏaḏezer, and brought them to Yerushalayim.

<sup>8</sup> And from Betaḥ and from Bĕrothai, cities of Haḏaḏezer, Sovereign Dawiḏ took very much bronze.

<sup>9</sup> And To‛i sovereign of Ḥamath heard that Dawiḏ had smitten all the army of Haḏaḏezer,

<sup>10</sup> so To‛i sent Yoram his son to Sovereign Dawiḏ, to ask peace of him and bless him, because he had fought against Haḏaḏezer and smote him, for Haḏaḏezer had battles with To‛i. And Yoram brought with him objects of silver, and objects of gold, and objects of bronze.

<sup>11</sup> Sovereign Dawiḏ also set these apart to יהוה, along with the silver and gold that he had set apart from all the nations which he had humbled:

<sup>12</sup> from Aram, and from Mo’aḇ, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalĕq, and from the spoil of Haḏaḏezer son of Reḥoḇ, sovereign of Tsoḇah.

<sup>13</sup> And Dawiḏ made a name for himself when he returned from smiting eighteen thousand Arameans in the Valley of Salt.

<sup>14</sup> And he put watch-posts in Eḏom. Throughout all Eḏom he put watch-posts, and all the Eḏomites became Dawiḏ’s servants. And יהוה saved Dawiḏ wherever he went.

<sup>15</sup> And Dawiḏ reigned over all Yisra’ĕl, and Dawiḏ was doing right-ruling and righteousness to all his people.

<sup>16</sup> And Yo’aḇ son of Tseruyah was over the army, and Yehoshaphat son of Aḥiluḏ was recorder,

<sup>17</sup> and Tsaḏoq son of Aḥituḇ and Aḥimeleḵ son of Eḇyathar were the priests, and Serayah was the scribe,

<sup>18</sup> and Benayahu son of Yehoyaḏa was over both the Kerĕthites and the Pelĕthites, and Dawiḏ’s sons were priests.
