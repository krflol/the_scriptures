<sup>1</sup> And Dawiḏ had passed on a little from the summit, and saw Tsiḇa the servant of Mephiḇosheth, who met him with a couple of saddled donkeys, and on them two hundred loaves, and one hundred cakes of raisins, and one hundred summer fruit, and a skin of wine.

<sup>2</sup> And the sovereign said to Tsiḇa, “Why do you have these?” And Tsiḇa said, “The donkeys are for the sovereign’s household to ride on, and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat, and the wine for the wearied to drink in the wilderness.”

<sup>3</sup> And the sovereign said, “And where is the son of your master?” And Tsiḇa said to the sovereign, “See, he remains in Yerushalayim, for he said, ‘Today the house of Yisra’ĕl is going to return the reign of my father to me.’ ”

<sup>4</sup> And the sovereign said to Tsiḇa, “See, all that belongs to Mephiḇosheth is yours.” And Tsiḇa said, “I have bowed myself, let me find favour in your eyes, my master, O sovereign!”

<sup>5</sup> And when Sovereign Dawiḏ came to Baḥurim he saw a man from the clan of the house of Sha’ul, whose name was Shim‛i son of Gĕra, coming from there. He came out, cursing as he came.

<sup>6</sup> And he threw Dawiḏ with stones, and all the servants of Sovereign Dawiḏ. And all the people and all the mighty men were on his right and on his left.

<sup>7</sup> And this is what Shim‛i said as he cursed, “Get out! Get out! O man of blood, and man of Beliya‛al!

<sup>8</sup> “ יהוה has brought upon you all the blood of the house of Sha’ul, in whose place you have reigned. And יהוה has given the reign into the hand of Aḇshalom your son. And see, you are in your own evil, for you are a man of blood!”

<sup>9</sup> And Aḇishai son of Tseruyah said to the sovereign, “Why should this dead dog curse my master the sovereign? Please, let me pass over and take off his head!”

<sup>10</sup> And the sovereign said, “What have I to do with you, you sons of Tseruyah? For let him curse, even because יהוה has said to him, ‘Curse Dawiḏ.’ And who should say, ‘Why did you do that?’ ”

<sup>11</sup> And Dawiḏ said to Aḇishai and all his servants, “See how my son who came from my own body seeks my life, and how much more now this Binyamite? Leave him alone, and let him curse, for יהוה has spoken to him.

<sup>12</sup> “If so be, יהוה does look on my affliction, and יהוה shall return good to me for his cursing today.”

<sup>13</sup> And as Dawiḏ and his men went in the way, Shim‛i walked alongside him on the hillside, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him and kicked up dust.

<sup>14</sup> And the sovereign and all the people who were with him became weary, and they refreshed themselves there.

<sup>15</sup> And Aḇshalom and all the people, the men of Yisra’ĕl, came to Yerushalayim, and Aḥithophel was with him.

<sup>16</sup> And it came to be, when Ḥushai the Arkite, the friend of Dawiḏ, had come to Aḇshalom, that Ḥushai said to Aḇshalom, “Let the sovereign live! Let the sovereign live!”

<sup>17</sup> And Aḇshalom said to Ḥushai, “Is this your kindness to your friend? Why did you not go with your friend?”

<sup>18</sup> And Ḥushai said to Aḇshalom, “No, I am for the one whom יהוה and this people and all the men of Yisra’ĕl have chosen, and with him I remain.

<sup>19</sup> “And besides, whom should I serve? Should it not be before his son? As I have served before your father, so I am before you.”

<sup>20</sup> And Aḇshalom said to Aḥithophel, “Give your advice. What should we do?”

<sup>21</sup> And Aḥithophel said to Aḇshalom, “Go in to your father’s concubines, whom he has left to look after the house. And all Yisra’ĕl shall hear that you have made yourself a stench to your father. And the hands of all who are with you shall be strong.”

<sup>22</sup> So they pitched a tent for Aḇshalom on the top of the house, and Aḇshalom went in to his father’s concubines before the eyes of all Yisra’ĕl.

<sup>23</sup> Now the advice Aḥithophel gave in those days was as if one had inquired at the word of Elohim. So was all the advice of Aḥithophel both to Dawiḏ and to Aḇshalom.
