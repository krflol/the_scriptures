<sup>1</sup> And it came to be when the sovereign was dwelling in his house, and יהוה had given him rest from all his enemies all around,

<sup>2</sup> that the sovereign said to Nathan the prophet, “See now, I am dwelling in a house of cedar, but the ark of Elohim dwells within curtains.”

<sup>3</sup> And Nathan said to the sovereign, “Go, do all that is in your heart, for יהוה is with you.”

<sup>4</sup> And it came to be that night that the word of יהוה came to Nathan, saying,

<sup>5</sup> “Go and say to My servant Dawiḏ, ‘Thus said יהוה, “Would you build a house for Me to dwell in?

<sup>6</sup> “For I have not dwelt in a house since the time that I brought the children of Yisra’ĕl up from Mitsrayim, even to this day, but have moved about in a Tent and in a Dwelling Place.

<sup>7</sup> “Wherever I have walked with all the children of Yisra’ĕl, have I ever spoken a word to anyone from the tribes of Yisra’ĕl, whom I commanded to shepherd My people Yisra’ĕl, saying, ‘Why have you not built Me a house of cedar?’ ” ’

<sup>8</sup> “And now, say to My servant Dawiḏ, ‘Thus said יהוה of hosts, “I took you from the pasture, from following the flock, to be ruler over My people, over Yisra’ĕl.

<sup>9</sup> “And I have been with you wherever you have gone, and have cut off all your enemies from before you, and have made you a great name, like the name of the great ones who are on the earth.

<sup>10</sup> “And I shall appoint a place for My people Yisra’ĕl, and shall plant them, and they shall dwell in a place of their own and no longer be afraid, neither shall the children of wickedness oppress them again, as at the first,

<sup>11</sup> even from the day I appointed rulers over My people Yisra’ĕl, and have caused you to rest from all your enemies. And יהוה has declared to you that He would make you a house.

<sup>12</sup> “When your days are filled and you rest with your fathers, I shall raise up your seed after you, who comes from your inward parts, and shall establish his reign.

<sup>13</sup> “He does build a house for My Name, and I shall establish the throne of his reign forever.

<sup>14</sup> “I am to be his Father, and he is My son. If he does perversely, I shall reprove him with the rod of men and with the blows of the sons of men.

<sup>15</sup> “But My kindness does not turn aside from him, as I turned it aside from Sha’ul, whom I removed from before you.

<sup>16</sup> “And your house and your reign are to be steadfast forever before you – your throne is established forever.” ’ ”

<sup>17</sup> According to all these words and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to Dawiḏ.

<sup>18</sup> And Sovereign Dawiḏ went in and sat before יהוה and he said, “Who am I, O Master יהוה ? And what is my house, that You have brought me this far?

<sup>19</sup> “And yet this was a small matter in Your eyes, O Master יהוה. And You have also spoken of Your servant’s house for a great while to come. And is this the teaching of man, O Master יהוה ?

<sup>20</sup> “And what more does Dawiḏ say to You? For You, Master יהוה, know Your servant.

<sup>21</sup> “Because of Your word, and according to Your own heart, You have done all this greatness, to make it known to Your servant.

<sup>22</sup> “You are great indeed, O Master יהוה. For there is none like You, and there is no Elohim but You, according to all that we have heard with our ears.

<sup>23</sup> “And who is like Your people, like Yisra’ĕl, the one nation on the earth whom Elohim went to redeem for Himself as a people, to make for Himself a Name, and to do for You greatness, and awesome deeds for Your land before Your people, whom You redeemed for Yourself from Mitsrayim, from the nations and their mighty ones?

<sup>24</sup> “And You have established for Yourself Your people Yisra’ĕl as Your own people forever, and You, יהוה, have become their Elohim.

<sup>25</sup> “And now, O יהוה Elohim, the word which You have spoken concerning Your servant and concerning his house, establish it forever and do as You have said.

<sup>26</sup> “And let Your Name be made great forever, saying, ‘ יהוה of hosts is the Elohim over Yisra’ĕl.’ And let the house of Your servant Dawiḏ be established before You.

<sup>27</sup> “For You, O יהוה of hosts, the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, have revealed this to Your servant, saying, ‘I build you a house.’ Therefore Your servant has taken heart to pray this prayer to You.

<sup>28</sup> “And now, O Master יהוה, You are Elohim, and Your words are true, and You have spoken this goodness to Your servant.

<sup>29</sup> “And now, be pleased to bless the house of Your servant, to be before You, forever. For You, O Master יהוה, have spoken it, and with Your blessing let the house of Your servant be blessed forever.”
