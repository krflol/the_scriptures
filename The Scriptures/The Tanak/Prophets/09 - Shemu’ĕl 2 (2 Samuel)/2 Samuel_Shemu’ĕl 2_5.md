<sup>1</sup> And all the tribes of Yisra’ĕl came to Dawiḏ at Ḥeḇron and spoke, saying, “Look, we are your bone and your flesh.

<sup>2</sup> “Formerly, when Sha’ul was sovereign over us, you were the one who led Yisra’ĕl out and brought them in. And יהוה said to you, ‘Shepherd My people Yisra’ĕl, and be ruler over Yisra’ĕl.’ ”

<sup>3</sup> And all the elders of Yisra’ĕl came to the sovereign at Ḥeḇron, and Sovereign Dawiḏ made a covenant with them at Ḥeḇron before יהוה. And they anointed Dawiḏ sovereign over Yisra’ĕl.

<sup>4</sup> Dawiḏ was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.

<sup>5</sup> In Ḥeḇron he reigned over Yehuḏah seven years and six months, and in Yerushalayim he reigned thirty-three years over all Yisra’ĕl and Yehuḏah.

<sup>6</sup> And the sovereign and his men went to Yerushalayim against the Yeḇusites, the inhabitants of the land. And they spoke to Dawiḏ, saying, “Except you take away the blind and the lame, you are not going to come in here,” thinking, “Dawiḏ is not going to come in here.”

<sup>7</sup> But Dawiḏ captured the stronghold of Tsiyon, the City of Dawiḏ.

<sup>8</sup> And Dawiḏ said on that day, “Anyone who smites the Yeḇusites, let him go by the water-shaft and take the lame and the blind, who are hated by Dawiḏ’s being.” That is why they say, “The blind and the lame do not come into the house.”

<sup>9</sup> And Dawiḏ dwelt in the stronghold, and called it the City of Dawiḏ. And Dawiḏ built all around from the Millo and inward.

<sup>10</sup> And Dawiḏ went on and became great, and יהוה Elohim of hosts was with him.

<sup>11</sup> Now Ḥiram sovereign of Tsor sent messengers to Dawiḏ, and cedar trees, and carpenters and masons. And they built a house for Dawiḏ.

<sup>12</sup> And Dawiḏ knew that יהוה had established him as sovereign over Yisra’ĕl, and that He had exalted His reign, because of His people Yisra’ĕl.

<sup>13</sup> And Dawiḏ took more concubines and wives from Yerushalayim, after he had come from Ḥeḇron, and more sons and daughters were born to Dawiḏ.

<sup>14</sup> And these were the names of those born to him in Yerushalayim: Shammua, and Shoḇaḇ, and Nathan, and Shelomoh,

<sup>15</sup> and Yiḇḥar, and Elishua, and Nepheḡ, and Yaphiya,

<sup>16</sup> and Elishama, and Elyaḏa, and Eliphelet.

<sup>17</sup> And the Philistines heard that they had anointed Dawiḏ sovereign over Yisra’ĕl, and all the Philistines went up to search for Dawiḏ, but Dawiḏ heard and went down to the stronghold.

<sup>18</sup> And the Philistines came and spread themselves out in the Valley of Repha’im.

<sup>19</sup> And Dawiḏ inquired of יהוה, saying, “Do I go up against the Philistines? Do You give them into my hand?” And יהוה said to Dawiḏ, “Go up, for I shall certainly give the Philistines into your hand.”

<sup>20</sup> And Dawiḏ came to Ba‛al Peratsim, and Dawiḏ smote them there. And he said, “ יהוה has broken through my enemies before me, like a breakthrough of water.” So he called the name of that place Ba‛al Peratsim.

<sup>21</sup> And they left their images there, and Dawiḏ and his men took them away.

<sup>22</sup> And the Philistines again came up and were spread out in the Valley of Repha’im.

<sup>23</sup> And when Dawiḏ inquired of יהוה, He said, “Do not go up, turn around behind them, and you shall come upon them in front of the mulberry trees.

<sup>24</sup> “And it shall be, when you hear the sound of stepping in the tops of the mulberry trees, then act promptly, for then יהוה shall go out before you to smite the camp of the Philistines.”

<sup>25</sup> And Dawiḏ did so, as יהוה commanded him, and smote the Philistines from Geḇa as far as Gezer.

<sup>1</sup> And all the tribes of Yisra’ĕl came to Dawiḏ at Ḥeḇron and spoke, saying, “Look, we are your bone and your flesh.

<sup>2</sup> “Formerly, when Sha’ul was sovereign over us, you were the one who led Yisra’ĕl out and brought them in. And יהוה said to you, ‘Shepherd My people Yisra’ĕl, and be ruler over Yisra’ĕl.’ ”

<sup>3</sup> And all the elders of Yisra’ĕl came to the sovereign at Ḥeḇron, and Sovereign Dawiḏ made a covenant with them at Ḥeḇron before יהוה. And they anointed Dawiḏ sovereign over Yisra’ĕl.

<sup>4</sup> Dawiḏ was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.

<sup>5</sup> In Ḥeḇron he reigned over Yehuḏah seven years and six months, and in Yerushalayim he reigned thirty-three years over all Yisra’ĕl and Yehuḏah.

<sup>25</sup> And Dawiḏ did so, as יהוה commanded him, and smote the Philistines from Geḇa as far as Gezer.
