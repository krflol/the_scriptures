<sup>1</sup> And Dawiḏ said, “Is there still anyone who is left of the house of Sha’ul, that I might show him kindness, because of Yehonathan?”

<sup>2</sup> And the house of Sha’ul had a servant whose name was Tsiḇa. And they had called him to Dawiḏ, and the sovereign said to him, “Are you Tsiḇa?” And he said, “Your servant!”

<sup>3</sup> And the sovereign said, “Is there not still someone of the house of Sha’ul, so that I show him the kindness of Elohim?” And Tsiḇa said to the sovereign, “There is still a son of Yehonathan, lame in his feet.”

<sup>4</sup> So the sovereign said to him, “Where is he?” And Tsiḇa said to the sovereign, “See, he is in the house of Maḵir son of Ammi’ĕl, in Lo Ḏeḇar.”

<sup>5</sup> And Sovereign Dawiḏ sent and brought him out of the house of Maḵir son of Ammi’ĕl, from Lo Ḏeḇar.

<sup>6</sup> And Mephiḇosheth son of Yehonathan, son of Sha’ul, came to Dawiḏ, and fell on his face and did obeisance. And Dawiḏ said, “Mephiḇosheth!” And he answered, “Here is your servant!”

<sup>7</sup> Dawiḏ then said to him, “Do not fear, for I shall certainly show you kindness because of Yehonathan your father, and shall return to you all the land of Sha’ul your grandfather, and let you eat bread at my table continually.”

<sup>8</sup> And he bowed himself and said, “What is your servant, that you should turn to such a dead dog as I?”

<sup>9</sup> And the sovereign called Tsiḇa servant of Sha’ul, and said to him, “I have given to your master’s son all that belonged to Sha’ul and to all his house.

<sup>10</sup> “And you and your sons and your servants, shall work the land for him, and you shall bring in its yield, and your master’s son shall have food to eat. But let Mephiḇosheth your master’s son eat bread at my table always.” And Tsiḇa had fifteen sons and twenty servants.

<sup>11</sup> And Tsiḇa said to the sovereign, “According to all that my master the sovereign has commanded his servant, so your servant does.” “As for Mephiḇosheth,” said the sovereign, “he shall eat at my table as one of the sons of the sovereign.”

<sup>12</sup> And Mephiḇosheth had a young son whose name was Miḵa. And all who dwelt in the house of Tsiḇa were servants of Mephiḇosheth.

<sup>13</sup> And Mephiḇosheth was dwelling in Yerushalayim, for he ate continually at the sovereign’s table. And he was lame in both his feet.
