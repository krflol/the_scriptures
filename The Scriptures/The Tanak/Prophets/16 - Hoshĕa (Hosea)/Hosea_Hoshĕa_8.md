<sup>1</sup> “Put the ram’s horn to your mouth, like an eagle against the House of יהוה, because they have transgressed My covenant, and they have rebelled against My Torah.

<sup>2</sup> “They cry out to Me, ‘My Elohim – we, Yisra’ĕl, know You!’

<sup>3</sup> “Yisra’ĕl has rejected what is good, an enemy pursues him.

<sup>4</sup> “They have made sovereigns, but not from Me. They have made rulers, but I have not known. From their silver and gold they made idols for themselves, so that they are cut off.

<sup>5</sup> “O Shomeron, your calf has been cast off! My wrath has burned against them. How long shall they be incapable of innocence?

<sup>6</sup> “For from Yisra’ĕl is even this: a workman made it, and it is not Elohim! For the calf of Shomeron is splinters!

<sup>7</sup> “For they sow the wind, and reap the whirlwind. The stalk has no bud, it yields no grain. If it does yield, strangers swallow it up.

<sup>8</sup> “Yisra’ĕl has been swallowed up. They have now become among the nations as a vessel in which is no pleasure.

<sup>9</sup> “For they themselves have gone up to Ashshur. A wild donkey alone by itself is Ephrayim, they have hired lovers.

<sup>10</sup> “Also, although they sold themselves among the nations, this time I shall gather them, when they have suffered for a while from the burden of a sovereign, of rulers.

<sup>11</sup> “Since Ephrayim has made many altars for sin, they have been altars for sinning to him.

<sup>12</sup> “I have written for him numerous matters of My Torah – they were regarded as strange.

<sup>13</sup> “As for My offerings: they slaughter flesh and they eat. יהוה shall not accept them. Now does He remember their crookedness and punish their sins. Let them return to Mitsrayim!

<sup>14</sup> “For Yisra’ĕl has forgotten his Maker, and has built palaces. And Yehuḏah has increased walled cities. But I shall send fire upon his cities, and it shall devour his strongholds.”
