<sup>1</sup> Ephrayim is feeding on wind, and pursuing an east wind. All the day he increases falsehood and ruin. And they make a covenant with Ashshur, and oil is sent to Mitsrayim.

<sup>2</sup> And יהוה has a controversy with Yehuḏah, to punish Ya‛aqoḇ according to his ways, to repay him according to his deeds.

<sup>3</sup> He took his brother by the heel in the womb, and in his strength he strove with Elohim.

<sup>4</sup> He strove with the Messenger and overcame, he wept and sought His favour. He found Him in Bĕyth Ĕl, and there He spoke to us –

<sup>5</sup> even יהוה Elohim of hosts, יהוה is His remembrance.

<sup>6</sup> Therefore, return to your Elohim. Guard kindness and right-ruling, and wait on your Elohim continually.

<sup>7</sup> A merchant! In his hand are scales of deceit, he loved to oppress.

<sup>8</sup> And Ephrayim says, “Indeed, I have become rich, I have found wealth for myself. In all my labours they shall find in me no crookedness that is sin.”

<sup>9</sup> “But I am יהוה your Elohim since the land of Mitsrayim, again I shall make you dwell in tents as in the days of the appointed time.

<sup>10</sup> “And I have spoken to the prophets, and have increased visions. And through the prophets I gave parables.”

<sup>11</sup> Is Gil‛aḏ wicked? Certainly, they have been false! In Gilgal they have offered bulls. Also their altars are as heaps on a ploughed field.

<sup>12</sup> And when Ya‛aqoḇ fled to the country of Aram, Yisra’ĕl served for a wife, and for a wife he kept watch.

<sup>13</sup> And by a prophet יהוה brought Yisra’ĕl out of Mitsrayim, and by a prophet he was watched over.

<sup>14</sup> Ephrayim has provoked most bitterly. So his Master left his blood-guilt on him, and repaid him for his reproach.
