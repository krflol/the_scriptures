<sup>1</sup> The word of יהוה that came to Hoshĕa son of Be’ĕri, in the days of Uzziyah, Yotham, Aḥaz, and Ḥizqiyah, sovereigns of Yehuḏah, and in the days of Yaroḇ‛am son of Yo’ash, sovereign of Yisra’ĕl.

<sup>2</sup> The beginning of the word of יהוה with Hoshĕa. And יהוה said to Hoshĕa, “Go, take yourself a woman of whoring and children of whoring, for the land has utterly whored away from יהוה.”

<sup>3</sup> So he went and took Gomer, daughter of Diḇlayim, and she conceived and bore him a son.

<sup>4</sup> And יהוה said to him, “Call his name Yizre‛ĕl, for in a little while I shall revenge the bloodshed of Yizre‛ĕl on the house of Yĕhu, and put an end to the reign of the house of Yisra’ĕl.

<sup>5</sup> “And it shall be in that day that I shall break the bow of Yisra’ĕl in the Valley of Yizre‛ĕl.”

<sup>6</sup> And she conceived again and bore a daughter. And He said to him, “Call her name Lo-Ruḥamah, for no longer do I have compassion on the house of Yisra’ĕl so as to forgive them at all.

<sup>7</sup> “But I shall have compassion on the house of Yehuḏah and save them by יהוה their Elohim, and not save them by bow or by sword or battle, by horses or horsemen.”

<sup>8</sup> And she weaned Lo-Ruḥamah, and conceived and bore a son,

<sup>9</sup> then He said, “Call his name Lo-Ammi, for you are not My people, and I am not for you.

<sup>10</sup> “Yet the number of the children of Yisra’ĕl shall be as the sand of the sea, which is not measured nor counted. And it shall be in the place where it was said to them, ‘You are not My people,’ they shall be called, ‘You are the sons of the living Ĕl.’

<sup>11</sup> “And the children of Yehuḏah and the children of Yisra’ĕl shall be gathered together, and appoint for themselves one head, and shall come up out of the earth, for great is the day of Yizre‛ĕl!
