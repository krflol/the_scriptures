<sup>1</sup> O Yisra’ĕl, do not rejoice with exultation like the peoples, for you have whored from your Elohim. You have loved a love-fee at all threshing-floors.

<sup>2</sup> Threshing floor and winepress shall not feed them, and new wine shall fail in her.

<sup>3</sup> They shall not dwell in the land of יהוה, but Ephrayim shall return to Mitsrayim, and eat unclean food in Ashshur.

<sup>4</sup> They do not pour wine offerings to יהוה, nor are their offerings pleasing to Him – it being like bread of mourners to them, all who eat it are defiled. For their bread is for their life, it does not come into the House of יהוה.

<sup>5</sup> What do you do for the appointed meeting, and in the day of the festival of יהוה ?

<sup>6</sup> For look, they shall go because of destruction – Mitsrayim gathers them up, Moph buries them, nettles possess their valuables of silver, thorns are in their tents.

<sup>7</sup> The days of punishment have come, the days of retribution have come. Yisra’ĕl knows! The prophet is a fool, the ‘man of the Spirit’ is mad, because of the greatness of your crookedness, and great is the enmity.

<sup>8</sup> Elohim’s watchman over you, Ephrayim, is the prophet, but a trapper’s snare is in all his ways. Enmity is in the House of his Elohim.

<sup>9</sup> They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gib‛ah. He remembers their crookedness, He punishes their sins.

<sup>10</sup> “I found Yisra’ĕl like grapes in the wilderness. I saw your fathers as the first-fruits on the fig tree in its beginning. They themselves have gone to Ba‛al Pe‛or, and separated themselves to shame, and became as abominable as that which they loved.

<sup>11</sup> “Ephrayim is like a bird, their esteem has flown away – no birth, and none with child, and no conception!

<sup>12</sup> “Though they bring up their children, I shall make them childless, without man. For it is woe to them when I turn away from them!

<sup>13</sup> “I have seen Ephrayim, like Tsor, planted in a pleasant place. But Ephrayim shall bring out his children to the murderer.”

<sup>14</sup> Give them, O יהוה – give what? Give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.

<sup>15</sup> “All their evil is in Gilgal, for there I have hated them. Because of the evil of their deeds I drive them from My house, no more do I love them. All their rulers are rebels.

<sup>16</sup> “Ephrayim has been smitten, their root has dried up, they yield no fruit. Even if they bear children, I shall put to death the precious ones of their womb.”

<sup>17</sup> My Elohim rejects them, because they have not obeyed Him, so that they become wanderers among the gentiles!
