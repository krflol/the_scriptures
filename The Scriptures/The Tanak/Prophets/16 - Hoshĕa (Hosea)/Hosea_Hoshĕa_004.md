<sup>1</sup> Hear the word of יהוה, you children of Yisra’ĕl, for יהוה has a case against the inhabitants of the land: “For there is no truth or kindness or knowledge of Elohim in the land.

<sup>2</sup> “Swearing, and lying, and murdering, and stealing, and committing adultery have increased. And bloodshed follows bloodshed.

<sup>3</sup> “Therefore the land mourns, and everyone living there languishes, with the beasts of the field and the birds of the heavens. And the fish of the sea are taken away.

<sup>4</sup> “However, let no one strive or reprove another, for your people are like those striving with a priest.

<sup>5</sup> “And you shall stumble in the day, and the prophet shall also stumble with you in the night. And I shall make your mother perish.

<sup>6</sup> “My people have perished for lack of knowledge. Because you have rejected knowledge, I reject you from being priest for Me. Since you have forgotten the Torah of your Elohim, I also forget your children.

<sup>7</sup> “As they were increased, so they sinned against Me. My esteem they have changed into shame.

<sup>8</sup> “They eat the sin of My people, and lift up their desire to their crookedness.

<sup>9</sup> “And it shall be: like people, like priest. And I shall punish them for their ways, and reward them for their deeds.

<sup>10</sup> “And they shall eat but not be satisfied, they shall whore but not increase, for they have stopped obeying יהוה.

<sup>11</sup> “Whoring, and wine, and new wine enslave the heart.

<sup>12</sup> “My people ask from their Wood, and their Staff declares to them. For a spirit of whorings has led them astray, and they went whoring from under their Elohim.

<sup>13</sup> “They slaughter on the mountaintops, and burn incense on the hills, under oak and poplars and terebinth, because its shade is good. Therefore your daughters commit whoring, and your brides commit adultery.

<sup>14</sup> “I would not punish your daughters when they commit whoring, nor your brides when they commit adultery, for the men themselves go aside with whores, and offer with cult prostitutes – a people that do not understand are thrust down!

<sup>15</sup> “Though you are a whore, Yisra’ĕl, let not Yehuḏah become guilty. Do not come up to Gilgal, nor go up to Bĕyth Awen, nor swear an oath, saying, ‘As יהוה lives!’

<sup>16</sup> “For Yisra’ĕl is stubborn, like a stubborn calf. Would יהוה now feed them like a lamb in a broad place?

<sup>17</sup> “Ephrayim is joined to idols, let him alone.

<sup>18</sup> “Their drink is sour, they have whored continually. Her rulers wildly loved shame.

<sup>19</sup> “A wind has bound her up in its wings, and they are ashamed because of their slaughterings.
