<sup>1</sup> O Yisra’ĕl, return to יהוה your Elohim, for you have stumbled by your crookedness.

<sup>2</sup> Take words with you, and return to יהוה. Say to Him, “Take away all crookedness, and accept what is good, and we render the bulls of our lips.

<sup>3</sup> “Ashshur does not save us. We do not ride on horses, nor ever again do we say to the work of our hands, ‘Our mighty ones.’ For the fatherless finds compassion in You.”

<sup>4</sup> “I shall heal their backsliding, I shall love them spontaneously, for My displeasure has turned away from him.

<sup>5</sup> “I shall be like the dew to Yisra’ĕl. He shall blossom like the lily, and cast out his roots like Leḇanon.

<sup>6</sup> “His branches shall spread, and his splendour shall be like an olive tree, and his fragrance like Leḇanon.

<sup>7</sup> “Those who dwell under his shadow shall return. They shall revive like grain, and blossom like the vine, and become as fragrant as the wine of Leḇanon.

<sup>8</sup> “What more has Ephrayim to do with idols? It is I who answer and look after him. I am like a green cypress tree, your fruit comes from Me.”

<sup>9</sup> Who is wise and understands these words, discerning and knows them? For the ways of יהוה are straight, and the righteous walk in them, but the transgressors stumble in them.
