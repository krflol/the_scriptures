<sup>1</sup> Yisra’ĕl is a degenerate vine, he brings forth fruit for himself. As his fruit increased, he increased the altars. And the better his land, the better they made the pillars.

<sup>2</sup> Their heart has been slippery, now they are guilty. He breaks down their altars, He destroys their pillars.

<sup>3</sup> For now they say, “We have no sovereign, because we did not fear יהוה. What would the sovereign do for us?”

<sup>4</sup> They have spoken words, swearing falsely in making a covenant. Therefore judgment shall spring up like poisonous weeds in the furrows of the field.

<sup>5</sup> The inhabitants of Shomeron fear because of the calf of Bĕyth Awen. For its people shall mourn for it, as well as its priests who used to rejoice over it, because of its esteem that has departed from it.

<sup>6</sup> It is also brought to Ashshur as a present for Sovereign Yarĕḇ. Ephrayim does receive shame, and Yisra’ĕl is put to shame through his counsel.

<sup>7</sup> Shomeron is cut off, her sovereign is like a twig on the surface of the water.

<sup>8</sup> And the high places of Awen, the sin of Yisra’ĕl, shall be destroyed, thorn and thistle come up on their altars. And they shall say to the mountains, “Cover us!” and to the hills, “Fall on us!”

<sup>9</sup> “O Yisra’ĕl, you have sinned from the days of Gib‛ah. There they stood! The battle in Gib‛ah against the children of perversity did not overtake them.

<sup>10</sup> “When I desire, then I bind them. And peoples shall be gathered against them when I bind them for their double guilt.

<sup>11</sup> “And Ephrayim is a trained heifer, loving to thresh grain. But I Myself shall pass over her comely neck – I put Ephrayim to the yoke, Yehuḏah ploughs, Ya‛aqoḇ harrows for him.”

<sup>12</sup> Sow for yourselves righteousness, reap according to kindness, break up your tillable ground, it is time to seek יהוה, till He comes and rains righteousness on you.

<sup>13</sup> You have ploughed wrongness, you have reaped unrighteousness, you have eaten the fruit of lying, because you trusted in your own way, in your many mighty men.

<sup>14</sup> And uproar shall arise among your people, and all your strongholds shall be ravaged as Shalman ravaged Bĕyth Arbĕl in the day of battle – a mother dashed in pieces on her children.

<sup>15</sup> Thus it shall be done to you, O Bĕyth Ĕl, because of the evil of your wickedness. At dawn the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl is completely cut off!
