<sup>1</sup> And the word of יהוה came to Yonah the second time, saying,

<sup>2</sup> “Arise, go to Ninewĕh, that great city, and proclaim to it the message that I am speaking to you.”

<sup>3</sup> And Yonah arose and went to Ninewĕh, according to the word of יהוה. Now Ninewĕh was a great city before Elohim, of three day’s journey.

<sup>4</sup> And Yonah began to go in to the city on the first day’s walk. And he cried out and said, “Yet forty days, and Ninewĕh shall be overthrown!”

<sup>5</sup> And the men of Ninewĕh believed in Elohim, and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest to the least of them.

<sup>6</sup> And the word reached the sovereign of Ninewĕh, so he arose from his throne and took off his robe, and covered himself with sackcloth and sat in ashes.

<sup>7</sup> And he proclaimed and said throughout Ninewĕh, “By decree of the sovereign and his nobles: No man or beast, herd or flock, shall taste whatever – let them not eat, let them not even drink water.

<sup>8</sup> “But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and call mightily to Elohim. And let each one turn from his evil way and from the violence that is in his hands.

<sup>9</sup> “Who knows whether Elohim does turn and relent, and shall turn away from the heat of His displeasure, so that we do not perish?”

<sup>10</sup> And Elohim saw their works, that they turned from their evil way. And Elohim relented from the evil which He had said He would do to them, and He did not do it.
