<sup>1</sup> And Yonah prayed to יהוה his Elohim from the stomach of the fish.

<sup>2</sup> And he said, “I called to יהוה because of my distress, and He answered me. From the stomach of the grave I cried, and You heard my voice.

<sup>3</sup> “For You threw me into the deep, into the heart of the seas, and the floods surrounded me. All Your breakers and Your waves passed over me.

<sup>4</sup> “So I said, ‘I have been driven away from Your eyes. Would I ever look again toward Your set-apart Hĕḵal?’

<sup>5</sup> “Waters encompassed me, unto life, the deep closed around me, weeds were wrapped around my head.

<sup>6</sup> “I went down to the base of the mountains, the earth with its bars were behind me forever. But You brought up my life from the pit, O יהוה, my Elohim.

<sup>7</sup> “When my life fainted within me, I remembered יהוה. And my prayer went up to You, into Your set-apart Hĕḵal.

<sup>8</sup> “Those observing false worthlessnesses forsake their own kindness.

<sup>9</sup> “But I offer to You with the voice of thanksgiving, I pay what I have vowed. Deliverance is of יהוה.”

<sup>10</sup> Then יהוה spoke to the fish, and it vomited Yonah on the dry land.
