<sup>1</sup> And He said to me, “Son of man, stand on your feet, so that I speak to you.”

<sup>2</sup> And the Spirit entered into me when He spoke to me, and set me on my feet. And I heard Him who was speaking to me.

<sup>3</sup> And He said to me, “Son of man, I am sending you to the children of Yisra’ĕl, to a nation of rebels who have rebelled against Me. They and their fathers have transgressed against Me, until this day.

<sup>4</sup> “And the children are stiff of face and hard of heart to whom I am sending you, and you shall say to them, ‘Thus said the Master יהוה.’

<sup>5</sup> “And they – whether they hear or whether they refuse, for they are a rebellious house – shall know that a prophet has been in their midst.

<sup>6</sup> “And you, son of man, do not be afraid of them, nor be afraid of their words, though thistles and thorns are with you and you dwell among scorpions. Do not be afraid of their words or discouraged by their looks, for they are a rebellious house.

<sup>7</sup> “And you shall speak My words to them, whether they hear or whether they refuse, for they are rebellious.

<sup>8</sup> “And you, son of man, hear what I am speaking to you. Do not be rebellious like that rebellious house, open your mouth and eat what I am giving you.”

<sup>9</sup> And I looked and saw a hand stretched out to me. And see, a scroll of a book was in it,

<sup>10</sup> and He spread it before me, and it was written on the inside and on the outside. And written on it were lamentations and mourning and woe.
