<sup>1</sup> In the tenth year, in the tenth month, on the twelfth of the month, the word of יהוה came to me, saying,

<sup>2</sup> “Son of man, set your face against Pharaoh the sovereign of Mitsrayim, and prophesy against him, and against Mitsrayim, all of it.

<sup>3</sup> “Speak, and you shall say, ‘Thus said the Master יהוה, “See, I am against you, O Pharaoh sovereign of Mitsrayim, O great monster who lies in the midst of his rivers, who has said, ‘My River is my own, and I, I have made it for myself.’

<sup>4</sup> “And I shall put hooks in your jaws, and I shall make the fish of your rivers cling to your scales. And I shall bring you up out of the midst of your rivers, and all the fish in your rivers cling to your scales.

<sup>5</sup> “And I shall leave you in the wilderness, you and all the fish of your rivers. On the face of the field you shall fall, and you shall not be picked up or gathered. I shall give you as food to the beasts of the field and to the birds of the heavens.

<sup>6</sup> “And all the inhabitants of Mitsrayim shall know that I am יהוה, because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Yisra’ĕl.

<sup>7</sup> “When they grasped you with the hand, you broke and tore all their shoulders. When they leaned on you, you broke and made all their loins shake.”

<sup>8</sup> ‘Therefore thus said the Master יהוה, “See, I am bringing a sword upon you and shall cut off from you man and beast.

<sup>9</sup> “And the land of Mitsrayim shall become a desert and a waste. And they shall know that I am יהוה, because he said, ‘The River is mine, and I have made it.’

<sup>10</sup> “Therefore see, I am against you and against your rivers, and shall make the land of Mitsrayim an utter waste and a desert, from Miḡdol to Sewĕnĕh, as far as the border of Kush.

<sup>11</sup> “No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited for forty years.

<sup>12</sup> “And I shall make the land of Mitsrayim a desert in the midst of the lands that are waste. And among the cities that are ruined, her cities shall be a waste forty years. And I shall scatter the Mitsrites among the nations, and I shall disperse them throughout the lands.”

<sup>13</sup> ‘For thus said the Master יהוה, “At the end of forty years I shall gather the Mitsrites from the peoples among whom they were scattered.

<sup>14</sup> “And I shall turn back the captivity of Mitsrayim and I shall bring them back to the land of Pathros, to the land of their birth, and there they shall be a lowly reign,

<sup>15</sup> being the lowliest of reigns, and never again exalt itself above the nations. And I shall make them few so as not to rule over the nations.

<sup>16</sup> “And no longer is it to be the refuge of the house of Yisra’ĕl, bringing to remembrance their crookedness when they turned to follow them. And they shall know that I am the Master יהוה.” ’ ”

<sup>17</sup> And it came to be in the twenty-seventh year, in the first month, on the first of the month, that the word of יהוה came to me, saying,

<sup>18</sup> “Son of man, Neḇuḵaḏretstsar sovereign of Baḇel made his army to serve a great service against Tsor, every head was made bald and every shoulder worn bare. But he and his army received no reward from Tsor, for the service he served against it.

<sup>19</sup> “Therefore thus said the Master יהוה, ‘See, I am giving the land of Mitsrayim to Neḇuḵaḏretstsar sovereign of Baḇel. And he shall take away her wealth, take her spoil, and remove her pillage. And it shall be a reward for his army.

<sup>20</sup> ‘I have given him the land of Mitsrayim as a reward for his labour, because they worked for Me,’ declares the Master יהוה.

<sup>21</sup> ‘In that day I shall make the horn of the house of Yisra’ĕl to spring forth, while I open your mouth to speak in their midst. And they shall know that I am יהוה.’ ”
