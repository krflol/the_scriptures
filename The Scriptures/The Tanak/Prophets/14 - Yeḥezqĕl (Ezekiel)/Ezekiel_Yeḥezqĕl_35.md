<sup>1</sup> And the word of יהוה came to me, saying,

<sup>2</sup> “Son of man, set your face against Mount Sĕ‛ir and prophesy against it,

<sup>3</sup> and you shall say to it, ‘Thus said the Master יהוה, “See, O Mount Sĕ‛ir, I am against you, and shall stretch out My hand against you, and shall make you a ruin and a waste.

<sup>4</sup> “Your cities I destroy, and let you be a ruin. And you shall know that I am יהוה.

<sup>5</sup> “Because you have had a continuous enmity, and handed the children of Yisra’ĕl over to the power of the sword at the time of their calamity, at the time of the crookedness of the end.

<sup>6</sup> “Therefore, as I live,” declares the Master יהוה, “I shall appoint you for blood, and let blood pursue you. Since you did not hate blood, therefore blood shall pursue you.

<sup>7</sup> “And I shall make Mount Sĕ‛ir a ruin and a waste, and cut off from it the one who leaves and the one who returns,

<sup>8</sup> and shall fill its mountains with the slain, those slain by the sword falling on your hills and in your valleys and in all your ravines.

<sup>9</sup> “I shall make you an everlasting ruin, and your cities uninhabited. And you shall know that I am יהוה.

<sup>10</sup> “Because you have said, ‘These two nations and these two lands are mine, and we shall possess them,’ although יהוה was there,

<sup>11</sup> therefore, as I live,” declares the Master יהוה, “I shall do according to your displeasure and according to your envy which you showed in your hatred against them. And I shall make Myself known among them when I judge you.

<sup>12</sup> “And you shall know that I am יהוה. I have heard all your scorns which you have spoken against the mountains of Yisra’ĕl, saying, ‘They are laid waste, they were given to us for food.’

<sup>13</sup> “And with your mouth you have boasted against Me and increased your words against Me – I Myself have heard.”

<sup>14</sup> ‘Thus said the Master יהוה, “As all the earth is rejoicing I shall make you a ruin.

<sup>15</sup> “As you rejoiced because the inheritance of the house of Yisra’ĕl was laid waste, so I do to you: be a ruin, O Mount Sĕ‛ir, as well as all of Eḏom, all of it! And they shall know that I am יהוה.” ’
