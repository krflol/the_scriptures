<sup>1</sup> And he led me to the gate, the gate facing east.

<sup>2</sup> And see, the esteem of the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl came from the way of the east. And His voice was like the sound of many waters, and the earth shone from His esteem.

<sup>3</sup> And it was like the appearance of the vision which I saw, like the vision which I saw when He came to destroy the city. And the visions were like the vision which I saw by the River Keḇar, and I fell on my face.

<sup>4</sup> And the esteem of יהוה came into the House by way of the gate facing east.

<sup>5</sup> And the Spirit took me up and brought me into the inner courtyard. And see, the esteem of יהוה filled the House.

<sup>6</sup> And I heard someone speaking to me from the House, while a man stood beside me.

<sup>7</sup> And He said to me, “Son of man, this is the place of My throne and the place of the soles of My feet, when I dwell in the midst of the children of Yisra’ĕl forever, and the house of Yisra’ĕl shall no longer defile My set-apart Name, they nor their sovereigns, by their whoring and by the corpses of their sovereigns on their high places.

<sup>8</sup> “When they placed their threshold by My threshold, and their doorpost by My doorpost, with a wall between them and Me, they defiled My set-apart Name by the abominations which they have done. So I consumed them in My displeasure.

<sup>9</sup> “Now let them put their whoring and the corpses of their sovereigns far away from Me, and I shall dwell in their midst forever.

<sup>10</sup> “Son of man, explain the House to the house of Yisra’ĕl, and when they are ashamed of their crookednesses, they shall measure the measurements.

<sup>11</sup> “And since they shall be ashamed of all that they did, make known to them the design of the House and its structure, and its exits and its entrances, its entire design and all its laws, and all its forms and all its Torot. And write it down before their eyes, so that they observe its entire design and all its laws, and shall do them.

<sup>12</sup> “This is the Torah of the House: Upon the mountaintop, all the boundary of it, all around, is most set-apart. See, this is the Torah of the House.

<sup>13</sup> “And these are the measurements of the altar in cubits, that cubit being one cubit and a handbreadth, and the base one cubit high and one cubit wide, with a rim all around its edge of one span. And this is the upper part of the altar.

<sup>14</sup> “And from the base on the ground to the lower ledge, two cubits, and the width of the ledge one cubit, and from the smaller ledge to the larger ledge four cubits, and the width of the ledge one cubit.

<sup>15</sup> “And the altar hearth is four cubits high, and four horns extending upward from the hearth.

<sup>16</sup> “And the altar hearth is twelve cubits long, and twelve wide, square at its four corners.

<sup>17</sup> “And the ledge is fourteen long and fourteen wide on its four sides, with a rim of half a cubit around it, and its base one cubit all around, and its steps face east.”

<sup>18</sup> And He said to me, “Son of man, thus said the Master יהוה, ‘These are the laws for the altar on the day when it is made, for offering burnt offerings on it, and for sprinkling blood on it.

<sup>19</sup> ‘And you shall give a young bull for a sin offering to the priests, the Lĕwites, who are of the seed of Tsaḏoq, who approach unto Me,’ declares the Master יהוה.

<sup>20</sup> ‘And you shall take some of its blood and put it on the four horns of the altar, on the four corners of the ledge, and on the rim around it, and shall cleanse it and make atonement for it.

<sup>21</sup> ‘And you shall take the bull of the sin offering, and shall burn it in the appointed place of the House, outside the set-apart place.

<sup>22</sup> ‘And on the second day you bring a male goat, a perfect one, for a sin offering. And they shall cleanse the altar, as they cleansed it with the bull.

<sup>23</sup> ‘When you have ended cleansing it, bring a young bull, a perfect one, and a ram from the flock, a perfect one.

<sup>24</sup> ‘And you shall bring them before יהוה, and the priests shall throw salt on them and offer them up as a burnt offering to יהוה.

<sup>25</sup> ‘Prepare a goat for a sin offering daily for seven days, and prepare a young bull and a ram from the flock, perfect ones.

<sup>26</sup> ‘For seven days they shall make atonement for the altar and cleanse it, and ordain it.

<sup>27</sup> ‘And when these days are completed it shall be, on the eighth day and thereafter, that the priests make your burnt offerings and your peace offerings on the altar, and I shall accept you,’ declares the Master יהוה.”
