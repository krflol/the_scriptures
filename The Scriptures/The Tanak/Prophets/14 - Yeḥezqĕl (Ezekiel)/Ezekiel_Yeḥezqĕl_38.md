<sup>1</sup> And the word of יהוה came to me, saying,

<sup>2</sup> “Son of man, set your face against Goḡ, of the land of Maḡoḡ, the prince of Rosh, Mesheḵ, and Tuḇal, and prophesy against him.

<sup>3</sup> “And you shall say, ‘Thus says the Master יהוה, “See, I am against you, O Goḡ, the prince of Rosh, Mesheḵ, and Tuḇal.

<sup>4</sup> “And I shall turn you around, and I shall put hooks into your jaws, and shall lead you out, with all your army, horses and horsemen, clad perfectly, a great assembly with armour and shields, all of them handling swords.

<sup>5</sup> “Persia, Kush, and Put are with them, all of them with shield and helmet,

<sup>6</sup> “Gomer and all its bands, the house of Toḡarmah from the far north and all its bands, many peoples with you.

<sup>7</sup> “Be ready, prepare yourself, you and all your assemblies that are assembled unto you. And you shall be a guard for them.

<sup>8</sup> “After many days you shall be called up. In the latter years you shall come into the land of those brought back from the sword and gathered from many people on the mountains of Yisra’ĕl, which had been a continual waste. But they were brought out of the gentiles, and all of them shall dwell safely.

<sup>9</sup> “And you shall go up, coming like a storm, covering the land like a cloud, you and all your bands and many peoples with you.”

<sup>10</sup> ‘Thus said the Master יהוה, “And it shall be in that day that words arise in your heart, and you shall devise an evil plan:

<sup>11</sup> “And you shall say, ‘Let me go up against a land of unwalled villages, let me go to those at rest who dwell safely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither bars nor gates,’

<sup>12</sup> to take plunder and to take booty, to stretch out your hand against the waste places that are again inhabited, and against a people gathered from the gentiles, acquiring livestock and goods, who dwell in the middle of the land.

<sup>13</sup> “Sheḇa, and Deḏan, and the merchants of Tarshish, and all their young lions shall say to you, ‘Have you come to take plunder? Have you gathered your army to take booty, to bear away silver and gold, to take away livestock and goods, to take great plunder?’ ” ’

<sup>14</sup> “Therefore, son of man, prophesy, and you shall say to Goḡ, ‘Thus said the Master יהוה, “In that day when My people Yisra’ĕl dwell safely, would you not know?

<sup>15</sup> “And you shall come from your place out of the far north, you and many peoples with you, all of them riding on horses, a great assembly and a mighty army.

<sup>16</sup> “And you shall come up against My people Yisra’ĕl like a cloud, to cover the land – in the latter days it shall be. And I shall bring you against My land, in order that the gentiles know Me, when I am set apart in you, O Goḡ, before their eyes.”

<sup>17</sup> ‘Thus said the Master יהוה, “Are you the one I spoke of in former days by My servants the prophets of Yisra’ĕl, who prophesied for years in those days, to bring you against them?

<sup>18</sup> “And it shall be on that day, on the day when Goḡ comes against the land of Yisra’ĕl,” declares the Master יהוה, “that My wrath shall come up in My face.

<sup>19</sup> “For in My jealousy and in the fire of My wrath I have spoken, ‘On that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Yisra’ĕl,

<sup>20</sup> so that the fish of the sea, and the birds of the heavens, and the beasts of the field, and all creeping creatures that creep on the earth, and all men who are on the face of the earth shall shake at My presence. And the mountains shall be thrown down, and the steep places shall fall, and every wall fall to the ground.’

<sup>21</sup> “And I shall call for a sword against Goḡ on all My mountains,” declares the Master יהוה, “the sword of each one being against his brother.

<sup>22</sup> “And I shall judge him with pestilence and blood, and rain down flooding rain and hailstones, fire and sulphur, on him and on his bands and on the many peoples who are with him.

<sup>23</sup> “And I shall exalt Myself and set Myself apart, and I shall be known in the eyes of many nations. And they shall know that I am יהוה.” ’
