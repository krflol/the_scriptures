<sup>2</sup> and shall turn you around and lead you on, and bring you up from the uttermost parts of the north, and bring you against the mountains of Yisra’ĕl,

<sup>3</sup> and shall smite the bow out of your left hand, and make the arrows fall from your right hand.

<sup>4</sup> “On the mountains of Yisra’ĕl you shall fall, you and all your bands and the peoples who are with you. To the birds of prey of every sort and to the beasts of the field I shall give you for food.

<sup>5</sup> “On the face of the field you shall fall, for I have spoken,” declares the Master יהוה.

<sup>6</sup> “And I shall send fire upon Maḡoḡ and on those who live undisturbed in the coastlands. And they shall know that I am יהוה.

<sup>7</sup> “And I shall make My set-apart Name known in the midst of My people Yisra’ĕl, and not let My set-apart Name be profaned any more. And the gentiles shall know that I am יהוה, the Set-apart One in Yisra’ĕl.

<sup>8</sup> “See, it shall come, and it shall be done,” declares the Master יהוה. “This is the day of which I have spoken.

<sup>9</sup> “And those who inhabit the cities of Yisra’ĕl shall go out and set on fire and burn the weapons, both the shields and armour, the bows and arrows, the clubs and spears. And they shall make fires with them for seven years,

<sup>10</sup> and take no wood from the field nor cut down any from the forests, for with the weapons they make fire. And they shall plunder those who plundered them, and loot those who looted them,” declares the Master יהוה.

<sup>11</sup> “And it shall be on that day that I give Goḡ a burial site there in Yisra’ĕl, the valley of those passing by east of the sea, and stopping those passing by, because there they shall bury Goḡ and all his crowd, and shall call it the Valley of Hamon Goḡ.

<sup>14</sup> “And they shall separate men who continually pass through the land, burying those who were passing through, those left on the surface of the ground, in order to cleanse it. At the end of seven months they shall search,

<sup>15</sup> and those passing through shall pass through the land, and when anyone sees a man’s bone, he shall set up a sign beside it, till the buriers have buried it in the Valley of Hamon Goḡ.

<sup>16</sup> “And also a city named Hamonah shall be there. So they shall cleanse the land.” ’

<sup>17</sup> “And you, son of man, thus said the Master יהוה, ‘Speak to every sort of bird and to every beast of the field, “Assemble yourselves and come, gather from all around to My offering which I am slaughtering for you, a great offering on the mountains of Yisra’ĕl, and you shall eat flesh and drink blood.
