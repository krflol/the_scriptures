<sup>1</sup> And he brought me into the Hĕḵal, and he measured the doorposts, six cubits wide on one side and six cubits wide on the other side, the width of the Tent.

<sup>2</sup> And the entrance was ten cubits wide, and the side walls of the entrance were five cubits on this side and five cubits on the other side. And he measured its length, forty cubits, and twenty cubits wide.

<sup>3</sup> And he went inside and measured the doorposts, two cubits, and the entrance six cubits high, and the width of the entrance seven cubits.

<sup>4</sup> And he measured the length, twenty cubits, and the width twenty cubits, to the front of the Hĕḵal. And he said to me, “This is the Most Set-apart Place.”

<sup>5</sup> And he measured the wall of the House, six cubits, and the width of each side room all around the House was four cubits on every side.

<sup>6</sup> And the side rooms were on three levels, one above the other, thirty rooms on each level, they rested on ledges which were for the side rooms all around, to be supported, but not fastened to the wall of the House.

<sup>7</sup> And there was a broadening and a winding upwards for the side rooms, for the winding around the House went up like steps. And the width of the structure increased as one went up from the lowest level to the highest by way of the middle one.

<sup>8</sup> And I saw the height all around the House: the foundation of the side rooms, a rod’s length of six cubits.

<sup>9</sup> The thickness of the outer wall of the side rooms was five cubits, and that which was left between the side rooms of the House

<sup>10</sup> and the rooms was a width of twenty cubits all around the House on every side.

<sup>11</sup> And the door of the side room was toward the open space, one door toward the north and another toward the south. And the width of the place of the open space was five cubits all around.

<sup>12</sup> And the building that was in front of the separate place at the side toward the west was seventy cubits wide, and the wall of the building was five cubits thick all around, and its length ninety cubits.

<sup>13</sup> Then he measured the House, one hundred cubits long. And the separate place with the building and its walls, were one hundred cubits long,

<sup>14</sup> and the width of the front of the House, and of the separate place eastward, was one hundred cubits.

<sup>15</sup> And he measured the length of the building to the front of the separate place behind it, and its galleries on the one side and on the other side, one hundred cubits, as well as the inner Hĕḵal and the porches of the courtyard.

<sup>16</sup> The doorposts and the narrowed window frames, and the galleries all around, their three levels opposite the threshold, were panelled with wood. From the ground to the windows, and the windows were covered,

<sup>17</sup> from the space above the door, even to the inner house, as well as outside, and on every wall all around, inside and outside, by measure.

<sup>18</sup> And it was made with keruḇim and palm trees, and a palm tree between keruḇ and keruḇ. A keruḇ had two faces,

<sup>19</sup> so that the face of a man was toward a palm tree on one side, and the face of a young lion toward a palm tree on the other side – made on all the House all around.

<sup>20</sup> From the floor to the space above the door, and on the wall of the Hĕḵal, keruḇim and palm trees were carved.

<sup>21</sup> The doorposts of the Hĕḵal were square, and the front of the set-apart place, the appearance of one was like the appearance of the other.

<sup>22</sup> The altar was of wood, three cubits high, and its length two cubits. And its corners, and its length, and its sides were of wood. And he said to me, “This is the table that is before יהוה.”

<sup>23</sup> And the Hĕḵal and the set-apart place had two doors.

<sup>24</sup> And each of the doors had two panels, two folding panels, two panels for one door and two panels for the other door.

<sup>25</sup> And keruḇim and palm trees were carved on the doors of the Hĕḵal, like those carved on the walls. And thick wood was on the front of the porch outside.

<sup>26</sup> And narrowed window frames and palm trees were on one side and on the other, on the sides of the porch, and on the side rooms of the House, and thick wood.
