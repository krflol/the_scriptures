<sup>1</sup> And I looked and saw in the expanse that was above the head of the keruḇim, like a sapphire stone, having the appearance of the likeness of a throne.

<sup>2</sup> And He spoke to the man clothed with linen, and said, “Go in among the wheels, under the keruḇ, and fill your hands with coals of fire from among the keruḇim, and scatter over the city.” And he went in before my eyes.

<sup>3</sup> And the keruḇim were standing on the south side of the House when the man went in, and the cloud filled the inner court.

<sup>4</sup> And the esteem of יהוה went up from the keruḇ, over the threshold of the House. And the House was filled with the cloud, and the court was filled with the brightness of the esteem of יהוה.

<sup>5</sup> And the sound of the wings of the keruḇim was heard in the outer court, like the voice of Ĕl Shaddai when He speaks.

<sup>6</sup> And it came to be, when He commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, “Take fire from among the wheels, from among the keruḇim,” that he went in and stood beside the wheel.

<sup>7</sup> And the keruḇ stretched out his hand from among the keruḇim to the fire that was among the keruḇim, and took some, and put it into the hands of the man clothed with linen, who took it and went out.

<sup>8</sup> And the form of a man’s hand was seen under the wings of the keruḇim.

<sup>9</sup> And I looked and saw four wheels beside the keruḇim, one wheel beside each keruḇ, and the wheels’ appearance was like the colour of beryl stone.

<sup>10</sup> As for their appearance, all four looked alike; as if a wheel in the middle of a wheel.

<sup>11</sup> When they went, they went on their four sides; they did not turn aside when they went, but went in the direction the head was facing. They did not turn aside when they went.

<sup>12</sup> And their entire bodies, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels that the four had, were covered with eyes all around.

<sup>13</sup> The wheels were called in my hearing, “Wheel.”

<sup>14</sup> And each one had four faces: the first face was the face of a keruḇ, and the second face the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.

<sup>15</sup> And the keruḇim were lifted up – it was the living creature I saw by the River Keḇar.

<sup>16</sup> And when the keruḇim went the wheels went beside them. And when the keruḇim lifted their wings to mount up from the earth, the same wheels also did not turn from beside them.

<sup>17</sup> When they stood still, the wheels stood still, and when one was lifted up, the other lifted itself up, for the spirit of the living creature was in them.

<sup>18</sup> And the esteem of יהוה went from the threshold of the House and stood over the keruḇim.

<sup>19</sup> And the keruḇim lifted their wings and rose from the earth before my eyes. When they went out, the wheels were beside them. And it stood at the door of the east gate of the House of יהוה, and the esteem of the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl was above them.

<sup>20</sup> It was the living creature I saw under the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl by the River Keḇar, and I knew they were keruḇim.

<sup>21</sup> Each one had four faces and each one four wings, and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings.

<sup>22</sup> And the likeness of their faces was the same as the faces which I had seen by the River Keḇar, their appearances and themselves. Each one went straight forward.
