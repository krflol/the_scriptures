<sup>1</sup> In the twenty-fifth year of our exile, at the beginning of the year, on the tenth of the month, in the fourteenth year after the city was smitten, on that same day the hand of יהוה came upon me and He brought me there.

<sup>2</sup> In visions of Elohim He brought me into the land of Yisra’ĕl and set me on a very high mountain, and upon it toward the south was as the structure of a city.

<sup>3</sup> So He brought me there, and look, a man whose appearance was like the appearance of bronze, and a line of flax and a measuring rod in his hand, and he stood in the gateway.

<sup>4</sup> And the man said to me, “Son of man, see with your eyes and hear with your ears, and set your heart on all that I am showing you, for you were brought here in order to show them to you. Declare to the house of Yisra’ĕl all that you are seeing.”

<sup>5</sup> And look: a wall all around the outside of the House, and in the man’s hand a measuring rod six cubits long, each being a cubit and a handbreadth. And he measured the width of the wall structure, one rod, and the height one rod.

<sup>6</sup> Then he came to the gate facing east. And he went up its stairs and measured the threshold of the gate, one rod wide, and the other threshold, one rod wide,

<sup>7</sup> and the little room one rod long and one rod wide, and between the little rooms a space of five cubits. And the threshold of the gate inwards from the porch of the gate was one rod.

<sup>8</sup> Then he measured the porch of the inside gate, one rod.

<sup>9</sup> And he measured the porch of the gate, eight cubits, and its posts two cubits. And the porch of the gate was on the inside.

<sup>10</sup> And the little rooms of the east gate three on one side and three on the other, all three of the same size. And posts were of the same size on this side and that side.

<sup>11</sup> And he measured the width of the entrance of the gate, ten cubits, and the length of the gate thirteen cubits.

<sup>12</sup> And the border in front of the little rooms, one cubit on this side and one cubit on that side. And the gate room was six cubits on this side and six cubits on that side.

<sup>13</sup> And he measured the gate from the roof of one little room to the roof of the other, the width was twenty-five cubits, door to door.

<sup>14</sup> And he measured the posts, sixty cubits high, even to the post of the courtyard all around the gate.

<sup>15</sup> And from the front of the entrance gate to the front of the porch of the inner gate was fifty cubits.

<sup>16</sup> And there were narrowed window frames in the little rooms and to their posts at the inside of the gate all around, and for the porches too. And there were windows all around on the inside. And on each post were palm trees.

<sup>17</sup> And he brought me into the outer courtyard, and look, rooms and a pavement made all around the courtyard, thirty rooms on the pavement.

<sup>18</sup> And the pavement was by the side of the gates, equal to the length of the gates – the lower pavement.

<sup>19</sup> And he measured the width from the front of the lower gate to the front of the inner courtyard on the outside, one hundred cubits toward the east and the north.

<sup>20</sup> And the gate of the outer courtyard facing north he measured its length and its width.

<sup>21</sup> And its little rooms, three on this side and three on that side, its posts and its porches, had the same measurements as the first gate, its length was fifty cubits and its width twenty-five cubits.

<sup>22</sup> And its windows and its porches, and its palm trees, had the same measurements as the gate facing east. And they went up to it by seven steps, and its porch was in front of it.

<sup>23</sup> And the gate of the inner courtyard was opposite the northern gate, and at the eastern gate. And he measured from gate to gate, one hundred cubits.

<sup>24</sup> And he took me toward the south, and look, a gate toward the south. And he measured its posts and porches according to these measurements.

<sup>25</sup> And windows were in it and in its porches all around like those windows, its length was fifty cubits and its width twenty-five cubits.

<sup>26</sup> And seven steps led up to it, and its porch was in front of them. And it had palm trees on its posts, one on this side and one on that side.

<sup>27</sup> And the inner courtyard had a gate toward the south. And he measured from gate to gate toward the south, one hundred cubits.

<sup>28</sup> And he brought me to the inner courtyard through the south gate, and he measured the southern gate according to these measurements.

<sup>29</sup> And its little rooms, and its posts, and its porches were according to these measurements. And windows were in it and in its porches all around – fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide.

<sup>30</sup> And there were porches all around, twenty-five cubits long and five cubits wide.

<sup>31</sup> And its porches were toward the outer courtyard, and palm trees were on its posts, and eight steps led up to it.

<sup>38</sup> And there was a room with its entrance by the posts of the gate, where they washed the burnt offering.

<sup>39</sup> And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side and two tables on that side, on which to slaughter the burnt offering, and the sin offering, and the guilt offering.

<sup>40</sup> And on the outer side, as one went up to the entrance of the north gate, were two tables. And on the other side of the porch of the gate were two tables.

<sup>41</sup> Four tables were on this side and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate, eight tables on which they slaughtered.

<sup>42</sup> And there were four tables of hewn stone for the burnt offering, one cubit and a half long, one cubit and a half wide, and one cubit high. On these they placed the instruments with which they slaughtered the burnt offering and the offering.

<sup>43</sup> And the double hooks, a handbreadth wide, were fastened all around. And on the tables was the flesh of the offerings.

<sup>44</sup> And on the outside of the inner gate were the rooms for the singers in the inner courtyard, one at the side of the north gate and facing south, and the other at the side of the south gate facing north.

<sup>45</sup> And he said to me, “This room facing south is for the priests who guard the duty of the House.

<sup>46</sup> “And the room facing north is for the priests who guard the duty of the altar, they are the sons of Tsaḏoq, from the sons of Lĕwi, who come near יהוה to serve Him.”

<sup>47</sup> And he measured the courtyard, one hundred cubits long and one hundred cubits wide, a square. And the altar was in front of the House.
