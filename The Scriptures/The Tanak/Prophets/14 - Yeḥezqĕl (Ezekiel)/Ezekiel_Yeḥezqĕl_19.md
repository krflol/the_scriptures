<sup>1</sup> “And take up a lamentation for the leaders of Yisra’ĕl,

<sup>2</sup> and you shall say, ‘What a lioness was your mother among the lions! She lay down among the lions, in the midst of the young lions she reared her cubs.

<sup>3</sup> ‘And she brought up one of her cubs, and he became a young lion. And he learned to tear the prey, he devoured men.

<sup>4</sup> ‘Then nations heard of him. He was caught in their pit, and they brought him with chains to the land of Mitsrayim.

<sup>5</sup> ‘When she saw, as she waited, that her expectancy was lost, she took another of her cubs and made him a young lion.

<sup>6</sup> ‘And he went about among the lions, and became a young lion. And he learned to tear the prey, he devoured men.

<sup>7</sup> ‘And he knew their widows, and laid waste their cities. And the land and all who filled it was stunned by the noise of his roaring.

<sup>8</sup> ‘Then nations set against him from the provinces on every side, and spread their net over him, he was caught in their pit.

<sup>9</sup> ‘And they put him in a cage in chains, and brought him to the sovereign of Baḇel. They brought him in nets, so his roar was no longer heard on the mountains of Yisra’ĕl.

<sup>10</sup> ‘Your mother was like a vine in your vineyard, planted by the waters, a bearer of fruit and branching, because of many waters.

<sup>11</sup> ‘And she had strong rods for sceptres of rulers. And her stature was exalted among the thick branches, and was seen in her height with the mass of its branches.

<sup>12</sup> ‘But she was uprooted in wrath, she was cast down to the ground, and the east wind dried her fruit. Her strong rods were broken and withered, fire consumed them.

<sup>13</sup> ‘And now she is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty land.

<sup>14</sup> ‘And fire went out from a rod of her branches. It devoured her fruit, so that she has no strong rod, a sceptre to rule.’ ” This is a lament, and it shall be a lament.
