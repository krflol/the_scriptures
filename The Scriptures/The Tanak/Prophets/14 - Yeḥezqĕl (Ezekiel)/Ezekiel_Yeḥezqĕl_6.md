<sup>1</sup> And the word of יהוה came to me, saying,

<sup>2</sup> “Son of man, set your face toward the mountains of Yisra’ĕl, and prophesy against them.

<sup>3</sup> “And you shall say, ‘O mountains of Yisra’ĕl, hear the word of the Master יהוה !’ Thus said the Master יהוה to the mountains, to the hills, to the ravines, and to the valleys, “Look, I Myself am bringing a sword against you, and I shall destroy your high places.

<sup>4</sup> “And your altars shall be ruined, your sun-pillars shall be broken in pieces. And I shall make your slain fall in front of your idols,

<sup>5</sup> and lay the corpses of the children of Yisra’ĕl in front of their idols, and scatter your bones all around your altars.

<sup>6</sup> “In all your dwelling places the cities shall be destroyed and the high places deserted, so that your altars are broken and bear their punishment. And your idols shall be smashed and made to cease, and your sun-pillars cut down, and your works blotted out.

<sup>7</sup> “And the slain shall fall in your midst, and you shall know that I am יהוה.

<sup>8</sup> “But I shall leave a remnant, in that some of you shall escape the sword among the gentiles, when you are scattered throughout the lands.

<sup>9</sup> “And those of you who escape shall remember Me among the gentiles where they have been taken captive, because I have been broken by their adulterous heart which has turned away from Me, and by their eyes which whored after their idols. And they shall loathe themselves for the evils which they have done in all their abominations.

<sup>10</sup> “And they shall know that I am יהוה, and not for naught have I spoken to do this evil to them.”

<sup>11</sup> ‘Thus said the Master יהוה, “Strike with your hand and stamp your feet, and say, ‘Alas, because of all the evil abominations of the house of Yisra’ĕl who shall fall by sword, by scarcity of food, and by pestilence!

<sup>12</sup> ‘He who is far off shall die by pestilence, he who is near fall by the sword, and he who is left over and is besieged die by scarcity of food. And I shall complete My wrath upon them.

<sup>13</sup> ‘And you shall know that I am יהוה, when their slain are among their idols all around their altars, on every high hill, on all the mountaintops, under every green tree, and under every thick oak, wherever they offered sweet incense to all their idols.

<sup>14</sup> ‘And I shall stretch out My hand against them and make the land a wasteland, even more waste than the wilderness toward Diḇlah, in all their dwelling places. And they shall know that I am יהוה.’ ” ’ ”
