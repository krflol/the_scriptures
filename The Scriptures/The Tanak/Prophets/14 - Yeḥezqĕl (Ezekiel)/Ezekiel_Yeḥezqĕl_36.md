<sup>1</sup> “And you, son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Yisra’ĕl, and you shall say, ‘O mountains of Yisra’ĕl, hear the word of יהוה !

<sup>2</sup> ‘Thus said the Master יהוה, “Because the enemy has said of you, ‘Aha! The heights of old have become our possession,’ ” ’

<sup>3</sup> therefore prophesy, and you shall say, ‘Thus said the Master יהוה, “Because they laid you waste and swallowed you up on every side, so that you became the possession of the rest of the gentiles, and you are taken up by the lips of talkers and slandered by the people,”

<sup>4</sup> therefore, O mountains of Yisra’ĕl, hear the word of the Master יהוה ! Thus said the Master יהוה to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys, and to the deserted ruins, and to the cities that have been forsaken, which became a prey and a mocking to the rest of the gentiles all around;

<sup>5</sup> therefore thus said the Master יהוה, “Have I not spoken in My burning jealousy against the rest of the gentiles and against all Eḏom, who gave My land to themselves as a possession, with all joy of heart, with scorn in their being, to drive it out for a prey?” ’

<sup>6</sup> “Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Yisra’ĕl, and you shall say to mountains, and to hills, to rivers, and to valleys, ‘Thus said the Master יהוה, “See, I have spoken in My jealousy and My wrath, because you have borne the shame of the gentiles.”

<sup>7</sup> ‘Therefore thus said the Master יהוה, “I have lifted My hand in an oath that the gentiles that are around you shall bear their own shame.

<sup>8</sup> “But you, O mountains of Yisra’ĕl, put forth your branches and bear your fruit to My people Yisra’ĕl, for they are about to come!

<sup>9</sup> “For look, I am for you, and I shall turn to you, and you shall be tilled and sown.

<sup>10</sup> “And I shall increase men upon you, all the house of Yisra’ĕl, all of it. And the cities shall be inhabited and the ruins rebuilt.

<sup>11</sup> “And I shall increase upon you man and beast, and they shall increase and bear young. And I shall make you inhabited as of old, and do better for you than at your beginnings. And you shall know that I am יהוה.

<sup>12</sup> “And I shall let men, My people Yisra’ĕl, walk upon you, and let them possess you, and you shall be their inheritance, and no longer let you add to their bereavement.”

<sup>13</sup> ‘Thus said the Master יהוה, “Because they say to you, ‘You devour men and have bereaved your nation,’

<sup>14</sup> therefore you shall no longer devour men, and no longer bereave your nation,” declares the Master יהוה.

<sup>15</sup> “And no longer shall I let you hear the insults of the gentiles. And the reproach of the peoples you shall bear no more, and no longer cause your nations to stumble,” declares the Master יהוה.’ ”

<sup>16</sup> And the word of יהוה came to me, saying,

<sup>17</sup> “Son of man, when the house of Yisra’ĕl dwelt in their own land, they defiled it by their own ways and deeds. To Me their way was like the uncleanness of a woman in her monthly period.

<sup>18</sup> “So I poured out My wrath on them for the blood they had shed on the land, and for their idols they defiled it.

<sup>19</sup> “And I scattered them among the gentiles, and they were dispersed throughout the lands. I have judged them according to their ways and their deeds.

<sup>20</sup> “And when they came to the gentiles, wherever they went, they profaned My set-apart Name for it was said of them, ‘These are the people of יהוה, and yet they have gone out of His land.’

<sup>21</sup> “But I had compassion on My set-apart Name, which the house of Yisra’ĕl had profaned among the gentiles wherever they went.

<sup>22</sup> “Therefore say to the house of Yisra’ĕl, ‘Thus said the Master יהוה, “I do not do this for your sake, O house of Yisra’ĕl, but for My set-apart Name’s sake, which you have profaned among the gentiles wherever you went.

<sup>23</sup> “And I shall set apart My great Name, which has been profaned among the gentiles, which you have profaned in their midst. And the gentiles shall know that I am יהוה,” declares the Master יהוה, “when I am set-apart in you before their eyes.

<sup>24</sup> “And I shall take you from among the gentiles, and I shall gather you out of all lands, and I shall bring you into your own land.

<sup>25</sup> “And I shall sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean – from all your filthiness and from all your idols I cleanse you.

<sup>26</sup> “And I shall give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you. And I shall take the heart of stone out of your flesh, and I shall give you a heart of flesh,

<sup>27</sup> and put My Spirit within you. And I shall cause you to walk in My laws and guard My right-rulings and shall do them.

<sup>28</sup> “And you shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers. And you shall be My people, and I shall be your Elohim.

<sup>29</sup> “And I shall save you from all your uncleannesses. And I shall call for the grain and increase it, and I shall bring no scarcity of food upon you.

<sup>30</sup> “And I shall increase the fruit of your trees and the increase of your fields, so that you need never again bear the reproach of scarcity of food among the gentiles.

<sup>31</sup> “And you shall remember your evil ways and your deeds that were not good. And you shall loathe yourselves in your own eyes, for your crookednesses and your abominations.

<sup>32</sup> “Not for your sake am I acting,” declares the Master יהוה, “let it be known to you. Be ashamed and blush for your ways, O house of Yisra’ĕl!”

<sup>33</sup> ‘Thus said the Master יהוה, “On the day that I cleanse you from all your crookednesses, I shall cause the cities to be inhabited, and the ruined places shall be rebuilt,

<sup>34</sup> and the land that was laid waste tilled instead of being a ruin before the eyes of all who pass by.

<sup>35</sup> “And they shall say, ‘This land that was laid waste has become like the garden of Ĕḏen. And the wasted, the deserted, and the destroyed cities are now walled and inhabited.’

<sup>36</sup> “Then the gentiles which are left all around you shall know that I, יהוה, have rebuilt the destroyed places and planted what was laid waste. I, יהוה, have spoken it, and I shall do it.”

<sup>37</sup> ‘Thus said the Master יהוה, “Once again I shall let the house of Yisra’ĕl inquire of Me to do for them: I shall increase their men like a flock.

<sup>38</sup> “As a set-apart flock, as the flock at Yerushalayim at her appointed times, so shall the wasted cities be filled with flocks of men. And they shall know that I am יהוה.” ’ ”

<sup>1</sup> “And you, son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Yisra’ĕl, and you shall say, ‘O mountains of Yisra’ĕl, hear the word of יהוה !
