<sup>1</sup> “And these are the names of the tribes: From the north end along the way to Ḥethlon at the entrance of Ḥamath, to Ḥatsar Ĕnan, the border of Damascus northward by the side of Ḥamath, from its east to its west side, Dan: one.

<sup>2</sup> “And by the border of Dan, from the east side to the west, Ashĕr: one.

<sup>3</sup> “And by the border of Ashĕr, from the east side to the west, Naphtali: one.

<sup>4</sup> “And by the border of Naphtali, from the east side to the west, Menashsheh: one.

<sup>5</sup> “And by the border of Menashsheh, from the east side to the west, Ephrayim: one.

<sup>6</sup> “And by the border of Ephrayim, from the east side to the west, Re’uḇĕn: one.

<sup>7</sup> “And by the border of Re’uḇĕn, from the east side to the west, Yehuḏah: one.

<sup>8</sup> “And by the border of Yehuḏah, from the east side to the west, is the contribution which you offer up, twenty-five thousand cubits in width, and in length the same as one of the portions, from the east side to the west, with the set-apart place in its midst.

<sup>9</sup> “The contribution that you offer up to יהוה is twenty-five thousand cubits in length and ten thousand in width.

<sup>10</sup> “And of these is the set-apart contribution for the priests: on the north twenty-five thousand cubits, and on the west ten thousand in width, and on the east ten thousand in width, and on the south twenty-five thousand in length. And the set-apart place of יהוה shall be in its midst –

<sup>11</sup> for the priests of the sons of Tsaḏoq, who are set-apart, who did guard My Charge, who did not go astray when the children of Yisra’ĕl went astray, as the Lĕwites went astray.

<sup>12</sup> “So this contribution shall be to them, from the contribution of the land, a most set-apart place by the border of the Lĕwites.

<sup>13</sup> “And alongside the border of the priests, the Lĕwites have twenty-five thousand cubits in length and ten thousand in width, its entire length is twenty-five thousand and its width ten thousand.

<sup>14</sup> “And they do not sell any of it, nor exchange it, nor transfer this best part of the land, for it is set-apart to יהוה.

<sup>15</sup> “And the five thousand cubits in width that is left, facing the twenty-five thousand, is for common use by the city, for dwellings and open land. And the city shall be in its midst.

<sup>16</sup> “And these are its measurements: the north side four thousand five hundred cubits, and the south side four thousand five hundred, and the east side four thousand five hundred, and the west side four thousand five hundred.

<sup>17</sup> “And the open land of the city shall be: to the north two hundred and fifty cubits, and to the south two hundred and fifty, and to the east two hundred and fifty, and to the west two hundred and fifty.

<sup>18</sup> “And the rest of the length, alongside the contribution of the set-apart portion, is ten thousand cubits to the east and ten thousand to the west. And it shall be alongside the contribution of the set-apart portion, and its increase shall be food for the workers of the city.

<sup>19</sup> “And the workers of the city, from all the tribes of Yisra’ĕl, shall till it.

<sup>20</sup> “The entire contribution is twenty-five thousand cubits by twenty-five thousand cubits, foursquare. You are to offer up the set-apart contribution with the possession of the city.

<sup>21</sup> “And the rest is for the prince, on one side and on the other of the set-apart contribution and of the possession of the city, facing the twenty-five thousand cubits of the set-apart contribution as far as the eastern border, and westward facing the twenty-five thousand as far as the western border, alongside the portions of the prince. And the set-apart contribution, and the set-apart place of the House shall be in its midst.

<sup>22</sup> “So the possession of the Lĕwites and the possession of the city are in the midst of what belongs to the prince – between the border of Yehuḏah and the border of Binyamin, it belongs to the prince.

<sup>23</sup> “As for the rest of the tribes, from the east side to the west side, Binyamin: one.

<sup>24</sup> “And by the border of Binyamin, from the east side to the west side, Shim‛on: one.

<sup>25</sup> “And by the border of Shim‛on, from the east side to the west side, Yissasḵar: one.

<sup>26</sup> “And by the border of Yissasḵar, from the east side to the west side, Zeḇulun: one.

<sup>27</sup> “And by the border of Zeḇulun, from the east side to the west side, Gaḏ: one.

<sup>28</sup> “And by the border of Gaḏ, on the south side toward the South, the border shall be from Tamar to the waters of Meriḇah by Qaḏĕsh, along the Wadi to the Great Sea.

<sup>29</sup> “This is the land which you divide by lot as an inheritance among the tribes of Yisra’ĕl, and these are their portions,” declares the Master יהוה.

<sup>30</sup> “And these are the exits of the city, the gates of the city according to the names of the tribes of Yisra’ĕl: On the north side, measuring four thousand five hundred cubits,

<sup>31</sup> the three gates northward: one gate for Re’uḇĕn, one gate for Yehuḏah, one gate for Lĕwi.

<sup>32</sup> “And on the east side, four thousand five hundred cubits, three gates: one gate for Yosĕph, one gate for Binyamin, one gate for Dan.

<sup>33</sup> “And on the south side, measuring four thousand five hundred cubits, three gates: one gate for Shim‛on, one gate for Yissasḵar, one gate for Zeḇulun.

<sup>34</sup> “And on the west side, four thousand five hundred cubits with their three gates: one gate for Gaḏ, one gate for Ashĕr, one gate for Naphtali.

<sup>35</sup> “All around: eighteen thousand cubits. And the name of the city from that day is: יהוה is there!”
