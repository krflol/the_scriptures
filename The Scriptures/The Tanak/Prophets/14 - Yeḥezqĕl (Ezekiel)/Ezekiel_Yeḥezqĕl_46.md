<sup>1</sup> ‘Thus said the Master יהוה, “The gate of the inner courtyard facing east is shut the six days of work, but on the Sabbath it is opened, and on the day of the New Moon it is opened.

<sup>2</sup> “And the prince shall enter by way of the porch of that gate from the outside, and he shall stand by the post. And the priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings. And he shall bow himself at the threshold of the gate, and shall go out, but the gate is not shut until evening.

<sup>3</sup> “And the people of the land shall also bow themselves at the entrance to this gate before יהוה, on the Sabbaths and on the New Moons.

<sup>4</sup> “And the burnt offering which the prince brings to יהוה on the Sabbath day is six lambs, perfect ones, and a ram, a perfect one.

<sup>5</sup> “And the grain offering is one ĕphah for a ram, and the grain offering for the lambs, a gift of his hand, and a hin of oil for an ĕphah.

<sup>6</sup> “And on the day of the New Moon: a young bull, a perfect one, six lambs, and a ram, they should be perfect.

<sup>7</sup> “And he prepares a grain offering of an ĕphah for a bull, and an ĕphah for a ram, and for the lambs as his hand attains, and a hin of oil for an ĕphah.

<sup>8</sup> “And when the prince enters, he comes in by way of the porch of that gate, and goes out the same way.

<sup>9</sup> “And when the people of the land enter before יהוה at the appointed times, whoever shall enter by way of the north gate to bow himself, goes out by way of the south gate. And whoever enters by way of the south gate, goes out by way of the north gate, he shall not return by way of the gate through which he came, but goes out through the opposite one.

<sup>10</sup> “And the prince is to be in their midst, entering when they enter, and going out when they go out.

<sup>11</sup> “And in the festivals and in the appointed times the grain offering is an ĕphah for a bull, and an ĕphah for a ram, and for lambs the gift of his hand, and a hin of oil for an ĕphah.

<sup>12</sup> “And when the prince makes a spontaneous burnt offering or spontaneous peace offerings to יהוה, the gate facing east shall be opened for him. And he shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings as he did on the Sabbath day. And he shall go out, and after he goes out the gate shall be shut.

<sup>13</sup> “And make a daily burnt offering to יהוה of a lamb a year old, a perfect one, preparing it morning by morning.

<sup>14</sup> “And prepare a grain offering with it morning by morning, a sixth of an ĕphah, and a third of a hin of oil to moisten the fine flour, a grain offering to יהוה – continual everlasting laws.

<sup>15</sup> “And prepare the lamb, and the grain offering, and the oil, morning by morning, a continual burnt offering.”

<sup>16</sup> ‘Thus said the Master יהוה, “When the prince gives a gift of some of his inheritance to any of his sons, it belongs to his sons, it is their possession by inheritance.

<sup>17</sup> “And when he gives a gift of some of his inheritance to one of his servants, then it shall be his till the year of release, then it shall return to the prince. Only the inheritance of his sons is theirs.

<sup>18</sup> “And the prince does not take any of the people’s inheritance by evicting them from their possession. He is to give his sons their inheritance from his own possession, so that none of My people are separated from his possession.” ’ ”

<sup>19</sup> And he brought me through the entrance, which was at the side of the gate, into the set-apart rooms of the priests facing north. And look, there was a place at the extreme rear toward the west.

<sup>20</sup> And he said to me, “This is the place where the priests cook the guilt offering and the sin offering, where they bake the grain offering, so as not to bring them out into the outer courtyard to set the people apart.”

<sup>21</sup> And he brought me out into the outer courtyard and made me pass along to the four corners of the courtyard. And look, in every corner of the courtyard was another courtyard.

<sup>22</sup> In the four corners of the courtyard were courtyards covered over, forty cubits long and thirty wide, these four corners having one measure,

<sup>23</sup> and a row of building stones all around in them, all around the four of them, and places for fire were made under the rows, all around.

<sup>24</sup> And he said to me, “These are the kitchens where the attendants of the House cook the slaughterings of the people.”
