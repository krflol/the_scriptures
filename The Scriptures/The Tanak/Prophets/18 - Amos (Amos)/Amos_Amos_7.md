<sup>1</sup> This is what the Master יהוה showed me, and see, He was forming locust swarms at the beginning of the late crop. And see, it was the late crop after the mowings of the sovereign.

<sup>2</sup> And it came to be, when they had finished eating the grass of the land, that I said, “O Master יהוה, forgive, I pray! How does Ya‛aqoḇ survive, for he is small?”

<sup>3</sup> יהוה relented concerning this. “It shall not be,” said יהוה.

<sup>4</sup> This is what the Master יהוה showed me, and see, the Master יהוה was calling to contend by fire, and it consumed the great deep and did consume the portion,

<sup>5</sup> and I said, “O Master יהוה, please stop! How does Ya‛aqoḇ survive, for he is small?”

<sup>6</sup> יהוה relented concerning this. “This shall not be either,” said the Master יהוה.

<sup>7</sup> This is what He showed me, and see, יהוה stood on a wall made with a plumb-line, with a plumb-line in His hand,

<sup>8</sup> and יהוה said to me, “Amos, what do you see?” And I said, “A plumb-line.” And יהוה said, “See, I am setting a plumb-line in the midst of My people Yisra’ĕl, no longer do I pardon them.

<sup>9</sup> “And the high places of Yitsḥaq shall be laid waste, and the set-apart places of Yisra’ĕl shall be destroyed. And I shall rise with the sword against the house of Yaroḇ‛am.”

<sup>10</sup> Then Amatsyah the priest of Bĕyth Ĕl sent to Yaroḇ‛am sovereign of Yisra’ĕl, saying, “Amos has conspired against you in the midst of the house of Yisra’ĕl. The land is not able to endure all his words,

<sup>11</sup> for this is what Amos said, ‘Yaroḇ‛am shall die by the sword, and Yisra’ĕl certainly be exiled from their own land.’ ”

<sup>12</sup> And Amatsyah said to Amos, “Go, you seer! Flee to the land of Yehuḏah, and eat bread and prophesy there,

<sup>13</sup> but do not prophesy any more at Bĕyth Ĕl, for it is the sovereign’s set-apart place and it is the house of the reign.”

<sup>14</sup> And Amos answered and said to Amatsyah, “I am not a prophet, nor am I a son of a prophet, for I am a herdsman and a grower of sycamore figs.

<sup>15</sup> “But יהוה took me from behind the flock, and יהוה said to me, ‘Go, prophesy to My people Yisra’ĕl.’

<sup>16</sup> “And now, hear the word of יהוה. You are saying, ‘Do not prophesy against Yisra’ĕl, and do not drop words against the house of Yitsḥaq.’

<sup>17</sup> “Therefore thus said יהוה, ‘Your wife shall become a whore in the city, and your sons and daughters fall by the sword, and your land be divided by a measuring line, and you die in a defiled land, and Yisra’ĕl shall certainly be exiled from its land.’ ”

<sup>1</sup> This is what the Master יהוה showed me, and see, He was forming locust swarms at the beginning of the late crop. And see, it was the late crop after the mowings of the sovereign.
