<sup>1</sup> Thus said יהוה, “For three transgressions of Mo’aḇ, and for four, I do not turn it back, because he burned the bones of the sovereign of Eḏom to lime.

<sup>2</sup> “But I shall send fire upon Mo’aḇ, and it shall consume the palaces of Qeriyoth. And Mo’aḇ shall die amid uproar, with a cry and with the sound of a ram’s horn.

<sup>3</sup> “And I shall cut off the judge from its midst, and slay all its heads with him,” said יהוה.

<sup>4</sup> Thus said יהוה, “For three transgressions of Yehuḏah, and for four, I do not turn it back, because they have rejected the Torah of יהוה, and did not guard His laws. And their lies after which their fathers walked lead them astray.

<sup>5</sup> “But I shall send fire upon Yehuḏah, and it shall consume the palaces of Yerushalayim.”

<sup>6</sup> Thus said יהוה, “For three transgressions of Yisra’ĕl, and for four, I do not turn it back, because they sell the righteous for silver, and the poor for a pair of sandals,

<sup>7</sup> who crush the head of the poor ones in the dust of the earth, and turn aside the way of the meek. And a man and his father go in to the same girl, to defile My set-apart Name.

<sup>8</sup> “And they lie down by every altar on garments taken in pledge, and in the house of their mighty one they drink the wine of those who have been fined.

<sup>9</sup> “Yet I destroyed the Amorite before them, whose height was like the height of the cedars. And he was as strong as the oaks, yet I destroyed his fruit from above and his roots from beneath.

<sup>10</sup> “And I brought you up from the land of Mitsrayim, and led you forty years through the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite.

<sup>11</sup> “And I raised up some of your sons as prophets, and some of your young men as Nazirites. Not so? O you children of Yisra’ĕl?” declares יהוה.

<sup>12</sup> “But you made the Nazirites drink wine, and commanded the prophets saying, ‘Do not prophesy!’

<sup>13</sup> “See, I am weighed down by you, as a wagon is weighed down when filled with sheaves.

<sup>14</sup> “And a place to flee shall perish from the swift, and the strong not strengthen his power, and the mighty not save his life,

<sup>15</sup> and he who handles the bow not stand, and the swift of foot not save, nor he who rides a horse save his life,

<sup>16</sup> and the bravest among the mighty flee naked, in that day,” declares יהוה.
