<sup>1</sup> I saw יהוה standing by the altar, and He said, “Smite the column head, so that the thresholds shake, and break them off by the head, all of them. And the last of them I slay with the sword. Not one of them fleeing gets away, and not one fugitive of them escapes.

<sup>2</sup> “If they dig into the grave, from there my hand does take them; and if they climb up to the heavens, from there I bring them down.

<sup>3</sup> “And if they hide themselves on top of Karmel, from there I shall search, and take them. And if they hide from before My eyes at the bottom of the sea, from there I shall command the serpent, and it shall bite them.

<sup>4</sup> “And if they go into captivity before their enemies, from there I shall command the sword, and it shall slay them. And I shall set My eyes on them for evil and not for good.”

<sup>5</sup> And the Master יהוה of hosts is He who touches the earth so that it melts, and all who dwell in it mourn, and all of it come up like the River, and subside like the River of Mitsrayim –

<sup>6</sup> who is building His upper room in the heavens, and has founded His firmament on the earth, who is calling for the waters of the sea, and pours them out on the face of the earth – יהוה is His Name.

<sup>7</sup> “Are you not like the people of Kush to Me, O children of Yisra’ĕl?” declares יהוה. “Did I not bring up Yisra’ĕl from the land of Mitsrayim, and the Philistines from Kaphtor, and Aram from Qir?

<sup>8</sup> “Look, the eyes of the Master יהוה are on the sinful reign, and I shall destroy it from the face of the earth, except that, I do not completely destroy the house of Ya‛aqoḇ,” declares יהוה.

<sup>9</sup> “For look, I am commanding, and I shall sift the house of Yisra’ĕl among all the gentiles, as one sifts with a sieve, yet not a grain falls to the ground.

<sup>10</sup> “All the sinners of My people are going to die by the sword, those who are saying, ‘Evil does not overtake us nor meet us.’

<sup>11</sup> “In that day I shall raise up the booth of Dawiḏ which has fallen down. And I shall repair its breaches and raise up its ruins. And I shall build it as in the days of old,

<sup>12</sup> so that they possess the remnant of Eḏom, and all the gentiles on whom My Name is called,” declares יהוה who does this.

<sup>13</sup> “Look, the days are coming,” declares יהוה, “that the ploughman shall overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him who sows seed. And the mountains shall drip new wine, and all the hills melt.

<sup>14</sup> “And I shall turn back the captivity of My people Yisra’ĕl. And they shall build the waste cities and inhabit them. And they shall plant vineyards and drink wine from them, and shall make gardens and eat their fruit.

<sup>15</sup> “And I shall plant them on their own soil, and not uproot them any more from their own soil I have given them,” said יהוה your Elohim!
