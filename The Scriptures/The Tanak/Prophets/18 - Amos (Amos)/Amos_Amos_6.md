<sup>1</sup> Woe to those at ease in Tsiyon, and those trusting in Mount Shomeron, the distinguished ones among the chief of the nations, to whom the house of Yisra’ĕl comes!

<sup>2</sup> Pass over to Kalneh and see, and from there go to Ḥamath the great. Then go down to Gath of the Philistines. Are you better than these reigns, or is their border greater than your border?

<sup>3</sup> You who are putting off the day of evil, yet bring near the seat of violence,

<sup>4</sup> who are lying on beds of ivory, and are stretched out on your couches, and are eating lambs from the flock and calves from the midst of the stall,

<sup>5</sup> who are singing to the sound of the harp, having composed songs for themselves like Dawiḏ,

<sup>6</sup> who are drinking wine from bowls, and anoint with the finest ointments, yet they have not been pained over the breach of Yosĕph!

<sup>7</sup> Therefore they shall now go into exile, with the first of the exiles, and the feasting of the stretched-out ones shall cease!

<sup>8</sup> The Master יהוה has sworn by Himself, יהוה Elohim of hosts declares, “I am loathing the pride of Ya‛aqoḇ, and I have hated his palaces. Therefore I shall deliver up the city and all that is in it.”

<sup>9</sup> And it shall be, that if ten men remain in one house, they shall die.

<sup>10</sup> And if a relative, or his undertaker, brings the remains out of the house, he shall say to one inside the house, “Is anyone with you?” and he says, “No,” then he shall say, “Hush!” For we have not remembered the Name of יהוה !

<sup>11</sup> For look, יהוה is commanding, and He shall smite the great house with breaches, and the little house with clefts.

<sup>12</sup> Do horses run on a rock? Does one plough it with oxen? For you have turned right-ruling into poison, and the fruit of righteousness into wormwood,

<sup>13</sup> you who are rejoicing over a matter of naught, who say, “Have we not taken horns for ourselves by our own strength?”

<sup>14</sup> “For look, I am raising up a nation against you, O house of Yisra’ĕl,” declares יהוה Elohim of hosts, “and they shall oppress you from the entrance of Ḥamath to the wadi Araḇah.”
