<sup>1</sup> Hear this word, you cows of Bashan, who are on the mountain of Shomeron, who are oppressing the poor, who are crushing the needy, who are saying to their masters, “Bring wine, let us drink!”

<sup>2</sup> The Master יהוה has sworn by His set-apartness, “See, days are coming upon you when He shall take you away with hooks, and your descendants with fish-hooks,

<sup>3</sup> and let you go out at the breaches, each woman before her, and you shall be cast out toward Harmon,” declares יהוה.

<sup>4</sup> “Come to Bĕyth Ĕl and transgress, to Gilgal, increase transgression. And bring your slaughterings every morning, your tithes every three days.

<sup>5</sup> “And burn an offering of thanksgiving with leaven, proclaim voluntary offerings, loudly. For you have loved this, you children of Yisra’ĕl!” declares the Master יהוה.

<sup>6</sup> “And I also gave you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and lack of bread in all your places. But you did not turn back to Me,” declares יהוה.

<sup>7</sup> “And I also withheld rain from you, three months before the harvest. Then I would send rain on one city, and on another city I would not send rain. One part was rained upon, and where it did not rain the part would dry up.

<sup>8</sup> “Then two or three cities would wander to another city to drink water, but they were not satisfied. But you did not turn back to Me,” declares יהוה.

<sup>9</sup> “I have smitten you with blight and with mildew. The creeping locust devoured your many gardens, and your vineyards, and your fig trees, and your olive trees. But you did not turn back to Me,” declares יהוה.

<sup>10</sup> “I have sent among you a plague in the way of Mitsrayim. I have slain your young men with a sword, along with your captured horses. And I made the stench of your camps come up into your nostrils. But you did not turn back to Me,” declares יהוה.

<sup>11</sup> “I have overthrown some of you, as Elohim overthrew Seḏom and Amorah, and you were like a burning stick plucked from the burning. But you did not turn back to Me,” declares יהוה.

<sup>12</sup> “Therefore I am doing this to you, O Yisra’ĕl. And because I do this to you, prepare to meet your Elohim, O Yisra’ĕl!”

<sup>13</sup> For look, He who forms mountains, and creates the wind, and who declares to man what His thought is, and makes the morning darkness, and who treads the high places of the earth, יהוה Elohim of hosts is His Name.
