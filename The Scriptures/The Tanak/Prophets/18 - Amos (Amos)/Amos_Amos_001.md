<sup>1</sup> The words of Amos, who was among the herdsmen of Teqowa, which he saw concerning Yisra’ĕl in the days of Uzziyah sovereign of Yehuḏah, and in the days of Yaroḇ‛am son of Yo’ash, sovereign of Yisra’ĕl, two years before the earthquake.

<sup>2</sup> And he said, “ יהוה roars from Tsiyon, and gives forth His voice from Yerushalayim. And the pastures of the shepherds shall mourn, and the top of Karmel shall wither.”

<sup>3</sup> Thus said יהוה, “For three transgressions of Damascus, and for four, I do not turn it back, because they threshed Gil‛aḏ with threshing implements of iron.

<sup>4</sup> “But I shall send fire upon the house of Ḥaza’ĕl, and it shall consume the palaces of Ben-Haḏaḏ.

<sup>5</sup> “And I shall break the bar of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitant from the Valley of Awen, and the one who holds the sceptre from Bĕyth Ĕḏen. And the people of Aram shall go exiled to Qir,” said יהוה.

<sup>6</sup> Thus said יהוה, “For three transgressions of Azzah, and for four, I do not turn it back, because they took into exile an entire exile, to surrender it to Eḏom.

<sup>7</sup> “But I shall send fire upon the wall of Azzah, and it shall consume its palaces.

<sup>8</sup> “And I shall cut off the inhabitant from Ashdoḏ, and the one who holds the sceptre from Ashqelon. And I shall turn My hand against Eqron, and the remnant of the Philistines shall perish,” said the Master יהוה.

<sup>9</sup> Thus said יהוה, “For three transgressions of Tsor, and for four, I do not turn it back, because they surrendered an entire exile to Eḏom, and did not remember the brotherly covenant.

<sup>10</sup> “But I shall send fire upon the wall of Tsor, and it shall consume its palaces.”

<sup>11</sup> Thus said יהוה, “For three transgressions of Eḏom, and for four, I do not turn it back, because he pursued his brother with the sword, and cast off all compassion. And his displeasure tore incessantly, and he kept his wrath forever.

<sup>12</sup> “But I shall send fire upon Tĕman, and it shall consume the palaces of Botsrah.”

<sup>13</sup> Thus said יהוה, “For three transgressions of the children of Ammon, and for four, I do not turn it back, because they ripped open the pregnant women in Gil‛aḏ, to enlarge their border.

<sup>14</sup> “So I shall kindle a fire upon the wall of Rabbah, and it shall consume its palaces, with a shout in the day of battle, with a storm in the day of the whirlwind.

<sup>15</sup> “And their sovereign shall go into exile, he and his heads together,” said יהוה.
