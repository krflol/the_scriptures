<sup>1</sup> And in the latter days it shall be that the mountain of the House of יהוה is established on the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills. And peoples shall flow to it.

<sup>2</sup> And many nations shall come and say, “Come, and let us go up to the mountain of יהוה, to the House of the Elohim of Ya‛aqoḇ, and let Him teach us His ways, and let us walk in His paths. For out of Tsiyon comes forth the Torah, and the word of יהוה from Yerushalayim.”

<sup>3</sup> And He shall judge among many peoples, and reprove strong nations afar off. They shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into pruning hooks – nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither teach battle any more.

<sup>4</sup> But each one shall sit under his vine and under his fig tree, with no one to make them afraid, for the mouth of יהוה of hosts has spoken.

<sup>5</sup> For all the peoples walk, each one in the name of his mighty one, but we walk in the Name of יהוה our Elohim forever and ever.

<sup>6</sup> “In that day,” declares יהוה, “I gather the lame, and I bring together the outcast and those whom I have afflicted.

<sup>7</sup> “And I shall make the lame a remnant, and the outcast a strong nation. And יהוה shall reign over them in Mount Tsiyon, from now on and forever.

<sup>8</sup> “And you, O tower of the flock, stronghold of the daughter of Tsiyon, it shall come to you, the former rule shall come, the reign of the daughter of Yerushalayim.”

<sup>9</sup> Now why do you cry aloud? Is there no sovereign in you? Has your counsellor perished? For pain has gripped you like a woman in labour.

<sup>10</sup> Be in pain, and deliver, O daughter of Tsiyon, like a woman in labour. For now you are to leave the city, and you shall dwell in the field. And you shall go to Baḇel, there you shall be delivered, there יהוה shall redeem you from the hand of your enemies.

<sup>11</sup> And now, many gentiles shall be gathered against you, who are saying, “Let her be defiled, and let our eyes look upon Tsiyon!”

<sup>12</sup> But they do not know the thoughts of יהוה, nor do they understand His counsel. For He has gathered them like sheaves to the threshing-floor.

<sup>13</sup> “Arise and thresh, O daughter of Tsiyon, for I make your horn iron and your hooves bronze. And you shall beat many peoples into pieces, and I shall seclude their gain to יהוה, and their wealth to the Master of all the earth.”
