<sup>1</sup> Hear now what יהוה is saying, “Arise, strive with the mountains, and let the hills hear your voice.

<sup>2</sup> “Hear, O you mountains, the controversy of יהוה, and you everlasting foundations of the earth! For יהוה has a controversy with His people and He shall reprove Yisra’ĕl.

<sup>3</sup> “My people, what have I done to you? And how have I wearied you? Answer Me,

<sup>4</sup> for I brought you up from the land of Mitsrayim, and I ransomed you from the house of bondage. And I sent Mosheh, Aharon, and Miryam before you.

<sup>5</sup> “My people, remember, please, what Balaq sovereign of Mo’aḇ counselled, and what Bil‛am son of Be‛or answered him, from Shittim to Gilgal, in order to know the righteousness of יהוה.”

<sup>6</sup> With what shall I come before יהוה, bow myself before the high Elohim? Shall I come before Him with burnt offerings, with calves a year old?

<sup>7</sup> Is יהוה pleased with thousands of rams or ten thousand rivers of oil? Shall I give my first-born for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my being?

<sup>8</sup> He has declared to you, O man, what is good. And what does יהוה require of you but to do right, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your Elohim?

<sup>9</sup> The voice of יהוה cries to the city – and let sound wisdom see Your Name! “Hear the Rod and Him who appointed it!

<sup>10</sup> “Are there still treasures of wrongness in the house of the wrong, and the short measure that is an abomination?”

<sup>11</sup> Would I be innocent with wrong scales, and with a bag of false weights?

<sup>12</sup> “For her rich men are filled with cruel unrighteousness, and her inhabitants have spoken falsehood, and their tongue is deceit in their mouth.

<sup>13</sup> “So I also, I shall smite you with a grievous wound, to lay you waste because of your sins:

<sup>14</sup> “You shall eat but not be satisfied, and your inside be empty. And you shall store up but not save, and what you save I shall give to the sword.

<sup>15</sup> “You shall sow but not reap, you shall tread the olives but not anoint yourselves with oil, and make sweet wine but not drink wine.

<sup>16</sup> “For the laws of Omri are strictly observed, and all the works of the house of Aḥab, and you walk in their counsels. Therefore I give you for a ruin, and your inhabitants for a hissing, and let you bear the reproach of My people.”
