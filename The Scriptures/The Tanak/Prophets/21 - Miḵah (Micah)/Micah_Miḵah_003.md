<sup>1</sup> Then I said, “Hear now, O heads of Ya‛aqoḇ, and you rulers of the house of Yisra’ĕl: Should you not know right-ruling,

<sup>2</sup> you who are hating good and loving evil, tearing away the skin from My people, and the flesh from their bones,

<sup>3</sup> and who have eaten the flesh of My people, and stripped off their skin, and have broken their bones, and have cut it up as into a pot, like flesh in the cooking pot?”

<sup>4</sup> Therefore, when they cry to יהוה He does not answer them, and hides His face from them at that time, as they have made their deeds evil.

<sup>5</sup> Thus said יהוה concerning the prophets who lead my people astray, who are biting with their teeth and have called out, “Peace!” They even set apart a battle against him who does not give for their mouths.

<sup>6</sup> Therefore it shall be night to you without vision, and darkness to you without divination. The sun shall go down on the prophets, and the day shall be dark for them.

<sup>7</sup> And the seers shall be ashamed, and the diviners embarrassed. And they shall all cover their lips, for there is no answer, O Elohim.

<sup>8</sup> But truly I am filled with power, with the Spirit of יהוה, and with right-ruling and with might, to declare to Ya‛aqoḇ his transgression and to Yisra’ĕl his sin.

<sup>9</sup> Hear this, please, you heads of the house of Ya‛aqoḇ and you rulers of the house of Yisra’ĕl, who despise right-ruling and distort all that is straight,

<sup>10</sup> those building up Tsiyon with bloodshed and Yerushalayim with unrighteousness.

<sup>11</sup> Her heads judge for a bribe, her priests teach for pay, and her prophets divine for a price. Yet they lean on יהוה, and say, “Is not יהוה in our midst? Evil does not come upon us.”

<sup>12</sup> Therefore, because of you, Tsiyon is ploughed like a field, and Yerushalayim becomes heaps, and the mountain of the House like a wooded height.
