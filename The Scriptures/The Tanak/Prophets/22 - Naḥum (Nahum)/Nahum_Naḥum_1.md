<sup>1</sup> The message concerning Ninewĕh. The book of the vision of Naḥum the Elqoshite.

<sup>2</sup> יהוה is a jealous and revenging Ĕl, יהוה is a revenger and a possessor of wrath. יהוה takes vengeance on His adversaries, and He watches for His enemies.

<sup>3</sup> יהוה is patient and great in power, but by no means leaves unpunished. יהוה has His way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of His feet.

<sup>4</sup> He is rebuking the sea and dries it up. And all the floods He has made dry, Bashan and Karmel are withering, and the flower of Leḇanon is languishing.

<sup>5</sup> Mountains have shaken before Him, and the hills have melted. And the earth is lifted up at His presence, and the world and all who dwell in it.

<sup>6</sup> Who does stand before His rage? And who rises up in the heat of His displeasure? His wrath is poured out like fire, and the rocks have been broken by Him.

<sup>7</sup> יהוה is good, as a stronghold in the day of distress. And He knows those who take refuge in Him.

<sup>8</sup> But with an overwhelming flood He makes a complete end of the place of Ninewĕh, and darkness does pursue His enemies.

<sup>9</sup> What do you plot against יהוה ? He makes a complete end of it. Distress does not rise up a second time.

<sup>10</sup> Though they are as entangled thorns, and as drunkards with their drink, they shall be consumed like stubble thoroughly dried.

<sup>11</sup> From you came forth one who plots evil against יהוה, a counsellor of Beliya‛al.

<sup>12</sup> Thus said יהוה, “Though they are strong and many, even so, they shall be cut off and pass away. Though I have afflicted you, I afflict you no more.

<sup>13</sup> “So now I break his yoke from you, and tear off your shackles.”

<sup>14</sup> And יהוה has commanded concerning you, “Your name shall no longer be sown. From the house of your mighty ones I shall cut off the carved image and the moulded image. I shall appoint your grave, for you have been of no account.”

<sup>15</sup> See, on the mountains the feet of him who brings good news, who proclaims peace! O Yehuḏah, observe your festivals, perform your vows. For Beliya‛al shall no more pass through you. He has been cut off completely.
