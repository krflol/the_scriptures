<sup>1</sup> In the first year of Dareyawesh the son of Aḥashwĕrosh, of the seed of the Medes, who was set up as sovereign over the reign of the Chaldeans –

<sup>2</sup> in the first year of his reign I, Dani’ĕl, observed from the Scriptures the number of the years, according to the word of יהוה given to Yirmeyah the prophet, for the completion of the wastes of Yerushalayim would be seventy years.

<sup>3</sup> So I set my face toward יהוה the Elohim to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes.

<sup>4</sup> And I prayed to יהוה my Elohim, and made confession, and said, “O יהוה, great and awesome Ĕl, guarding the covenant and the kindness to those who love Him, and to those who guard His commands.

<sup>5</sup> “We have sinned and did crookedness, and did wrong and rebelled, to turn aside from Your commands and from Your right-rulings.

<sup>6</sup> “And we have not listened to Your servants the prophets, who spoke in Your Name to our sovereigns, our heads, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.

<sup>7</sup> “O יהוה, to You is the righteousness, and to us the shame of face, as it is this day – to the men of Yehuḏah, to the inhabitants of Yerushalayim and all Yisra’ĕl, those near and those far off in all the lands to which You have driven them, because of their trespass which they have trespassed against You.

<sup>8</sup> “O Master, to us is the shame of face, to our sovereigns, to our heads, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against You.

<sup>9</sup> “To יהוה our Elohim are the compassions and forgivenesses, for we have rebelled against Him.

<sup>10</sup> “And we have not obeyed the voice of יהוה our Elohim, to walk in His Torot, which He set before us through His servants the prophets.

<sup>11</sup> “And all Yisra’ĕl have transgressed Your Torah, and turned aside, so as not to obey Your voice. So the curse and the oath written in the Torah of Mosheh the servant of Elohim have been poured out on us, for we have sinned against Him.

<sup>12</sup> “And He has confirmed His words, which He spoke against us and against our rulers who judged us, by bringing upon us great evil. For under all the heavens there has not been done like what was done to Yerushalayim.

<sup>13</sup> “As it is written in the Torah of Mosheh, all this evil has come upon us, and we have not entreated the face of יהוה our Elohim, to turn back from our crookednesses, and to study Your truth.

<sup>14</sup> “Hence יהוה has watched over the evil and has brought it upon us. For יהוה our Elohim is righteous in all the works which He has done, but we have not obeyed His voice.

<sup>15</sup> “And now, O יהוה our Elohim, who brought Your people out of the land of Mitsrayim with a strong hand, and made Yourself a Name, as it is this day – we have sinned, we have done wrong!

<sup>16</sup> “O יהוה, according to all Your righteousness, I pray, let Your displeasure and Your wrath be turned away from Your city Yerushalayim, Your set-apart mountain. For, because of our sins, and because of the crookednesses of our fathers, Yerushalayim and Your people have become a reproach to all those around us.

<sup>17</sup> “And now, our Elohim, hear the prayer of Your servant, and his supplications, and for the sake of יהוה cause Your face to shine on Your set-apart place, which is laid waste.

<sup>18</sup> “O my Elohim, incline Your ear and hear. Open Your eyes and see our wastes, and the city which is called by Your Name. For we do not present our supplications before You because of our righteous deeds, but because of Your great compassions.

<sup>19</sup> “O יהוה, hear! O יהוה, forgive! O יהוה, listen and act! Do not delay for Your own sake, my Elohim, for Your city and Your people are called by Your Name.”

<sup>20</sup> And while I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Yisra’ĕl, and presenting my supplication before יהוה my Elohim for the set-apart mountain of my Elohim,

<sup>21</sup> while I was still speaking in prayer, the man Gaḇri’ĕl, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, came close to me, in swift flight about the time of the evening offering.

<sup>22</sup> And he made me understand, and talked with me, and said, “O Dani’ĕl, I have now come forth to make you wise concerning understanding.

<sup>23</sup> “At the beginning of your supplications a word went out, and I have come to make it known, for you are greatly appreciated. So consider the word and understand the vision:

<sup>24</sup> “Seventy weeks are decreed for your people and for your set-apart city, to put an end to the transgression, and to seal up sins, and to cover crookedness, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up vision and prophet, and to anoint the Most Set-apart.

<sup>25</sup> “Know, then, and understand: from the going forth of the command to restore and build Yerushalayim until Messiah the Prince is seven weeks and sixty-two weeks. It shall be built again, with streets and a trench, but in times of affliction.

<sup>26</sup> “And after the sixty-two weeks Messiah shall be cut off and have naught. And the people of a coming prince shall destroy the city and the set-apart place. And the end of it is with a flood. And wastes are decreed, and fighting until the end.

<sup>27</sup> “And he shall confirm a covenant with many for one week. And in the middle of the week he shall put an end to slaughtering and meal offering. And on the wing of abominations he shall lay waste, even until the complete end and that which is decreed is poured out on the one who lays waste.”
