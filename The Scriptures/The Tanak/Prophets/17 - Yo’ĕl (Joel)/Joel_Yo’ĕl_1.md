<sup>1</sup> The word of יהוה that came to Yo’ĕl son of Pethu’ĕl.

<sup>2</sup> Hear this, you elders, and give ear, all you inhabitants of the land! Has this ever been in your days, or even in the days of your fathers?

<sup>3</sup> Relate it to your children, and your children to their children, and their children to the generation after them.

<sup>4</sup> What the gnawing locust left the swarming locust has eaten, and what the swarming locust left the crawling locust has eaten, and what the crawling locust left the consuming locust has eaten.

<sup>5</sup> Wake up, you drunkards, and weep. And wail, all you drinkers of wine, on account of the new wine, for it has been cut off from your mouth.

<sup>6</sup> For a nation has come up against My land, strong, and innumerable. Its teeth are the teeth of a lion, and it has the fangs of a lioness.

<sup>7</sup> It has laid waste My vine and splintered My fig tree. It has made it entirely bare and cast it away, its branches became white.

<sup>8</sup> Wail like a maiden girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth.

<sup>9</sup> The grain offering and the drink offering have been cut off from the House of יהוה. The priests, servants of יהוה, have mourned.

<sup>10</sup> The field is ravaged, the ground has mourned, for the grain is ruined, the new wine has dried up, the oil fails.

<sup>11</sup> The farmers are ashamed, the vinedressers wail over the wheat and over the barley, for the harvest of the field is destroyed.

<sup>12</sup> The vine has dried up, and the fig tree droops, pomegranate, also palm, and apple tree, all the trees of the field are dried up, because joy has dried up among the sons of men.

<sup>13</sup> Gird yourselves and lament, you priests. Wail, you attendants of the altar. Come, lie all night in sackcloth, you attendants of my Elohim. For the grain offering and the drink offering are withheld from the house of your Elohim.

<sup>14</sup> Set apart a fast. Call an assembly, gather the elders, all the inhabitants of the land, into the House of יהוה your Elohim, and cry out to יהוה.

<sup>15</sup> Alas for the day! For the day of יהוה is near, and it comes as destruction from the Almighty.

<sup>16</sup> Is not the food cut off before our eyes, joy and gladness from the House of our Elohim?

<sup>17</sup> The seed has rotted under their clods, storehouses are laid waste, granaries are broken down, for the grain has withered.

<sup>18</sup> How the beasts moan! The herds of cattle are restless, because they have no pasture. The flocks of sheep also perish.

<sup>19</sup> I cry to You יהוה, for fire has consumed the pastures of the wilderness, and a flame has set on fire all the trees of the field.

<sup>20</sup> Even the beasts of the field cry out to You, for the water streams are dried up, and fire has consumed the pastures of the wilderness.
