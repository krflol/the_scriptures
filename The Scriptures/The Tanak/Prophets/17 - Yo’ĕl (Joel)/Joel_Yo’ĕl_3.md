<sup>1</sup> “For look, in those days and at that time, when I turn back the captivity of Yehuḏah and Yerushalayim,

<sup>2</sup> then I shall gather all gentiles, and bring them down to the Valley of Yehoshaphat. And I shall enter into judgment with them there for My people, My inheritance Yisra’ĕl, whom they have scattered among the gentiles, and they have divided up My land.

<sup>3</sup> “And they have cast lots for My people, and have given a young man for a whore, and sold a girl for wine, and drank it.

<sup>4</sup> “And also, what are you to Me, O Tsor and Tsiḏon, and all the coasts of Philistia? Are you repaying Me? And if you are repaying Me, I would swiftly and speedily return your reward on your own head.

<sup>5</sup> “For you have taken My silver and My gold, and brought My treasures into your temples,

<sup>6</sup> and the people of Yehuḏah and the people of Yerushalayim you have sold to the sons of Yawan, to remove them far from their borders.

<sup>7</sup> “See, I am stirring them up out of the place to which you have sold them, and I shall return on your own head what you have done,

<sup>8</sup> and shall sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the people of Yehuḏah, and they shall sell them to the Sheḇaites, to a nation far off. For יהוה has spoken.”

<sup>9</sup> Proclaim this among the gentiles, “Prepare for battle! Wake up the mighty men, let all the men of battle draw near, let them come up.

<sup>10</sup> “Beat your ploughshares into swords and your pruning-hooks into spears, let the weak say, ‘I am strong.’ ”

<sup>11</sup> Hasten and come, all you gentiles, and gather together all around. O יהוה, let Your mighty men come down here.

<sup>12</sup> “Let the gentiles be aroused, and come up to the Valley of Yehoshaphat. For there I shall sit to judge all the gentiles on every side.

<sup>13</sup> “Put in the sickle, for the harvest has grown ripe. Come, go down, for the winepress is filled, the vats overflow, for their evil is great.”

<sup>14</sup> Crowds, crowds in the valley of decision! For the day of יהוה is near in the valley of decision.

<sup>15</sup> Sun and moon shall become dark, and stars shall withdraw their brightness.

<sup>16</sup> And יהוה shall roar from Tsiyon, and give forth His voice from Yerushalayim. And the heavens and earth shall shake, but יהוה shall be a refuge for His people, and a stronghold for the children of Yisra’ĕl.

<sup>17</sup> “Then you shall know that I am יהוה your Elohim, dwelling in Tsiyon, My set-apart mountain. And Yerushalayim shall be set-apart, and foreigners shall not pass through her again.

<sup>18</sup> “And it shall be in that day that the mountains drip with new wine, and the hills flow with milk. And all the streams of Yehuḏah shall be flooded with water, and a fountain flow from the House of יהוה and water the wadi Shittim.

<sup>19</sup> “Mitsrayim shall become a ruin, and Eḏom a ruin, a wilderness, because of violence done to the people of Yehuḏah, whose innocent blood they shed in their land.

<sup>20</sup> “But Yehuḏah shall dwell forever, and Yerushalayim to all generations.

<sup>21</sup> “And I shall avenge their blood, which I have not avenged. And יהוה shall be dwelling in Tsiyon!”
