<sup>1</sup> Then the word of יהוה came to Yĕhu son of Ḥanani, against Ba‛asha, saying,

<sup>2</sup> “Because I raised you up out of the dust and made you ruler over My people Yisra’ĕl, but you walked in the way of Yaroḇ‛am, and made My people Yisra’ĕl sin, to provoke Me with their sins,

<sup>3</sup> see, I am going to sweep away Ba‛asha and his house, and shall make your house like the house of Yaroḇ‛am the son of Neḇat.

<sup>4</sup> “Anyone belonging to Ba‛asha who dies in a city the dogs eat, and anyone belonging to him who dies in a field the birds of the heavens eat.”

<sup>5</sup> And the rest of the acts of Ba‛asha, what he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the annals of the sovereigns of Yisra’ĕl?

<sup>6</sup> So Ba‛asha slept with his fathers and was buried in Tirtsah. And his son Ĕlah reigned in his place.

<sup>7</sup> Moreover, the word of יהוה came by the prophet Yĕhu son of Ḥanani against Ba‛asha and his house, because of all the evil that he did in the eyes of יהוה in provoking Him with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Yaroḇ‛am, and because he smote them.

<sup>8</sup> In the twenty-sixth year of Asa sovereign of Yehuḏah, Ĕlah son of Ba‛asha began to reign over Yisra’ĕl in Tirtsah, two years.

<sup>9</sup> And his servant Zimri, commander of half his chariots, conspired against him as he was in Tirtsah drinking himself drunk in the house of Artsa, who was over his house in Tirtsah.

<sup>10</sup> Then Zimri came in and smote him and killed him in the twenty-seventh year of Asa sovereign of Yehuḏah, and reigned in his place.

<sup>11</sup> And it came to be, when he began to reign, as soon as he was seated on his throne, that he smote all the household of Ba‛asha. He did not leave him one male, neither of his relatives nor of his friends.

<sup>12</sup> So Zimri destroyed the entire house of Ba‛asha, according to the word of יהוה, which He spoke against Ba‛asha by Yĕhu the prophet,

<sup>13</sup> for all the sins of Ba‛asha and the sins of Ĕlah his son, by which they had sinned and by which they had made Yisra’ĕl sin, in provoking יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl with their worthlessnesses.

<sup>14</sup> And the rest of the acts of Ĕlah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the sovereigns of Yisra’ĕl?

<sup>15</sup> In the twenty-seventh year of Asa sovereign of Yehuḏah, Zimri reigned seven days in Tirtsah. And the people were encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines.

<sup>16</sup> And the people who were encamped heard it said, “Zimri has conspired and also smote the sovereign.” So all Yisra’ĕl set up Omri, the commander of the army, to reign over Yisra’ĕl that day in the camp.

<sup>17</sup> And Omri went up, and all Yisra’ĕl with him, from Gibbethon, and they besieged Tirtsah.

<sup>18</sup> And it came to be, when Zimri saw that the city was captured, that he went into a high place of the sovereign’s house and burned the sovereign’s house down upon himself with fire, and died,

<sup>19</sup> because of the sins which he had sinned in doing evil in the eyes of יהוה, in walking in the way of Yaroḇ‛am, and in his sin which he had committed to make Yisra’ĕl sin.

<sup>20</sup> And the rest of the acts of Zimri, and the conspiracy he made, are they not written in the book of the annals of the sovereigns of Yisra’ĕl?

<sup>21</sup> Then the people of Yisra’ĕl were divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tiḇni son of Ginath, to make him reign, and half followed Omri.

<sup>22</sup> But the people who followed Omri were stronger than the people who followed Tiḇni son of Ginath. And Tiḇni died and Omri reigned.

<sup>23</sup> In the thirty-first year of Asa sovereign of Yehuḏah, Omri became sovereign over Yisra’ĕl, and reigned twelve years. He reigned six years in Tirtsah.

<sup>24</sup> And he bought the hill of Shomeron from Shemer for two talents of silver, and built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, Shomeron, after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill.

<sup>25</sup> And Omri did evil in the eyes of יהוה, and did evil more than all those before him,

<sup>26</sup> and walked in all the ways of Yaroḇ‛am son of Neḇat, and in his sin by which he had made Yisra’ĕl sin, provoking יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl with their worthlessnesses.

<sup>27</sup> And the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and the might that he attained, are they not written in the book of the annals of the sovereigns of Yisra’ĕl?

<sup>28</sup> So Omri slept with his fathers and was buried in Shomeron. And Aḥaḇ his son reigned in his place.

<sup>29</sup> In the thirty-eighth year of Asa sovereign of Yehuḏah, Aḥaḇ son of Omri became sovereign over Yisra’ĕl. And Aḥaḇ son of Omri reigned over Yisra’ĕl in Shomeron twenty-two years.

<sup>30</sup> And Aḥaḇ son of Omri did evil in the eyes of יהוה, more than all those before him.

<sup>31</sup> And it came to be, as though it had been a light matter for him to walk in the sins of Yaroḇ‛am son of Neḇat, that he took as wife Izeḇel the daughter of Ethba‛al, sovereign of the Tsiḏonians. And he went and served Ba‛al and bowed himself to it,

<sup>32</sup> and raised up an altar for Ba‛al in the house of Ba‛al, which he had built in Shomeron.

<sup>33</sup> And Aḥaḇ made an Ashĕrah. And Aḥaḇ did more to provoke יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl than all the sovereigns of Yisra’ĕl before him.

<sup>34</sup> In his days Ḥi’ĕl of Bĕyth Ĕl built Yeriḥo. He laid its foundation at the cost of Aḇiram his first-born, and at the cost of his youngest son Seḡuḇ he set up its gates, according to the word of יהוה, which He had spoken through Yehoshua son of Nun.

<sup>1</sup> Then the word of יהוה came to Yĕhu son of Ḥanani, against Ba‛asha, saying,

<sup>2</sup> “Because I raised you up out of the dust and made you ruler over My people Yisra’ĕl, but you walked in the way of Yaroḇ‛am, and made My people Yisra’ĕl sin, to provoke Me with their sins,

<sup>3</sup> see, I am going to sweep away Ba‛asha and his house, and shall make your house like the house of Yaroḇ‛am the son of Neḇat.
