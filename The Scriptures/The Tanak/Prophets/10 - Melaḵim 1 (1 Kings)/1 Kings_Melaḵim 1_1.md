<sup>1</sup> And Sovereign Dawiḏ was old, advanced in years. And they covered him with garments, but he could not get warm.

<sup>2</sup> So his servants said to him, “Let them seek for our master the sovereign a young woman, a maiden, and she shall stand before the sovereign and be his companion, and shall lie in your bosom, so that our master the sovereign gets warm.”

<sup>3</sup> And they sought for a lovely young woman in all the border of Yisra’ĕl, and found Aḇishaḡ the Shunammite, and brought her to the sovereign.

<sup>4</sup> And the young woman was very lovely. And she was a companion for the sovereign, and served him, but the sovereign did not know her.

<sup>5</sup> And Aḏoniyah son of Ḥaggith exalted himself, saying, “I reign.” And he prepared for himself a chariot and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.

<sup>6</sup> Now his father had not worried him at any time by saying, “Why have you done so?” He was also very good-looking. And he was born after Aḇshalom.

<sup>7</sup> And he talked with Yo’aḇ son of Tseruyah and with Eḇyathar the priest, and they supported Aḏoniyah.

<sup>8</sup> But Tsaḏoq the priest, and Benayahu son of Yehoyaḏa, and Nathan the prophet, and Shim‛i, and Rĕ‛i, and the mighty men who belonged to Dawiḏ were not with Aḏoniyahu.

<sup>9</sup> And Aḏoniyahu offered sheep and cattle and fatlings by the stone of Zoḥeleth, which is by Ĕn Roḡĕl. He also invited all his brothers, the sovereign’s sons, and all the men of Yehuḏah, servants of the sovereign.

<sup>10</sup> But he did not invite Nathan the prophet, or Benayahu, or the mighty men, or Shelomoh his brother.

<sup>11</sup> Nathan then spoke to Bathsheḇa the mother of Shelomoh, saying, “Have you not heard that Aḏoniyahu son of Ḥaggith has become sovereign, and Dawiḏ our master does not know it?

<sup>12</sup> “And now, come let me give you advice, and deliver your own life and the life of your son Shelomoh.

<sup>13</sup> “Go immediately to Sovereign Dawiḏ and say to him, ‘Did you not, my master, O sovereign, swear to your female servant, saying, “Certainly, your son Shelomoh shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne”? Why then has Aḏoniyahu become sovereign?’

<sup>14</sup> “Look, while you are still speaking there with the sovereign let me come in after you and confirm your words.”

<sup>15</sup> And Bathsheḇa went into the room to the sovereign. Now the sovereign was very old, and Aḇishaḡ the Shunammite was serving the sovereign.

<sup>16</sup> And Bathsheḇa bowed and did obeisance to the sovereign. And the sovereign said, “What do you wish?”

<sup>17</sup> And she said to him, “My master, you swore by יהוה your Elohim to your female servant, saying, ‘Certainly, Shelomoh your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne.’

<sup>18</sup> “And now, look! Aḏoniyah has become sovereign. And now, my master the sovereign, you do not know about it.

<sup>19</sup> “And he has offered great numbers of bulls and fatlings and sheep, and has invited all the sons of the sovereign, and Eḇyathar the priest, and Yo’aḇ the commander of the army, but he did not invite Shelomoh your servant.

<sup>20</sup> “And you my master, O sovereign, the eyes of all Yisra’ĕl are on you, to declare to them who is going to sit on the throne of my master the sovereign after him.

<sup>21</sup> “Otherwise it shall be, when my master the sovereign rests with his fathers, that I and my son Shelomoh shall be considered sinners.”

<sup>22</sup> And see, while she was still speaking with the sovereign, Nathan the prophet also came in.

<sup>23</sup> So they informed the sovereign, saying, “Here is Nathan the prophet.” And when he came in before the sovereign, he bowed down before the sovereign with his face to the ground.

<sup>24</sup> And Nathan said, “My master, O sovereign, have you said, ‘Aḏoniyahu shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne’?

<sup>25</sup> “For he has gone down today, and has offered great numbers of bulls and fatlings and sheep, and has invited all the sovereign’s sons, and the commanders of the army, and Eḇyathar the priest. And look! They are eating and drinking before him. And they say, ‘Let Sovereign Aḏoniyahu live!’

<sup>26</sup> “But he has not invited me, me your servant, nor Tsaḏoq the priest, nor Benayahu son of Yehoyaḏa, nor your servant Shelomoh.

<sup>27</sup> “If this matter is from my master the sovereign, then you did not let your servant know who should sit on the throne of my master the sovereign after him.”

<sup>28</sup> And Sovereign Dawiḏ answered and said, “Call Bathsheḇa to me.” So she came into the sovereign’s presence and stood before the sovereign.

<sup>29</sup> And the sovereign took an oath and said, “As יהוה lives, who has redeemed my life out of all distress,

<sup>30</sup> even as I swore to you by יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, saying, ‘Certainly, Shelomoh your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne in my place,’ even so I do this day.”

<sup>31</sup> And Bathsheḇa bowed with her face to the earth, and did obeisance to the sovereign, and said, “Let my master Sovereign Dawiḏ live forever!”

<sup>32</sup> And Sovereign Dawiḏ said, “Call me Tsaḏoq the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benayahu son of Yehoyaḏa.” And they came before the sovereign.

<sup>33</sup> And the sovereign said to them, “Take with you the servants of your master, and you shall have Shelomoh my son ride on my own mule, and take him down to Giḥon.

<sup>34</sup> “And there Tsaḏoq the priest and Nathan the prophet shall anoint him sovereign over Yisra’ĕl. And blow the horn, and say, ‘Let Sovereign Shelomoh live!’

<sup>35</sup> “And you shall come up after him, and he shall come and sit on my throne, and he shall reign in my place. For I have appointed him to be ruler over Yisra’ĕl and over Yehuḏah.”

<sup>36</sup> And Benayahu son of Yehoyaḏa answered the sovereign and said, “Amĕn! So says יהוה Elohim of my master the sovereign.

<sup>37</sup> “As יהוה has been with my master the sovereign, so let Him be with Shelomoh and make his throne greater than the throne of my master Sovereign Dawiḏ.”

<sup>38</sup> Then Tsaḏoq the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benayahu son of Yehoyaḏa, and the Kerĕthites, and the Pelĕthites went down and had Shelomoh ride on Sovereign Dawiḏ’s mule, and took him to Giḥon.

<sup>39</sup> And Tsaḏoq the priest took a horn of oil from the Tent and anointed Shelomoh. And they blew the horn, and all the people said, “Let Sovereign Shelomoh live!”

<sup>40</sup> And all the people came up after him. And the people played the flutes and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth was split by their noise!

<sup>41</sup> And Aḏoniyahu and all the guests who were with him heard it as they had finished eating. And Yo’aḇ heard the sound of the horn, and said, “Why is the city in such a noisy uproar?”

<sup>42</sup> And he was still speaking, then see, Yonathan came, son of Eḇyathar the priest. And Aḏoniyahu said to him, “Come in, for you are a brave man, and you bring good news.”

<sup>43</sup> But Yonathan answered and said to Aḏoniyahu, “No! Our master Sovereign Dawiḏ has made Shelomoh sovereign,

<sup>44</sup> and the sovereign has sent with him Tsaḏoq the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benayahu son of Yehoyaḏa, and the Kerĕthites, and the Pelĕthites. And they had him ride on the sovereign’s mule.

<sup>45</sup> “And Tsaḏoq the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him sovereign at Giḥon. And they have gone up from there rejoicing, and the city is moved. This is the noise you heard.

<sup>46</sup> “And further, Shelomoh sits on the throne of the reign.

<sup>47</sup> “And further, the servants of the sovereign have gone to bless our master Sovereign Dawiḏ, saying, ‘Let your Elohim make the name of Shelomoh better than your name, and his throne greater than your throne.’ And the sovereign bowed himself on the bed.

<sup>48</sup> “And the sovereign also said thus, ‘Blessed be יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, who has given one to sit on my throne this day, while my eyes see it!’ ”

<sup>49</sup> And all the guests who were invited by Aḏoniyahu were afraid, and rose, and each one went his way.

<sup>50</sup> And Aḏoniyahu was afraid of Shelomoh, and rose, and went and took hold of the horns of the altar.

<sup>51</sup> And it was reported to Shelomoh, saying, “Look, Aḏoniyahu is afraid of Sovereign Shelomoh. And look, he has taken hold of the horns of the altar, saying, ‘Let Sovereign Shelomoh swear to me today that he does not put his servant to death with the sword.’ ”

<sup>52</sup> And Shelomoh said, “If he proves himself a worthy man, not one hair of him is going to fall to the earth, but if evil is found in him, then he shall die.”

<sup>53</sup> And Sovereign Shelomoh sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and fell down before Sovereign Shelomoh. And Shelomoh said to him, “Go to your house.”
