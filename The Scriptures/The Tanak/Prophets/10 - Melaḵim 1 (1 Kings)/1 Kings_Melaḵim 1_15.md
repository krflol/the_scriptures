<sup>1</sup> And in the eighteenth year of Sovereign Yaroḇ‛am son of Neḇat, Aḇiyam became sovereign over Yehuḏah.

<sup>2</sup> He reigned three years in Yerushalayim, and his mother’s name was Ma‛aḵah the granddaughter of Aḇishalom.

<sup>3</sup> And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him, and his heart was not perfect to יהוה his Elohim, as was the heart of his father Dawiḏ.

<sup>4</sup> But for Dawiḏ’s sake יהוה his Elohim gave him a lamp in Yerushalayim, to raise up his son after him and by establishing Yerushalayim,

<sup>5</sup> for Dawiḏ did what was right in the eyes of יהוה, and did not turn aside from all that He commanded him all the days of his life, except in the matter of Uriyah the Ḥittite.

<sup>6</sup> And there was fighting between Reḥaḇ‛am and Yaroḇ‛am all the days of his life.

<sup>7</sup> And the rest of the acts of Aḇiyam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the sovereigns of Yehuḏah? And there was fighting between Aḇiyam and Yaroḇ‛am.

<sup>8</sup> So Aḇiyam slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the City of Dawiḏ. And Asa his son reigned in his place.

<sup>9</sup> And in the twentieth year of Yaroḇ‛am sovereign of Yisra’ĕl, Asa became sovereign over Yehuḏah.

<sup>10</sup> And he reigned forty-one years in Yerushalayim, and his grandmother’s name was Ma‛aḵah the granddaughter of Aḇishalom.

<sup>11</sup> And Asa did what was right in the eyes of יהוה, as his father Dawiḏ had done,

<sup>12</sup> and put away the cult prostitutes from the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made.

<sup>13</sup> And he also removed Ma‛aḵah his grandmother from being sovereigness mother, because she had made an abominable image for Ashĕrah. And Asa cut down her abominable image and burned it by the wadi Qiḏron.

<sup>14</sup> But the high places were not removed. However, Asa’s heart was perfect with יהוה all his days.

<sup>15</sup> And he brought into the House of יהוה the set-apart items of his father, and his own set-apart items: silver and gold and utensils.

<sup>16</sup> And there was fighting between Asa and Ba‛asha sovereign of Yisra’ĕl all their days.

<sup>17</sup> And Ba‛asha sovereign of Yisra’ĕl came up against Yehuḏah, and built Ramah, to keep anyone from going out or coming in to Asa sovereign of Yehuḏah.

<sup>18</sup> And Asa took all the silver and gold that was left in the treasuries of the House of יהוה and the treasuries of the sovereign’s house, and gave them into the hand of his servants. And Sovereign Asa sent them to Ben-Haḏaḏ son of Taḇrimmon, son of Ḥezyon, sovereign of Aram, who dwelt in Damascus, saying,

<sup>19</sup> “Let there be a covenant between you and me, as there was between my father and your father. Look, I have sent you a present of silver and gold. Come, break your covenant with Ba‛asha sovereign of Yisra’ĕl, so that he withdraws from me.”

<sup>20</sup> And Ben-Haḏaḏ listened to Sovereign Asa, and sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Yisra’ĕl, and smote Iyon, and Dan, and Aḇĕl Bĕyth Ma‛aḵah, and all Kinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali.

<sup>21</sup> And it came to be, when Ba‛asha heard it, that he stopped building Ramah, and remained in Tirtsah.

<sup>22</sup> Then Sovereign Asa summoned all Yehuḏah – none was exempted – and they took away the stones and timber of Ramah, which Ba‛asha had used for building. And with them Sovereign Asa built Geḇa of Binyamin, and Mitspah.

<sup>23</sup> And the rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, are they not written in the book of the annals of the sovereigns of Yehuḏah? But in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet.

<sup>24</sup> So Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the City of Dawiḏ his father. And Yehoshaphat his son reigned in his place.

<sup>25</sup> And Naḏaḇ son of Yaroḇ‛am became sovereign over Yisra’ĕl in the second year of Asa sovereign of Yehuḏah, and he reigned over Yisra’ĕl two years.

<sup>26</sup> And he did evil in the eyes of יהוה, and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin by which he had made Yisra’ĕl sin.

<sup>27</sup> Then Ba‛asha son of Aḥiyah, of the house of Yissasḵar, conspired against him. And Ba‛asha smote him at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines, for Naḏaḇ and all Yisra’ĕl had laid siege to Gibbethon.

<sup>28</sup> And Ba‛asha killed him in the third year of Asa sovereign of Yehuḏah, and reigned in his place.

<sup>29</sup> And it came to be, when he became sovereign, that he smote all the house of Yaroḇ‛am. He did not leave to Yaroḇ‛am anyone breathing, until he had destroyed him, according to the word of יהוה which He had spoken by His servant Aḥiyah the Shilonite,

<sup>30</sup> because of the sins of Yaroḇ‛am, which he had sinned and by which he had made Yisra’ĕl sin, because of his provocation with which he had provoked יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl.

<sup>31</sup> And the rest of the acts of Naḏaḇ, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the sovereigns of Yisra’ĕl?

<sup>32</sup> And there was fighting between Asa and Ba‛asha sovereign of Yisra’ĕl all their days.

<sup>33</sup> In the third year of Asa sovereign of Yehuḏah, Ba‛asha son of Aḥiyah became sovereign over all Yisra’ĕl in Tirtsah, and reigned twenty-four years.

<sup>34</sup> And he did evil in the eyes of יהוה, and walked in the way of Yaroḇ‛am, and in his sin by which he had made Yisra’ĕl sin.
