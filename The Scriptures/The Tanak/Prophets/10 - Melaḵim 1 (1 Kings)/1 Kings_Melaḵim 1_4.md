<sup>1</sup> And it came to be that Sovereign Shelomoh was sovereign over all Yisra’ĕl.

<sup>2</sup> And these were his chief officials: Azaryahu son of Tsaḏoq, the priest;

<sup>3</sup> Eliḥoreph and Aḥiyah, sons of Shisha, scribes; Yehoshaphat son of Aḥiluḏ, the recorder;

<sup>4</sup> and Benayahu son of Yehoyaḏa, over the army; and Tsaḏoq and Eḇyathar, the priests;

<sup>5</sup> and Azaryahu son of Nathan, over the officers; Zaḇuḏ son of Nathan, a priest, friend of the sovereign;

<sup>6</sup> and Aḥishar, over the household; and Aḏoniram son of Aḇda, over the compulsory labour.

<sup>7</sup> And Shelomoh had twelve governors over all Yisra’ĕl, who provided food for the sovereign and his household – each one made provision for one month of the year –

<sup>8</sup> and these were their names: Ben-Ḥur, in the mountains of Ephrayim;

<sup>9</sup> Ben-Deqer, in Maqats and Sha‛alḇim and Bĕyth Shemesh and Ĕlon Bĕyth Ḥanan;

<sup>10</sup> Ben-Ḥeseḏ in Arubboth, Soḵoh and all the land of Ḥĕpher were his;

<sup>11</sup> Ben-Aḇinaḏaḇ, all the height of Dor, Taphath the daughter of Shelomoh became his wife;

<sup>12</sup> Ba‛ana son of Aḥiluḏ, in Ta‛anaḵ and Meḡiddo, and all Bĕyth She’an, which is beside Tsarethan below Yizre‛ĕl, from Bĕyth She’an to Aḇĕl Meḥolah, as far as the other side of Yoqne‛am;

<sup>13</sup> Ben-Geḇer, in Ramoth Gil‛aḏ, the towns of Ya’ir son of Menashsheh in Gil‛aḏ were his; the portion of Argoḇ in Bashan, sixty large cities with walls and bronze gate-bars, were his;

<sup>14</sup> Aḥinaḏaḇ son of Iddo, in Maḥanayim;

<sup>15</sup> Aḥima‛ats in Naphtali; he also took Basemath the daughter of Shelomoh as wife;

<sup>16</sup> Ba‛anah son of Ḥushai, in Ashĕr and in Aloth;

<sup>17</sup> Yehoshaphat son of Paruwaḥ, in Yissasḵar;

<sup>18</sup> Shim‛i son of Ĕlah, in Binyamin;

<sup>19</sup> Geḇer son of Uri, in the land of Gil‛aḏ, in the land of Siḥon sovereign of the Amorites and of Oḡ sovereign of Bashan, and one governor was in the land.

<sup>20</sup> Yehuḏah and Yisra’ĕl were as numerous as the sand by the sea, eating and drinking and rejoicing.

<sup>21</sup> And Shelomoh was ruling over all reigns from the River to the land of the Philistines, as far as the border of Mitsrayim. They did taskwork and served Shelomoh all the days of his life.

<sup>22</sup> And Shelomoh’s food supply for one day was thirty kors of fine flour, and sixty kors of meal,

<sup>23</sup> ten fatted cattle and twenty cattle from the pastures, and one hundred sheep, besides deer, and gazelles, and roebucks, and fatted fowl.

<sup>24</sup> For he was ruling over all on this side of the River from Tiphsaḥ even to Azzah, over all the sovereigns on this side of the River. And he had peace on all sides round about him.

<sup>25</sup> And Yehuḏah and Yisra’ĕl dwelt safely, each man under his vine and his fig tree, from Dan as far as Be’ĕrsheḇa, all the days of Shelomoh.

<sup>26</sup> And Shelomoh had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.

<sup>27</sup> And these governors, each one in his month, provided food for Sovereign Shelomoh and for all who came to the table of Sovereign Shelomoh. There was no lack in their supply.

<sup>28</sup> They also brought barley and straw to the appointed place, for the horses and steeds, each one according to his right- ruling.

<sup>29</sup> And Elohim gave Shelomoh exceeding great wisdom and understanding, and largeness of heart like the sand on the seashore.

<sup>30</sup> And Shelomoh’s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the men of the East and all the wisdom of Mitsrayim.

<sup>31</sup> For he was wiser than all men, than Ĕythan the Ezrahite, and Hĕman, and Kalkol, and Darda, the sons of Maḥol. And his name was in all the nations round about.

<sup>32</sup> And he spoke three thousand proverbs, and his songs were one thousand and five.

<sup>33</sup> And he spoke of trees, from the cedar tree of Leḇanon even to the hyssop that springs out of the wall. And he spoke of beasts, and of birds, and of creeping creatures, and of fish.

<sup>34</sup> And there came from all peoples, from all the sovereigns of the earth who had heard of his wisdom, to hear the wisdom of Shelomoh.
