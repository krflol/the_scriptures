<sup>1</sup> And it came to be, in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Yisra’ĕl had come out of the land of Mitsrayim, in the fourth year of the reign of Shelomoh over Yisra’ĕl, in the month of Ziw, which is the second month, that he began to build the House of יהוה.

<sup>2</sup> And the house which Sovereign Shelomoh built for יהוה was sixty cubits long, and twenty wide, and thirty cubits high.

<sup>3</sup> And the porch at the front of the hĕḵal of the House was twenty cubits long, according to the breadth of the House, and its width ten cubits, from the front of the House.

<sup>4</sup> And he made for the House windows with narrowed frames.

<sup>5</sup> And against the wall of the House he built rooms all around, against the walls of the House, all around the hĕḵal and the Speaking Place. Thus he made side rooms all around.

<sup>6</sup> The lowest side room was five cubits wide, and the middle one was six cubits wide, and the third one was seven cubits wide; for he made narrow ledges around the outside of the House, so as not to lay hold on the walls of the House.

<sup>7</sup> And the House, when it was being built, was built with finished stone made ready beforehand, so that no hammer or chisel or any iron tool was heard in the House while it was being built.

<sup>8</sup> The doorway for the middle side room was on the right side of the House. And they went up by stairs to the middle side rooms, and from the middle to the third.

<sup>9</sup> So he built the House and completed it, and he panelled the House with beams and boards of cedar.

<sup>10</sup> And he built the side rooms of the structure against all the House, each five cubits high, and they were fastened to the House with cedar beams.

<sup>11</sup> And the word of יהוה came to Shelomoh, saying,

<sup>12</sup> “This House which you are building – if you walk in My laws, and do My right-rulings, and shall guard all My commands and walk in them, then I shall confirm My word with you, which I spoke to your father Dawiḏ,

<sup>13</sup> and shall dwell in the midst of the children of Yisra’ĕl, and not forsake My people Yisra’ĕl.”

<sup>14</sup> So Shelomoh built the House and completed it.

<sup>15</sup> And he built the walls of the House inside with cedar boards, from the floor of the House to the ceiling he panelled them on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the House with planks of cypress.

<sup>16</sup> And he built twenty cubits at the rear of the House, from floor to the walls, with cedar boards. And he built it inside as the Speaking Place, as the Most Set-apart Place.

<sup>17</sup> And the House was forty cubits, it is the hĕḵal before it.

<sup>18</sup> And the cedar for the House inside was carved with ornaments and open flowers; all was cedar, not a stone was seen.

<sup>19</sup> And he prepared the Speaking Place in the midst of the House, to place the ark of the covenant of יהוה there.

<sup>20</sup> And the front of the Speaking Place was twenty cubits long, and twenty cubits wide, and twenty cubits high. And he overlaid it with refined gold, and overlaid the altar of cedar.

<sup>21</sup> And Shelomoh overlaid the inside of the House with refined gold, and made gold chains pass over the front of the Speaking Place, and overlaid it with gold.

<sup>22</sup> Thus he overlaid the entire House with gold, until the entire House was completed. And the entire altar that was by the Speaking Place he overlaid with gold.

<sup>23</sup> And inside the Speaking Place he made two keruḇim of olive wood, ten cubits high.

<sup>24</sup> And one wing of the keruḇ was five cubits, and the other wing of the keruḇ five cubits – ten cubits from the tip of one wing to the tip of the other.

<sup>25</sup> And the other keruḇ was ten cubits. Both keruḇim were of the same size and shape.

<sup>26</sup> The height of one keruḇ was ten cubits, and so was the other keruḇ.

<sup>27</sup> And he placed the keruḇim in the midst of the inner house. And they stretched out the wings of the keruḇim so that the wing of the one touched one wall, and the wing of the other keruḇ touched the other wall. And their wings touched each other in the middle of the room.

<sup>28</sup> And he overlaid the keruḇim with gold.

<sup>29</sup> And he carved all the walls of the House all around, both inside and outside, with carved figures of keruḇim, and palm trees, and open flowers.

<sup>30</sup> And he overlaid the floor of the House with gold, inside and outside.

<sup>31</sup> And for the entrance of the Speaking Place he made doors of olive wood: the lintel, doorposts, a fifth.

<sup>32</sup> And the two doors were of olive wood. And he carved on them figures of keruḇim, and palm trees, and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold. And he spread the gold on the keruḇim and on the palm trees.

<sup>33</sup> And so he made doorposts for the door of the hĕḵal of olive wood – a fourth part.

<sup>34</sup> And the two doors were of cypress wood, the two leaves of the one folded, and two leaves of the other door folded.

<sup>35</sup> And he carved keruḇim, and palm trees, and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold laid smoothly on the carved work.

<sup>36</sup> And he built the inner courtyard with three rows of hewn stone and a row of cedar beams.

<sup>37</sup> In the fourth year the foundation of the House of יהוה was laid, in the month Ziw.

<sup>38</sup> And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, the eighth month, the house was completed in all its matters and according to all its plans. Thus he built it for seven years.

<sup>1</sup> And it came to be, in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Yisra’ĕl had come out of the land of Mitsrayim, in the fourth year of the reign of Shelomoh over Yisra’ĕl, in the month of Ziw, which is the second month, that he began to build the House of יהוה.

<sup>2</sup> And the house which Sovereign Shelomoh built for יהוה was sixty cubits long, and twenty wide, and thirty cubits high.

<sup>3</sup> And the porch at the front of the hĕḵal of the House was twenty cubits long, according to the breadth of the House, and its width ten cubits, from the front of the House.

<sup>4</sup> And he made for the House windows with narrowed frames.

<sup>5</sup> And against the wall of the House he built rooms all around, against the walls of the House, all around the hĕḵal and the Speaking Place. Thus he made side rooms all around.

<sup>6</sup> The lowest side room was five cubits wide, and the middle one was six cubits wide, and the third one was seven cubits wide; for he made narrow ledges around the outside of the House, so as not to lay hold on the walls of the House.

<sup>7</sup> And the House, when it was being built, was built with finished stone made ready beforehand, so that no hammer or chisel or any iron tool was heard in the House while it was being built.

<sup>8</sup> The doorway for the middle side room was on the right side of the House. And they went up by stairs to the middle side rooms, and from the middle to the third.

<sup>9</sup> So he built the House and completed it, and he panelled the House with beams and boards of cedar.

<sup>10</sup> And he built the side rooms of the structure against all the House, each five cubits high, and they were fastened to the House with cedar beams.

<sup>11</sup> And the word of יהוה came to Shelomoh, saying,

<sup>12</sup> “This House which you are building – if you walk in My laws, and do My right-rulings, and shall guard all My commands and walk in them, then I shall confirm My word with you, which I spoke to your father Dawiḏ,

<sup>13</sup> and shall dwell in the midst of the children of Yisra’ĕl, and not forsake My people Yisra’ĕl.”

<sup>14</sup> So Shelomoh built the House and completed it.

<sup>15</sup> And he built the walls of the House inside with cedar boards, from the floor of the House to the ceiling he panelled them on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the House with planks of cypress.

<sup>16</sup> And he built twenty cubits at the rear of the House, from floor to the walls, with cedar boards. And he built it inside as the Speaking Place, as the Most Set-apart Place.

<sup>17</sup> And the House was forty cubits, it is the hĕḵal before it.

<sup>19</sup> And he prepared the Speaking Place in the midst of the House, to place the ark of the covenant of יהוה there.

<sup>20</sup> And the front of the Speaking Place was twenty cubits long, and twenty cubits wide, and twenty cubits high. And he overlaid it with refined gold, and overlaid the altar of cedar.

<sup>21</sup> And Shelomoh overlaid the inside of the House with refined gold, and made gold chains pass over the front of the Speaking Place, and overlaid it with gold.

<sup>22</sup> Thus he overlaid the entire House with gold, until the entire House was completed. And the entire altar that was by the Speaking Place he overlaid with gold.

<sup>23</sup> And inside the Speaking Place he made two keruḇim of olive wood, ten cubits high.

<sup>24</sup> And one wing of the keruḇ was five cubits, and the other wing of the keruḇ five cubits – ten cubits from the tip of one wing to the tip of the other.

<sup>25</sup> And the other keruḇ was ten cubits. Both keruḇim were of the same size and shape.

<sup>26</sup> The height of one keruḇ was ten cubits, and so was the other keruḇ.

<sup>27</sup> And he placed the keruḇim in the midst of the inner house. And they stretched out the wings of the keruḇim so that the wing of the one touched one wall, and the wing of the other keruḇ touched the other wall. And their wings touched each other in the middle of the room.

<sup>28</sup> And he overlaid the keruḇim with gold.

<sup>29</sup> And he carved all the walls of the House all around, both inside and outside, with carved figures of keruḇim, and palm trees, and open flowers.

<sup>30</sup> And he overlaid the floor of the House with gold, inside and outside.

<sup>31</sup> And for the entrance of the Speaking Place he made doors of olive wood: the lintel, doorposts, a fifth.

<sup>32</sup> And the two doors were of olive wood. And he carved on them figures of keruḇim, and palm trees, and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold. And he spread the gold on the keruḇim and on the palm trees.

<sup>36</sup> And he built the inner courtyard with three rows of hewn stone and a row of cedar beams.

<sup>37</sup> In the fourth year the foundation of the House of יהוה was laid, in the month Ziw.

<sup>38</sup> And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, the eighth month, the house was completed in all its matters and according to all its plans. Thus he built it for seven years.
