<sup>1</sup> At that time Aḇiyah the son of Yaroḇ‛am became sick.

<sup>2</sup> And Yaroḇ‛am said to his wife, “Please arise, and disguise yourself, so they do not know that you are the wife of Yaroḇ‛am, and go to Shiloh. See, Aḥiyah the prophet is there, who spoke to me of becoming sovereign over this people.

<sup>3</sup> “And you shall take with you ten loaves, and cakes, and a jar of honey, and go to him. Let him declare to you what becomes of the child.”

<sup>4</sup> And Yaroḇ‛am’s wife did so, and rose up and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Aḥiyah. But Aḥiyahu was unable to see, for his eyes had set because of his age.

<sup>5</sup> And יהוה had said to Aḥiyahu, “See, the wife of Yaroḇ‛am is coming to ask you a word about her son, for he is sick. Speak to her thus and thus. For it shall be, when she comes in, that she makes herself strange.”

<sup>6</sup> And it came to be, when Aḥiyahu heard the sound of her footsteps as she came through the door, he said, “Come in, wife of Yaroḇ‛am. Why are you making yourself strange? And I have been sent to you with a hard word.

<sup>7</sup> Go, say to Yaroḇ‛am, ‘Thus said יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, “Because I exalted you from among the people, and made you ruler over My people Yisra’ĕl,

<sup>8</sup> and tore the reign away from the house of Dawiḏ, and gave it to you – and you have not been as My servant Dawiḏ, who guarded My commands and who followed Me with all his heart, to do only what was right in My eyes,

<sup>9</sup> but you have done more evil than all who were before you, for you have gone and made for yourself other mighty ones and moulded images to provoke Me, and have cast Me behind your back –

<sup>10</sup> therefore, see, I am bringing evil to the house of Yaroḇ‛am, and shall cut off from Yaroḇ‛am every male in Yisra’ĕl, whether shut up or left at large, and sweep away the remnant of the house of Yaroḇ‛am, as one sweeps away dung until it is all gone.

<sup>11</sup> Those of Yaroḇ‛am who die in the city the dogs do eat, and those who die in the field the birds of the heavens do eat, for יהוה has spoken it!” ’

<sup>12</sup> “And you, arise, go to your house. When your feet enter the city, the child shall die.

<sup>13</sup> “And all Yisra’ĕl shall mourn for him and bury him, for he is the only one of Yaroḇ‛am who shall come to the grave, because in him there is found a good report toward יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, in the house of Yaroḇ‛am.

<sup>14</sup> “And יהוה shall raise up for Himself a sovereign over Yisra’ĕl who cuts off the house of Yaroḇ‛am, this day, and even now!

<sup>15</sup> “And יהוה shall smite Yisra’ĕl, as a reed is shaken in the water, and shall pluck Yisra’ĕl from this good soil which He gave to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond the River, because they made their Ashĕrim, provoking יהוה,

<sup>16</sup> and He shall give Yisra’ĕl up, because of the sins of Yaroḇ‛am, who sinned and who made Yisra’ĕl sin.”

<sup>17</sup> And the wife of Yaroḇ‛am rose up and went, and came to Tirtsah. When she came to the threshold of the house, the child died.

<sup>18</sup> And they buried him, and all Yisra’ĕl lamented for him, according to the word of יהוה which He spoke through His servant Aḥiyahu the prophet.

<sup>19</sup> And the rest of the acts of Yaroḇ‛am, how he fought and how he reigned, see, they are written in the book of the annals of the sovereigns of Yisra’ĕl.

<sup>20</sup> And the days that Yaroḇ‛am reigned was twenty-two years. So he slept with his fathers, and Naḏaḇ his son reigned in his place.

<sup>21</sup> Meanwhile Reḥaḇ‛am son of Shelomoh reigned in Yehuḏah. Reḥaḇ‛am was forty-one years old when he became sovereign, and he reigned seventeen years in Yerushalayim, the city which יהוה had chosen out of all the tribes of Yisra’ĕl, to put His Name there. And his mother’s name was Na‛amah the Ammonitess.

<sup>22</sup> And Yehuḏah did evil in the eyes of יהוה, and they provoked Him to jealousy with their sins which they committed, more than all that their fathers had done.

<sup>23</sup> For they also built for themselves high places, and pillars, and Ashĕrim on every high hill and under every green tree.

<sup>24</sup> And there were also cult prostitutes in the land. They did according to all the abominations of the gentiles which יהוה dispossessed before the children of Yisra’ĕl.

<sup>25</sup> And it came to be, in the fifth year of Sovereign Reḥaḇ‛am, that Shishaq sovereign of Mitsrayim came up against Yerushalayim.

<sup>26</sup> And he took away the treasures of the House of יהוה and the treasures of the sovereign’s house, he even took away all. And he took away all the shields of gold which Shelomoh had made.

<sup>27</sup> And Sovereign Reḥaḇ‛am made shields of bronze to replace them, and entrusted them into the hands of the chiefs of the guard, who guarded the entrance of the sovereign’s house.

<sup>28</sup> And it came to be, whenever the sovereign went into the House of יהוה, the guards would bring them, then take them back into the guardroom.

<sup>29</sup> And the rest of the acts of Reḥaḇ‛am, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the sovereigns of Yehuḏah?

<sup>30</sup> And there was fighting between Reḥaḇ‛am and Yaroḇ‛am all the days.

<sup>31</sup> So Reḥaḇ‛am slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the City of Dawiḏ. And the name of his mother was Na‛amah the Ammonitess. And Aḇiyam his son reigned in his place.

<sup>1</sup> At that time Aḇiyah the son of Yaroḇ‛am became sick.

<sup>2</sup> And Yaroḇ‛am said to his wife, “Please arise, and disguise yourself, so they do not know that you are the wife of Yaroḇ‛am, and go to Shiloh. See, Aḥiyah the prophet is there, who spoke to me of becoming sovereign over this people.
