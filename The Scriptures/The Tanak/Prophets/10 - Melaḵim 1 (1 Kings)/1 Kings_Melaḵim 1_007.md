<sup>1</sup> And Shelomoh built his own house for thirteen years, and he completed his entire house.

<sup>2</sup> And he built the house of the forest of Leḇanon. It was one hundred cubits long, and fifty cubits wide, and thirty cubits high, with four rows of cedar columns, and cedar beams on the columns.

<sup>3</sup> And it was panelled with cedar above the beams that were on forty-five columns, fifteen to a row.

<sup>4</sup> And there were windows with narrowed frames in three rows, and window was opposite window, three times.

<sup>5</sup> And all the doorways and doorposts had square frames. And window was opposite window, three times.

<sup>6</sup> And he made the porch of the columns, fifty cubits long and thirty cubits wide. And the porch was in front of them, and the columns and the roof was in front of them.

<sup>7</sup> And he made a hall for the throne, the Hall of Right-ruling, where he ruled. And it was panelled with cedar from floor to floor.

<sup>8</sup> And the house where he was to dwell, in the other courtyard, within the hall was of like workmanship. And Shelomoh made a house like this hall for Pharaoh’s daughter, whom he had taken.

<sup>9</sup> All these were of precious stone hewn to size, sawed with a saw, inside and out, from the foundation to the coping, and also on the outside to the great courtyard.

<sup>10</sup> And the foundation was of precious stone, large stones, stones of ten cubits and stones of eight cubits.

<sup>11</sup> And above were precious stones, hewn to size, and cedar wood.

<sup>12</sup> So the great courtyard all around had three rows of hewn stones and a row of cedar beams, as was the inner courtyard of the House of יהוה and the porch of the House.

<sup>13</sup> And Sovereign Shelomoh sent and brought Ḥiram from Tsor.

<sup>14</sup> He was the son of a widow from the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tsor, a bronze worker. And he was filled with wisdom and understanding and skill in working with all kinds of bronze work. So he came to Sovereign Shelomoh and did all his work.

<sup>15</sup> And he cast two columns of bronze, each one eighteen cubits high, and a line of twelve cubits measured the circumference of each.

<sup>16</sup> And he made two capitals of cast bronze, to put on the tops of the columns – the height of one capital was five cubits, and the height of the other capital was five cubits –

<sup>17</sup> a lattice network, with wreaths of chainwork, for the capitals which were on top of the columns, seven chains for one capital and seven for the other capital.

<sup>18</sup> And he made the columns, and two rows of pomegranates above the network all around to cover the capitals that were on top, and so he did for the other capital.

<sup>19</sup> And the capitals that were on top of the columns in the hall were in the shape of lilies, four cubits.

<sup>20</sup> And there were capitals above also on the two columns, by the bulge which was next to the network. And the pomegranates were two hundred, in rows on each of the capitals all around.

<sup>21</sup> And he set up the columns by the porch of the hĕḵal. And he set up the column on the right and called its name Yaḵin, and he set up the column on the left and called its name Bo‛az.

<sup>22</sup> And on the top of the columns was lily work. Thus the work of the columns was completed.

<sup>23</sup> And he made the Sea of cast metal, ten cubits from one rim to the other, round all about, and five cubits high, and a line of thirty cubits measured around it.

<sup>24</sup> And below its rim were ornaments all around, ten to a cubit, all the way around the Sea. The ornaments were cast in two rows when it was cast.

<sup>25</sup> It stood on twelve oxen, three facing north, and three facing west, and three facing south, and three facing east. And the Sea was set upon them, and all their back parts were inward.

<sup>26</sup> And it was a handbreadth thick, and its rim was shaped like the rim of a cup, like a lily blossom. It held two thousand baths.

<sup>27</sup> And he made ten stands of bronze, each stand was four cubits long, and four cubits wide, and three cubits high.

<sup>28</sup> And this is how the stands were made: They had side panels, and the side panels were between frames,

<sup>29</sup> and on the side panels that were between the frames were lions, oxen, and keruḇim, and a pedestal above on the frame. Below the lions and oxen were wreaths of beaten work.

<sup>30</sup> And each stand had four bronze wheels and axles of bronze, and its four feet had supports. Under the basin were cast supports beside each wreath.

<sup>31</sup> And its opening inside the crown at the top was one cubit. And the opening was round, like the work of the pedestal, one and a half cubits. And also on the opening were engravings, but the side panels were square, not round.

<sup>32</sup> And the four wheels were under the side panels, and the axles of the wheels were joined to the stand, and the height of a wheel was one and a half cubits.

<sup>33</sup> And the wheels were made like chariot wheels. Their axle pins, and their rims, and their spokes, and their hubs were all cast.

<sup>34</sup> And there were four supports at the four corners of each stand, its supports were of the stand itself.

<sup>35</sup> And on the top of the stand, half a cubit in height – round all around. And on the top of the stand, its flanges and its side panels were of the same.

<sup>36</sup> And on the plates of its flanges and on its side panels he engraved keruḇim, lions, and palm trees, according to the clear space on each, with wreaths all around.

<sup>37</sup> He made the ten stands like this: all of them were of one mould, one measure, and one shape.

<sup>38</sup> And he made ten basins of bronze; each basin contained forty baths, and each basin was four cubits, one basin on each of the ten stands.

<sup>39</sup> And he put five stands on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house, and he put the Sea on the right side of the house to the east, facing the south.

<sup>40</sup> And Ḥiram made the pots and the shovels and the bowls. And Ḥiram completed doing all the work that he was to do for Sovereign Shelomoh on the House of יהוה :

<sup>41</sup> the two columns, and the bowl-shaped capitals that were on top of the columns, and the two networks covering the two bowl-shaped capitals which were on top of the columns;

<sup>42</sup> and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, two rows of pomegranates for each network to cover the two bowl-shaped capitals that were on top of the columns;

<sup>43</sup> and the ten stands, and the ten basins on the stands;

<sup>44</sup> and the one Sea, and twelve oxen under the Sea;

<sup>45</sup> and the pots, and the shovels, and the bowls. And all these utensils which Ḥiram made for Sovereign Shelomoh for the House of יהוה were of polished bronze.

<sup>46</sup> The sovereign had them cast in clay in the district of Yardĕn between Sukkoth and Tsarethan.

<sup>47</sup> And Shelomoh left all the utensils unweighed, because they were many, nor was the weight of the bronze searched out.

<sup>48</sup> So Shelomoh made all the utensils for the House of יהוה : the altar of gold, and the table of gold on which was the showbread;

<sup>49</sup> and the lampstands of refined gold, five on the right side and five on the left in front of the Speaking Place, with the flowers and the lamps and the snuffers of gold;

<sup>50</sup> and the basins, and the snuffers, and the bowls, and the ladles, and the fire holders of refined gold, and the hinges of gold, both for the doors of the inner house, the Most Set-apart Place, and for the doors of the house of the Hĕḵal.

<sup>51</sup> Thus all the work which Sovereign Shelomoh had done for the House of יהוה was completed. And Shelomoh brought in the set-apart items of his father Dawiḏ: the silver and the gold and the utensils, and he put them in the treasuries of the House of יהוה.
