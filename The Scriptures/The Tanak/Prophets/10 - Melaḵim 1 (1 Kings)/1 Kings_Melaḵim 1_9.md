<sup>1</sup> And it came to be, when Shelomoh had finished building the House of יהוה and the house of the sovereign, and all the desire of Shelomoh which he was pleased to do,

<sup>2</sup> that יהוה appeared to Shelomoh the second time, as He had appeared to him at Gib‛on.

<sup>3</sup> And יהוה said to him, “I have heard your prayer and your supplication that you have made before Me. I have set this house apart which you have built to put My Name there forever, and My eyes and My heart shall always be there.

<sup>4</sup> “And you, if you walk before Me as your father Dawiḏ walked, in integrity of heart and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded you, if you guard My laws and My right-rulings,

<sup>5</sup> then I shall establish the throne of your reign over Yisra’ĕl forever, as I promised Dawiḏ your father, saying, ‘There is not to cease a man of yours on the throne of Yisra’ĕl.’

<sup>6</sup> “If you at all turn back, you or your sons, from following Me, and do not guard My commands, My laws, which I have set before you, but shall go and serve other mighty ones and bow yourselves to them,

<sup>7</sup> then I shall cut off Yisra’ĕl from the face of the soil which I have given them, and send away from My presence this house which I have set apart for My Name. And Yisra’ĕl shall be a proverb and a mockery among all the peoples.

<sup>8</sup> “And this house, which has been exalted, everyone who passes by it shall be astonished, and hiss, and say, ‘Why has יהוה done thus to this land and to this house?’

<sup>9</sup> “Then they shall say, ‘Because they have forsaken יהוה their Elohim, who brought their fathers out of the land of Mitsrayim, and they embraced other mighty ones, and bowed themselves to them and served them. That is why יהוה has brought all this evil on them.’ ”

<sup>10</sup> And it came to be, at the end of twenty years, that Shelomoh had built the two houses, the House of יהוה and the house of the sovereign.

<sup>11</sup> Ḥiram the sovereign of Tsor had supplied Shelomoh with cedar and cypress and gold, as much as he desired. Then Sovereign Shelomoh gave Ḥiram twenty cities in the land of Galil.

<sup>12</sup> And Ḥiram came from Tsor to see the cities which Shelomoh had given him, but they were not right in his eyes,

<sup>13</sup> and he said, “What are these cities you have given me, my brother?” And he called them the land of Kaḇul, as they are to this day.

<sup>14</sup> And Ḥiram sent the sovereign one hundred and twenty talents of gold.

<sup>15</sup> And this is the purpose of the compulsory labour which Sovereign Shelomoh raised, to build the House of יהוה, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Yerushalayim, and Ḥatsor, and Meḡiddo, and Gezer –

<sup>16</sup> Pharaoh sovereign of Mitsrayim had gone up and taken Gezer and burned it with fire, and had slain the Kena‛anites who dwelt in the city, and had given it as a payment for the bride to his daughter, Shelomoh’s wife –

<sup>17</sup> and Shelomoh built Gezer, and Lower Bĕyth Ḥoron,

<sup>18</sup> and Ba‛alath, and Tamar in the wilderness, in the land of Yehuḏah,

<sup>19</sup> and all the storage cities that Shelomoh had, and cities for his chariots and cities for his cavalry, and whatever Shelomoh desired to build in Yerushalayim, and in Leḇanon, and in all the land of his rule.

<sup>20</sup> All the people who were left of the Amorites, the Ḥittites, the Perizzites, the Ḥiwwites, and the Yeḇusites, who were not of the children of Yisra’ĕl –

<sup>21</sup> their descendants who were left in the land after them, whom the children of Yisra’ĕl had not been able to destroy completely – from these Shelomoh raised compulsory labour, as it is to this day.

<sup>22</sup> But Shelomoh did not make slaves of the children of Yisra’ĕl, because they were men of battle, and his servants, and his rulers, and his officers, and commanders of his chariots, and his cavalry.

<sup>23</sup> These were the chiefs of the officials who were over the work of Shelomoh: five hundred and fifty, who ruled over the people who did the work.

<sup>24</sup> But the daughter of Pharaoh came up from the City of Dawiḏ to her house that he built for her. Then he built Millo.

<sup>25</sup> And three times a year Shelomoh brought burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar which he had built for יהוה, and he burned incense with that which was before יהוה – thus gave completeness to the House.

<sup>26</sup> And Sovereign Shelomoh built a fleet of ships at Etsyon Geḇer, which is near Ĕyloth on the shore of the Sea of Reeds, in the land of Eḏom.

<sup>27</sup> And Ḥiram sent his servants with the fleet, seamen who knew the sea, to work with the servants of Shelomoh.

<sup>28</sup> And they went to Ophir, and took four hundred and twenty talents of gold from there, and brought it to Sovereign Shelomoh.

<sup>1</sup> And it came to be, when Shelomoh had finished building the House of יהוה and the house of the sovereign, and all the desire of Shelomoh which he was pleased to do,

<sup>2</sup> that יהוה appeared to Shelomoh the second time, as He had appeared to him at Gib‛on.

<sup>3</sup> And יהוה said to him, “I have heard your prayer and your supplication that you have made before Me. I have set this house apart which you have built to put My Name there forever, and My eyes and My heart shall always be there.

<sup>4</sup> “And you, if you walk before Me as your father Dawiḏ walked, in integrity of heart and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded you, if you guard My laws and My right-rulings,
