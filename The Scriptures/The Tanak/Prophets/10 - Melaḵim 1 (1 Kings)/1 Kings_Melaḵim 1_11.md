<sup>1</sup> And Sovereign Shelomoh loved many foreign women in addition to the daughter of Pharaoh: Mo’aḇite, Ammonite, Eḏomite, Tsiḏonian, and Ḥittite women;

<sup>2</sup> from the nations of whom יהוה had said to the children of Yisra’ĕl, “You do not go into them, and they do not go into you, for they shall certainly turn away your hearts after their mighty ones.” Shelomoh clung to these in love.

<sup>3</sup> And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines. And his wives turned away his heart.

<sup>4</sup> And it came to be, when Shelomoh was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other mighty ones. And his heart was not perfect with יהוה his Elohim, as was the heart of his father Dawiḏ.

<sup>5</sup> And Shelomoh went after Ashtoreth the mighty one of the Tsiḏonians, and after Milkom the abomination of the Ammonites.

<sup>6</sup> Thus Shelomoh did evil in the eyes of יהוה, and did not follow יהוה completely, like his father Dawiḏ.

<sup>7</sup> Then Shelomoh built a high place for Kemosh the abomination of Mo’aḇ, on the hill that is east of Yerushalayim, and for Moleḵ the abomination of the children of Ammon.

<sup>8</sup> And so he did for all his foreign wives, who burned incense and slaughtered to their mighty ones.

<sup>9</sup> Therefore יהוה was enraged with Shelomoh, because his heart had turned away from יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, who had appeared to him twice,

<sup>10</sup> and had commanded him concerning this word, not to go after other mighty ones. But he did not guard what יהוה had commanded.

<sup>11</sup> And יהוה said to Shelomoh, “Because you have done this, and have not guarded My covenant and My laws, which I have commanded you, I shall certainly tear the reign away from you and give it to your servant.

<sup>12</sup> “Only, I do not do it in your days, for the sake of your father Dawiḏ. Out of the hand of your son I shall tear it.

<sup>13</sup> “Only, I shall not tear away all the reign but give one tribe to your son for the sake of my servant Dawiḏ, and for the sake of Yerushalayim which I have chosen.”

<sup>14</sup> And יהוה raised up an adversary against Shelomoh, Haḏaḏ the Eḏomite. He was of the seed of the sovereign in Eḏom.

<sup>15</sup> And it came to be, when Dawiḏ was in Eḏom, and Yo’aḇ the commander of the army had gone up to bury the slain, after he had smitten every male in Eḏom –

<sup>16</sup> Yo’aḇ remained there with all Yisra’ĕl for six months, until every male in Eḏom was cut off –

<sup>17</sup> that Haḏaḏ fled to go to Mitsrayim, he and certain Eḏomites of his father’s servants with him, while Haḏaḏ was still a little child.

<sup>18</sup> And they arose from Miḏyan and came to Paran, and took men with them from Paran and came to Mitsrayim, to Pharaoh sovereign of Mitsrayim, who gave him a house, and ordered food for him, and gave him land.

<sup>19</sup> And Haḏaḏ found much favour in the eyes of Pharaoh, so that he gave him as wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Sovereigness Taḥpenĕs.

<sup>20</sup> And the sister of Taḥpenĕs bore him Genuḇath his son, whom Taḥpenĕs weaned in Pharaoh’s house. And Genuḇath was in the house of Pharaoh among the sons of Pharaoh.

<sup>21</sup> And Haḏaḏ heard in Mitsrayim that Dawiḏ slept with his fathers, and that Yo’aḇ the commander of the army was dead, and Haḏaḏ said to Pharaoh, “Let me go to my land.”

<sup>22</sup> And Pharaoh said to him, “But what have you lacked with me, that you are now seeking to go to your own land?” And he answered, “No, but please let me go.”

<sup>23</sup> And Elohim raised up another adversary against him, Rezon son of Elyaḏa who had fled from his master, Haḏaḏezer sovereign of Tsoḇah,

<sup>24</sup> and gathered men to him and became commander over a raiding band, when Dawiḏ slew those of Tsoḇah. And they went to Damascus and dwelt there, and reigned in Damascus.

<sup>25</sup> And he was an adversary of Yisra’ĕl all the days of Shelomoh – besides the trouble that Haḏaḏ caused – and he was hostile to Yisra’ĕl and reigned over Aram.

<sup>26</sup> And a servant of Shelomoh, Yaroḇ‛am son of Neḇat, an Ephrayimite from Tserĕḏah, whose mother’s name was Tseru‛ah, a widow, also lifted up a hand against the sovereign.

<sup>27</sup> And this is what caused him to lift up a hand against the sovereign: Shelomoh had built Millo, repairing the breaks in the City of Dawiḏ his father.

<sup>28</sup> And the man Yaroḇ‛am was a brave man. And Shelomoh, seeing that the young man was doing his work well, made him the officer over all the compulsory labour of the house of Yosĕph.

<sup>29</sup> And it came to be at that time, when Yaroḇ‛am went out of Yerushalayim, that the prophet Aḥiyah the Shilonite met him on the way. And he was wearing a new garment, and the two were alone in the field.

<sup>30</sup> And Aḥiyah took hold of the new garment that was on him, and tore it into twelve pieces,

<sup>31</sup> and said to Yaroḇ‛am, “Take for yourself ten pieces, for thus said יהוה, the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, ‘See, I am tearing the reign out of the hand of Shelomoh and shall give ten tribes to you,

<sup>32</sup> but he shall have one tribe for the sake of My servant Dawiḏ, and for the sake of Yerushalayim, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Yisra’ĕl.

<sup>33</sup> ‘Because they have forsaken Me, and bow themselves to Ashtoreth the mighty one of the Tsiḏonians, to Kemosh the mighty one of the Mo’aḇites, and to Milkom the mighty one of the children of Ammon, and have not walked in My ways – to do what is right in My eyes, and My laws and My right-rulings, as did his father Dawiḏ.

<sup>34</sup> ‘But I do not take all the reign out of his hand, because I have made him ruler all the days of his life for the sake of My servant Dawiḏ, whom I chose because he guarded My commands and My laws.

<sup>35</sup> ‘And I shall take the reign out of his son’s hand and give it to you, the ten tribes.

<sup>36</sup> ‘And to his son I give one tribe, so that My servant Dawiḏ shall always have a lamp before Me in Yerushalayim, the city which I have chosen for Myself, to put My Name there.

<sup>37</sup> ‘So I take you, and you shall reign over all that your being desires, and you shall be sovereign over Yisra’ĕl.

<sup>38</sup> ‘And it shall be, if you obey all that I command you, and shall walk in My ways, and do what is right in My eyes, to guard My laws and My commands, as My servant Dawiḏ did, then I shall be with you and build for you a steadfast house, as I built for Dawiḏ, and shall give Yisra’ĕl to you.

<sup>39</sup> ‘And because of this I humble the seed of Dawiḏ, but not forever.’ ”

<sup>40</sup> And Shelomoh sought to kill Yaroḇ‛am, but Yaroḇ‛am rose up and fled to Mitsrayim, to Shishaq sovereign of Mitsrayim, and was in Mitsrayim until the death of Shelomoh.

<sup>41</sup> And the rest of the acts of Shelomoh, all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of Shelomoh?

<sup>42</sup> And the days that Shelomoh reigned in Yerushalayim over all Yisra’ĕl was forty years.

<sup>43</sup> So Shelomoh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the City of Dawiḏ his father, and Reḥaḇ‛am his son reigned in his place.
