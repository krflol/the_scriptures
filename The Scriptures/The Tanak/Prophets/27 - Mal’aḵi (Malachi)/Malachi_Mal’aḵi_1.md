<sup>2</sup> “I have loved you,” said יהוה. “But you asked, ‘In what way have You loved us?’ “Was not Ĕsaw Ya‛aqoḇ’s brother?” declares יהוה. “And I love Ya‛aqoḇ,

<sup>3</sup> but I have hated Ĕsaw, and have laid waste his mountains and his inheritance for the jackals of the wilderness.”

<sup>4</sup> If Eḏom says, “We have been beaten down, let us return and build the ruins,” יהוה of hosts said thus: “Let them build, but I tear down. And they shall be called ‘Border of Wrongness’, and the people against whom יהוה is enraged forever.

<sup>5</sup> And your eyes shall see, and you shall say, ‘Great is יהוה beyond the border of Yisra’ĕl!’

<sup>6</sup> “A son esteems his father, and a servant his master. And if I am the Father, where is My esteem? And if I am a Master, where is My fear? said יהוה of hosts to you priests who despise My Name. But you asked, ‘In what way have we despised Your Name?’

<sup>7</sup> “You are presenting defiled food on My altar. But you asked, ‘In what way have we defiled You?’ Because you say, ‘The table of יהוה is despicable.’

<sup>8</sup> “And when you present the blind as a slaughtering, is it not evil? And when you present the lame and sick, is it not evil? Bring it then to your governor! Would he be pleased with you? Would he accept you favourably?” said יהוה of hosts.

<sup>9</sup> “And now, entreat the face of Ĕl to show favour to us. This has been done by your hands. Would He show favour to you?” said יהוה of hosts.

<sup>10</sup> “Who among you who would shut the doors, so that you would not kindle fire on My altar for naught? I have no pleasure in you,” said יהוה of hosts, “Nor do I accept an offering from your hands.

<sup>11</sup> “For from the rising of the sun, even to its going down, My Name is great among nations. And in every place incense is presented to My Name, and a clean offering. For My Name is great among nations,” said יהוה of hosts.

<sup>12</sup> “But you are profaning Me, in that you say, ‘The table of יהוה is defiled, and its fruit, its food, is despicable.’

<sup>13</sup> “And you said, ‘Oh, what weariness!’ and you sneered at it,” said יהוה of hosts. “And you brought in plunder, and the lame, and the sick – thus you have brought in the offering! Should I accept this from your hand?” said יהוה.

<sup>14</sup> “But cursed be the deceiver who has a male in his flock, and makes a vow, but is slaughtering to יהוה what is blemished. For I am a great Sovereign,” said יהוה of hosts, “and My Name is feared among nations.
