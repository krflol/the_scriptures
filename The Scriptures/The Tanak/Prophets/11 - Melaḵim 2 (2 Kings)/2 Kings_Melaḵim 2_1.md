<sup>1</sup> And Mo’aḇ revolted against Yisra’ĕl after the death of Aḥaḇ.

<sup>2</sup> And Aḥazyah fell through the lattice of his upper room in Shomeron, and was injured, and sent messengers and said to them, “Go, inquire of Ba‛al-Zeḇuḇ, the mighty one of Eqron, if I shall recover from this injury.”

<sup>3</sup> But a messenger of יהוה spoke to Ĕliyah the Tishbite, “Rise up, go up to meet the messengers of the sovereign of Shomeron, and say to them, ‘Is it because there is no Elohim in Yisra’ĕl that you are going to inquire of Ba‛al-Zeḇuḇ, the mighty one of Eqron?’

<sup>4</sup> “So therefore, thus said יהוה, ‘You are not going to get out of the bed to which you have gone up, for you shall certainly die.’ ” And Ĕliyah went.

<sup>5</sup> And the messengers returned to him, and he said to them, “Why have you come back?”

<sup>6</sup> And they said to him, “A man came up to meet us, and said to us, ‘Go, return to the sovereign who sent you, and say to him, “Thus said יהוה, ‘Is it because there is no Elohim in Yisra’ĕl that you are sending to inquire of Ba‛al-Zeḇuḇ, the mighty one of Eqron? Therefore you are not going to get out of the bed to which you have gone up, for you shall certainly die.’ ” ’ ”

<sup>7</sup> And he said to them, “What was the man like who came up to meet you and spoke to you these words?”

<sup>8</sup> And they answered him, “He was a hairy man, and wore a leather girdle around his waist.” And he said, “It is Ĕliyah the Tishbite.”

<sup>9</sup> He then sent to him a captain of fifty with his fifty men. And he went up to him, and see, he was sitting on the top of a hill. And he spoke to him, “Man of Elohim, the sovereign has said, ‘Come down!’ ”

<sup>10</sup> And Ĕliyahu answered and said to the captain of fifty, “And if I am a man of Elohim, let fire come down from the heavens and consume you and your fifty men.” And fire came down from the heavens and consumed him and his fifty.

<sup>11</sup> He then sent another captain of fifty with his fifty men to him. And he answered and said to him, “Man of Elohim, this is what the sovereign said, ‘Come down at once!’ ”

<sup>12</sup> And Ĕliyah answered and said to them, “If I am a man of Elohim, let fire come down from the heavens and consume you and your fifty men.” And a fire of Elohim came down from the heavens and consumed him and his fifty.

<sup>13</sup> And again he sent a third captain of fifty with his fifty men. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Ĕliyahu, and pleaded with him, and said to him, “Man of Elohim, please let my life and the life of these fifty servants of yours be precious in your eyes.

<sup>14</sup> “See, fire has come down from the heavens and burned up the first two captains of fifties with their fifties. But let my life be precious in your eyes.”

<sup>15</sup> And the Messenger of יהוה said to Ĕliyahu, “Go down with him; do not be afraid of him.” So he rose up and went down with him to the sovereign,

<sup>16</sup> and spoke to him, “Thus said יהוה, ‘Because you have sent messengers to inquire of Ba‛al-Zeḇuḇ, the mighty one of Eqron, is it because there is no Elohim in Yisra’ĕl to inquire of His word? Therefore you are not going to get out of the bed to which you have gone up, for you shall certainly die.’ ”

<sup>17</sup> And he died, according to the word of יהוה which Ĕliyahu had spoken. And Yehoram reigned in his place, in the second year of Yehoram son of Yehoshaphat sovereign of Yehuḏah, for he had no son.

<sup>18</sup> And the rest of the acts of Aḥazyahu which he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the sovereigns of Yisra’ĕl?
