<sup>1</sup> In the second year of Yo’ash son of Yo’aḥaz, sovereign of Yisra’ĕl, Amatsyahu son of Yo’ash, sovereign of Yehuḏah, began to reign.

<sup>2</sup> He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Yerushalayim. And his mother’s name was Yeho‛addin of Yerushalayim.

<sup>3</sup> And he did what was right in the eyes of יהוה, but not like his father Dawiḏ. He did according to all his father Yo’ash did.

<sup>4</sup> However, the high places were not taken away. The people still slaughtered and burned incense on the high places.

<sup>5</sup> And it came to be, as soon as the reign was strong in his hand, that he smote his servants who had smitten his father the sovereign.

<sup>6</sup> But he did not put to death the children of the murderers, according to what is written in the Book of the Torah of Mosheh, in which יהוה commanded, saying, “Fathers are not put to death for the children, and children are not put to death for the fathers, but each one is put to death for his own sin.”

<sup>7</sup> He smote Eḏom in the Valley of Salt, ten thousand, and took Sela in battle, and called its name Yoqthe’ĕl to this day.

<sup>8</sup> Amatsyah then sent messengers to Yeho’ash son of Yeho’aḥaz, son of Yĕhu, sovereign of Yisra’ĕl, saying, “Come, let us look each other in the face!”

<sup>9</sup> And Yeho’ash sovereign of Yisra’ĕl sent to Amatsyahu sovereign of Yehuḏah, saying, “The thistle that was in Leḇanon sent to the cedar that was in Leḇanon, saying, ‘Give your daughter to my son as wife.’ And a wild beast that was in Leḇanon passed by and trampled the thistle.

<sup>10</sup> “You have certainly smitten Eḏom, and your heart has lifted you up. Be esteemed and stay in your house. But why do you stir up yourself to evil, that you should fall – you and Yehuḏah with you?”

<sup>11</sup> But Amatsyahu did not listen, so Yeho’ash sovereign of Yisra’ĕl went up, and he and Amatsyahu sovereign of Yehuḏah faced one another at Bĕyth Shemesh, which belongs to Yehuḏah.

<sup>12</sup> And Yehuḏah was smitten before Yisra’ĕl, and they each fled to his tent.

<sup>13</sup> And Yeho’ash sovereign of Yisra’ĕl caught Amatsyahu sovereign of Yehuḏah, son of Yeho’ash, son of Aḥazyahu, at Bĕyth Shemesh. And they came to Yerushalayim and he broke through the wall of Yerushalayim from the Gate of Ephrayim to the Corner Gate, four hundred cubits,

<sup>14</sup> and took all the gold and silver, and all the objects that were found in the House of יהוה and in the treasuries of the sovereign’s house, and hostages, and returned to Shomeron.

<sup>15</sup> And the rest of the acts of Yeho’ash which he did, and his might, and how he fought with Amatsyahu sovereign of Yehuḏah, are they not written in the book of the annals of the sovereigns of Yisra’ĕl?

<sup>16</sup> So Yeho’ash slept with his fathers, and was buried in Shomeron with the sovereigns of Yisra’ĕl. And Yaroḇ‛am his son reigned in his place.

<sup>17</sup> And Amatsyahu son of Yo’ash, sovereign of Yehuḏah, lived fifteen years after the death of Yeho’ash son of Yeho’aḥaz, sovereign of Yisra’ĕl.

<sup>18</sup> And the rest of the acts of Amatsyahu, are they not written in the book of the annals of the sovereigns of Yehuḏah?

<sup>19</sup> And they made a conspiracy against him in Yerushalayim, and he fled to Laḵish. And they sent after him to Laḵish and killed him there,

<sup>20</sup> and brought him on horses, and he was buried at Yerushalayim with his fathers in the City of Dawiḏ.

<sup>21</sup> And all the people of Yehuḏah took Azaryah, who was sixteen years old, and set him up to reign instead of his father Amatsyahu.

<sup>22</sup> He built Ĕylath and restored it to Yehuḏah, after the sovereign slept with his fathers.

<sup>23</sup> In the fifteenth year of Amatsyahu son of Yo’ash, the sovereign of Yehuḏah, Yaroḇ‛am son of Yo’ash, the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl, began to reign in Shomeron, and reigned forty-one years.

<sup>24</sup> And he did evil in the eyes of יהוה. He did not turn away from all the sins of Yaroḇ‛am son of Neḇat, who had made Yisra’ĕl sin.

<sup>25</sup> He restored the border of Yisra’ĕl from the entrance of Ḥamath to the Sea of the Araḇah, according to the word of יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, which He had spoken through His servant Yonah son of Amittai, the prophet who was from Gath Ḥĕpher.

<sup>26</sup> For יהוה saw that the affliction of Yisra’ĕl was very bitter. And there was no one, neither shut up nor left at large, to help Yisra’ĕl.

<sup>27</sup> And יהוה had not said that He would blot out the name of Yisra’ĕl from under the heavens, but saved them by the hand of Yaroḇ‛am son of Yo’ash.

<sup>28</sup> And the rest of the acts of Yaroḇ‛am, and all that he did, and his might, how he fought, and how he recovered Dammeseq and Ḥamath for Yehuḏah in Yisra’ĕl, are they not written in the book of the annals of the sovereigns of Yisra’ĕl?

<sup>29</sup> So Yaroḇ‛am slept with his fathers, the sovereigns of Yisra’ĕl. And Zeḵaryah his son reigned in his place.

<sup>1</sup> In the second year of Yo’ash son of Yo’aḥaz, sovereign of Yisra’ĕl, Amatsyahu son of Yo’ash, sovereign of Yehuḏah, began to reign.

<sup>2</sup> He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Yerushalayim. And his mother’s name was Yeho‛addin of Yerushalayim.
