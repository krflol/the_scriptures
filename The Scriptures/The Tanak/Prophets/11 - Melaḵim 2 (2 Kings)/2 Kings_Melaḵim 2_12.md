<sup>1</sup> Yeho’ash began to reign in the seventh year of Yĕhu, and he reigned forty years in Yerushalayim. And his mother’s name was Tsiḇyah of Be’ĕrsheḇa.

<sup>2</sup> And Yeho’ash did what was right in the eyes of יהוה all the days in which Yehoyaḏa the priest instructed him.

<sup>3</sup> However, the high places were not taken away; the people still slaughter and burned incense on the high places.

<sup>4</sup> And Yeho’ash said to the priests, “All the silver of the set-apart gifts that are brought into the House of יהוה, the silver coming over, each man’s assessment silver, all the silver that a man purposes in his heart to bring into the House of יהוה,

<sup>5</sup> let the priests take for themselves, each from his friend. And let them repair the damages of the House, wherever there is damage.”

<sup>6</sup> And it came to be, by the twenty-third year of Sovereign Yeho’ash, that the priests had not repaired the damages of the House,

<sup>7</sup> and Sovereign Yeho’ash called Yehoyaḏa the priest and the other priests, and said to them, “Why have you not repaired the damages of the House? And now, do not take any more silver from your friends, but give it for repairing the damages of the House.”

<sup>8</sup> And the priests agreed that they would neither receive any more silver from the people, nor repair the damages of the House.

<sup>9</sup> And Yehoyaḏa the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in its lid, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one comes into the House of יהוה. And the priests who guarded the door put there all the silver that was brought into the House of יהוה.

<sup>10</sup> And it came to be, whenever they saw that there was much silver in the chest, that the sovereign’s scribe and the high priest came up and put it in bags, and counted the silver that was found in the House of יהוה,

<sup>11</sup> and gave the silver, weighed out, into the hands of those who did the work, who had the oversight of the House of יהוה. And they paid it out to the carpenters and builders who worked on the House of יהוה,

<sup>12</sup> and to stonemasons and stonecutters, and for buying timber and hewn stone to repair the damage of the House of יהוה, and for all that was paid out to repair the House.

<sup>13</sup> However there were not made for the House of יהוה basins of silver, snuffers, sprinkling-bowls, trumpets, any objects of gold, or objects of silver, from the silver that was brought into the House of יהוה,

<sup>14</sup> for they gave that to the workmen, and they repaired the House of יהוה with it.

<sup>15</sup> And they did not reckon with the men into whose hand they gave the silver to be paid to workmen, for they acted trustworthily.

<sup>16</sup> The silver from the trespass offerings and the silver from the sin offerings was not brought into the House of יהוה. It belonged to the priests.

<sup>17</sup> And Ḥaza’ĕl sovereign of Aram went up and fought against Gath, and captured it. And Ḥaza’ĕl set his face to go up to Yerushalayim.

<sup>18</sup> And Yeho’ash sovereign of Yehuḏah took all the set-apart gifts that his fathers, Yehoshaphat and Yehoram and Aḥazyahu, sovereigns of Yehuḏah, had set apart, and his own set-apart gifts, and all the gold found in the treasuries of the House of יהוה and in the sovereign’s house, and sent them to Ḥaza’ĕl sovereign of Aram. Then he went away from Yerushalayim.

<sup>19</sup> And the rest of the acts of Yo’ash, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the sovereigns of Yehuḏah?

<sup>20</sup> And his servants rose up and made a conspiracy, and smote Yo’ash in the house of Millo, which goes down to Silla.

<sup>21</sup> For Yozaḵar son of Shim‛ath and Yehozaḇaḏ son of Shomĕr, his servants, smote him. So he died, and they buried him with his fathers in the City of Dawiḏ. And Amatsyah his son reigned in his place.
