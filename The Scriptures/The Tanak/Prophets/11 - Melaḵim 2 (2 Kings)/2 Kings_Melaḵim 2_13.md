<sup>1</sup> In the twenty-third year of Yo’ash son of Aḥazyahu, sovereign of Yehuḏah, Yeho’aḥaz son of Yĕhu began to reign over Yisra’ĕl in Shomeron, and reigned seventeen years.

<sup>2</sup> And he did evil in the eyes of יהוה, and followed the sins of Yaroḇ‛am son of Neḇat, who had made Yisra’ĕl sin. He did not turn away from them.

<sup>3</sup> And the displeasure of יהוה burned against Yisra’ĕl, and He gave them into the hand of Ḥaza’ĕl sovereign of Aram, and into the hand of Ben-Haḏaḏ son of Ḥaza’ĕl, all the days.

<sup>4</sup> Then Yeho’aḥaz sought the face of יהוה. And יהוה listened to him, for He saw the oppression of Yisra’ĕl, because the sovereign of Aram oppressed them.

<sup>5</sup> And יהוה gave Yisra’ĕl a saviour, so that they came out from under the hand of Aram. And the children of Yisra’ĕl dwelt in their tents as before.

<sup>6</sup> However, they did not turn away from the sins of the house of Yaroḇ‛am, who had made Yisra’ĕl sin, but walked in them. Moreover, the Ashĕrah also remained in Shomeron.

<sup>7</sup> For He left of the army of Yeho’aḥaz only fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen, for the sovereign of Aram had destroyed them and made them like the dust at threshing.

<sup>8</sup> And the rest of the acts of Yeho’aḥaz, and all that he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the annals of the sovereigns of Yisra’ĕl?

<sup>9</sup> So Yeho’aḥaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in Shomeron. And Yo’ash his son reigned in his place.

<sup>10</sup> In the thirty-seventh year of Yo’ash sovereign of Yehuḏah, Yeho’ash son of Yeho’aḥaz began to reign over Yisra’ĕl in Shomeron, sixteen years.

<sup>11</sup> And he did evil in the eyes of יהוה. He did not turn away from all the sins of Yaroḇ‛am son of Neḇat, who had made Yisra’ĕl sin – he walked in it.

<sup>12</sup> And the rest of the acts of Yo’ash, and all that he did, and his might with which he fought against Amatsyah sovereign of Yehuḏah, are they not written in the book of the annals of the sovereigns of Yisra’ĕl?

<sup>13</sup> So Yo’ash slept with his fathers. And Yaroḇ‛am sat on his throne. And Yo’ash was buried in Shomeron with the sovereigns of Yisra’ĕl.

<sup>14</sup> And Elisha had become sick with the sickness in which he died. And Yo’ash the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl came down to him, and wept over his face, and said, “O my father, my father, the chariots of Yisra’ĕl and their horsemen!”

<sup>15</sup> And Elisha said to him, “Take a bow and some arrows.” And he took a bow and some arrows.

<sup>16</sup> And he said to the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl, “Place your hand on the bow.” So he placed his hand, and Elisha placed his hands on the hands of the sovereign,

<sup>17</sup> and said, “Open the east window.” And he had opened it and Elisha said, “Shoot.” And he shot. Then he said, “The arrow of deliverance of יהוה and the arrow of deliverance from Aram, for you shall smite Aram at Aphĕq until it is finished.”

<sup>18</sup> Then he said, “Take the arrows,” and he took them. And he said to the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl, “Strike the ground,” and he struck three times, and stopped.

<sup>19</sup> And the man of Elohim was wroth with him and said, “You should have smitten five or six times, then you would have smitten Aram till its utter destruction. But now you shall smite Aram only three times.”

<sup>20</sup> And Elisha died, and they buried him. And the raiding bands from Mo’aḇ came into the land in the spring of the year.

<sup>21</sup> And it came to be, they were burying a man, and there they saw a raiding band, and cast the man in the tomb of Elisha. And the man fell and touched the bones of Elisha, and came to life and stood on his feet.

<sup>22</sup> And Ḥaza’ĕl sovereign of Aram oppressed Yisra’ĕl all the days of Yeho’aḥaz.

<sup>23</sup> But יהוה showed favour to them, and had compassion on them, and turned toward them, for the sake of His covenant with Aḇraham, Yitsḥaq, and Ya‛aqoḇ, and would not destroy them or cast them from His presence as yet.

<sup>24</sup> And Ḥaza’ĕl sovereign of Aram died. And Ben-Haḏaḏ his son reigned in his place.

<sup>25</sup> And Yeho’ash son of Yeho’aḥaz recovered from the hand of Ben-Haḏaḏ, son of Ḥaza’ĕl, the cities which he had taken out of the hand of Yeho’aḥaz his father in battle. Yo’ash smote him three times, and he recovered the cities of Yisra’ĕl.
