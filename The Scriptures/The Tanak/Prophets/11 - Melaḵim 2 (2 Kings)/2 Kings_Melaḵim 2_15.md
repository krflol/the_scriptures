<sup>19</sup> Pul the sovereign of Ashshur came against the land. And Menaḥĕm gave Pul a thousand talents of silver, for his hand to be with him to strengthen the reign in his hand.

<sup>20</sup> And Menaḥĕm exacted the silver of Yisra’ĕl, of all the mighty men of wealth, of each man fifty sheqels of silver, to give to the sovereign of Ashshur. And the sovereign of Ashshur turned back, and did not stay there in the land.

<sup>21</sup> And the rest of the acts of Menaḥĕm, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the sovereigns of Yisra’ĕl?

<sup>22</sup> So Menaḥĕm slept with his fathers. And Peqaḥyah his son reigned in his place.

<sup>23</sup> In the fiftieth year of Azaryah the sovereign of Yehuḏah, Peqaḥyah the son of Menaḥĕm began to reign over Yisra’ĕl in Shomeron, for two years.

<sup>24</sup> And he did evil in the eyes of יהוה. He did not turn away from the sins of Yaroḇ‛am son of Neḇat, who had made Yisra’ĕl sin.

<sup>25</sup> And Peqaḥ son of Remalyahu, a chief officer of his, conspired against him and smote him in Shomeron, in the high place of the sovereign’s house, along with Argoḇ and Aryĕh, and with him were fifty men of Gil‛aḏ. So he killed him and reigned in his place.
