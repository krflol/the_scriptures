<sup>1</sup> And Elisha spoke to the woman whose son he had restored to life, saying, “Rise up and go, you and your household, and sojourn wherever you do sojourn, for יהוה has called for a scarcity of food, and also, it is coming upon the land for seven years.”

<sup>2</sup> And the woman rose up and did according to the word of the man of Elohim, and she went with her household and sojourned in the land of the Philistines, seven years.

<sup>3</sup> And it came to be, at the end of seven years, that the woman returned from the land of the Philistines. And she went to cry out to the sovereign for her house and for her land.

<sup>4</sup> And the sovereign was speaking to Gĕḥazi, the servant of the man of Elohim, saying, “Please relate to me all the great matters Elisha has done.”

<sup>5</sup> And it came to be, as he was relating to the sovereign how he had restored the dead to life, that see, the woman whose son he had restored to life, was crying out to the sovereign for her house and for her land. And Gĕḥazi said, “My master, O sovereign, this is the woman, and this is her son whom Elisha restored to life.”

<sup>6</sup> So the sovereign asked the woman, and she related to him. And the sovereign appointed a certain eunuch for her, saying, “Return all that was hers, and all the increase of the field from the day that she left the land until now.”

<sup>7</sup> And Elisha came to Dammeseq, and Ben-Haḏaḏ sovereign of Aram was sick. And it was reported to him, saying, “The man of Elohim has come here.”

<sup>8</sup> And the sovereign said to Ḥaza’ĕl, “Take a present in your hand, and go to meet the man of Elohim, and inquire of יהוה by him, saying, ‘Do I recover from this sickness?’ ”

<sup>9</sup> And Ḥaza’ĕl went to meet him and took a present with him, of all the good wares of Dammeseq, forty camel-loads. And he came and stood before him, and said, “Your son Ben-Haḏaḏ sovereign of Aram has sent me to you, saying, ‘Do I recover from this sickness?’ ”

<sup>10</sup> And Elisha said to him, “Go, say to him, ‘You shall certainly recover.’ But יהוה has shown me that he shall certainly die.”

<sup>11</sup> And he looked at him steadily until he was ashamed. Then the man of Elohim wept.

<sup>12</sup> And Ḥaza’ĕl said, “Why is my master weeping?” And he answered, “Because I know the evil that you are going to do to the children of Yisra’ĕl: Setting their strongholds on fire, and slaying their young men with the sword, and dashing their children, and ripping open their women with child.”

<sup>13</sup> And Ḥaza’ĕl said, “But what is your servant – a dog, that he should perform this great matter?” And Elisha answered, “ יהוה has shown that you are to be sovereign over Aram!”

<sup>14</sup> And he left Elisha, and came to his master, who said to him, “What did Elisha say to you?” And he answered, “He said to me that you shall certainly recover.”

<sup>15</sup> And on the next day it came to be that he took a thick cloth and dipped it in water, and spread it over his face so that he died. And Ḥaza’ĕl reigned in his place.

<sup>16</sup> And in the fifth year of Yehoram son of Aḥaḇ sovereign of Yisra’ĕl – Yehoshaphat was sovereign of Yehuḏah – Yehoram son of Yehoshaphat began to reign as sovereign of Yehuḏah.

<sup>17</sup> He was thirty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Yerushalayim.

<sup>18</sup> And he walked in the way of the sovereigns of Yisra’ĕl, as the house of Aḥaḇ had done, for the daughter of Aḥaḇ was his wife. And he did evil in the eyes of יהוה.

<sup>19</sup> However, יהוה would not destroy Yehuḏah, for the sake of Dawiḏ His servant, as He promised him to give a lamp to him and his sons forever.

<sup>20</sup> In his days Eḏom revolted from under the hand of Yehuḏah, and made a sovereign over themselves.

<sup>21</sup> And Yoram passed over to Tsa‛ir, and all his chariots with him. And he rose by night and smote the Eḏomites who had surrounded him and the commanders of the chariots, but his people fled to their tents.

<sup>22</sup> Yet Eḏom has been in revolt from under the hand of Yehuḏah to this day. Then Liḇnah revolted at the same time.

<sup>23</sup> And the rest of the acts of Yoram, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the sovereigns of Yehuḏah?

<sup>24</sup> So Yoram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the City of Dawiḏ. And Aḥazyahu his son reigned in his place.

<sup>25</sup> In the twelfth year of Yoram son of Aḥaḇ sovereign of Yisra’ĕl, Aḥazyahu son of Yehoram sovereign of Yehuḏah began to reign.

<sup>26</sup> Aḥazyahu was twenty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Yerushalayim. And the name of his mother was Athalyahu, the granddaughter of Omri, sovereign of Yisra’ĕl.

<sup>27</sup> And he walked in the way of the house of Aḥaḇ, and did evil in the eyes of יהוה, as the house of Aḥaḇ had done, for he was the son-in-law of the house of Aḥaḇ.

<sup>28</sup> And he went with Yoram son of Aḥaḇ to battle against Ḥaza’ĕl sovereign of Aram at Ramoth Gil‛aḏ, and the Arameans smote Yoram.

<sup>29</sup> And Sovereign Yoram went back to Yizre‛ĕl to recover from the wounds with which the Arameans had smitten him at Ramah, when he fought against Ḥaza’ĕl sovereign of Aram. Then Aḥazyahu son of Yehoram, the sovereign of Yehuḏah, went down to see Yoram son of Aḥaḇ in Yizre‛ĕl, for he was sick.

<sup>1</sup> And Elisha spoke to the woman whose son he had restored to life, saying, “Rise up and go, you and your household, and sojourn wherever you do sojourn, for יהוה has called for a scarcity of food, and also, it is coming upon the land for seven years.”

<sup>2</sup> And the woman rose up and did according to the word of the man of Elohim, and she went with her household and sojourned in the land of the Philistines, seven years.

<sup>3</sup> And it came to be, at the end of seven years, that the woman returned from the land of the Philistines. And she went to cry out to the sovereign for her house and for her land.

<sup>4</sup> And the sovereign was speaking to Gĕḥazi, the servant of the man of Elohim, saying, “Please relate to me all the great matters Elisha has done.”

<sup>5</sup> And it came to be, as he was relating to the sovereign how he had restored the dead to life, that see, the woman whose son he had restored to life, was crying out to the sovereign for her house and for her land. And Gĕḥazi said, “My master, O sovereign, this is the woman, and this is her son whom Elisha restored to life.”

<sup>6</sup> So the sovereign asked the woman, and she related to him. And the sovereign appointed a certain eunuch for her, saying, “Return all that was hers, and all the increase of the field from the day that she left the land until now.”

<sup>7</sup> And Elisha came to Dammeseq, and Ben-Haḏaḏ sovereign of Aram was sick. And it was reported to him, saying, “The man of Elohim has come here.”

<sup>8</sup> And the sovereign said to Ḥaza’ĕl, “Take a present in your hand, and go to meet the man of Elohim, and inquire of יהוה by him, saying, ‘Do I recover from this sickness?’ ”

<sup>9</sup> And Ḥaza’ĕl went to meet him and took a present with him, of all the good wares of Dammeseq, forty camel-loads. And he came and stood before him, and said, “Your son Ben-Haḏaḏ sovereign of Aram has sent me to you, saying, ‘Do I recover from this sickness?’ ”

<sup>14</sup> And he left Elisha, and came to his master, who said to him, “What did Elisha say to you?” And he answered, “He said to me that you shall certainly recover.”

<sup>15</sup> And on the next day it came to be that he took a thick cloth and dipped it in water, and spread it over his face so that he died. And Ḥaza’ĕl reigned in his place.

<sup>16</sup> And in the fifth year of Yehoram son of Aḥaḇ sovereign of Yisra’ĕl – Yehoshaphat was sovereign of Yehuḏah – Yehoram son of Yehoshaphat began to reign as sovereign of Yehuḏah.

<sup>17</sup> He was thirty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Yerushalayim.
