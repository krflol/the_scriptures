<sup>1</sup> Yoshiyahu was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned thirty-one years in Yerushalayim. And his mother’s name was Yeḏiḏah the daughter of Aḏayah of Botsqath.

<sup>2</sup> And he did what was right in the eyes of יהוה, and walked in all the ways of his father Dawiḏ, and did not turn aside, right or left.

<sup>3</sup> And it came to be, in the eighteenth year of Sovereign Yoshiyahu, that the sovereign sent Shaphan the scribe, son of Atsalyahu, son of Meshullam, to the House of יהוה, saying,

<sup>4</sup> “Go up to Ḥilqiyahu the high priest, and let him weigh the silver which has been brought into the House of יהוה, which the doorkeepers have gathered from the people.

<sup>5</sup> “And let them give it into the hand of those doing the work, who are the overseers in the House of יהוה. And let them give it to those who are in the House of יהוה doing the work, to repair the damages of the house,

<sup>6</sup> to carpenters and to builders and to stonemasons, and to buy timber and hewn stone to repair the house.

<sup>7</sup> “However, let not the silver given into their hand be reckoned with them, for they are acting trustworthily.”

<sup>8</sup> And Ḥilqiyahu the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe, “I have found the Book of the Torah in the House of יהוה.” And Ḥilqiyah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it.

<sup>9</sup> And Shaphan the scribe came to the sovereign, and brought word to the sovereign again, saying, “Your servants have gathered the silver that was found in the house, and have given it into the hand of those who do the work, who oversee the House of יהוה.”

<sup>10</sup> And Shaphan the scribe informed the sovereign, saying, “Ḥilqiyah the priest has given me a book.” And Shaphan read it before the sovereign.

<sup>11</sup> And it came to be, when the sovereign heard the words of the Book of the Torah, that he tore his garments,

<sup>12</sup> and the sovereign commanded Ḥilqiyah the priest, and Aḥiqam son of Shaphan, and Aḵbor son of Miḵayah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asayah a servant of the sovereign, saying,

<sup>13</sup> “Go, inquire of יהוה for me, for the people and for all Yehuḏah, concerning the words of this book that has been found. For great is the wrath of יהוה that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not obeyed the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.”

<sup>14</sup> Then Ḥilqiyahu the priest, and Aḥiqam, and Aḵbor, and Shaphan, and Asayah went to Ḥuldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum son of Tiqwah, son of Ḥarḥas, keeper of the wardrobe. Now she was dwelling in Yerushalayim in the Second Quarter. And they spoke with her.

<sup>15</sup> And she said to them, “Thus said יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, ‘Say to the man who sent you to Me,

<sup>16</sup> “Thus said יהוה, ‘See, I am bringing evil on this place and on its inhabitants, all the words of the book which the sovereign of Yehuḏah has read,

<sup>17</sup> because they have forsaken Me and burned incense to other mighty ones to provoke Me with all the works of their hands. And so My wrath shall be kindled against this place and not be quenched.’ ” ’

<sup>18</sup> “And to the sovereign of Yehuḏah, who sent you to inquire of יהוה, say this to him, ‘Thus said יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, “As for the words which you have heard,

<sup>19</sup> because your heart was tender, and you humbled yourself before יהוה when you heard what I spoke against this place and against its inhabitants, that they would become a ruin and a curse, and did tore your garments and wept before Me, I also have heard,” declares יהוה.

<sup>20</sup> “Therefore, see, I am gathering you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace, so that your eyes do not see all the evil I am bringing on this place.” ’ ” And they brought word to the sovereign.
