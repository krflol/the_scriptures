<sup>1</sup> And Athalyah was the mother of Aḥazyahu. And when she saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the offspring of the reign.

<sup>2</sup> But Yehosheḇa, the daughter of Sovereign Yoram, sister of Aḥazyahu, took Yo’ash son of Aḥazyah, and stole him away from among the sons of the sovereign’s sons who were put to death. So they hid him and his nurse in the bedroom, from Athalyahu, and he was not put to death.

<sup>3</sup> And he remained with her in hiding in the House of יהוה for six years, while Athalyah was reigning over the land.

<sup>4</sup> And in the seventh year Yehoyaḏa sent and brought the commanders of hundreds, with the Karites and the runners, and brought them into the House of יהוה to him. And he made a covenant with them and took an oath from them in the House of יהוה, and showed them the son of the sovereign.

<sup>5</sup> And he commanded them, saying, “This is what you are to do: One-third of you who come in on the Sabbath to be on guard in the sovereign’s house,

<sup>6</sup> and one-third at the gate of Sur, and one-third at the gate behind the runners. And you shall be on guard in the house, lest it be broken down.

<sup>7</sup> “And the two detachments of you who are going out on the Sabbath shall be on guard in the House of יהוה for the sovereign.

<sup>8</sup> “And you shall surround the sovereign on all sides, every man with his weapons in his hand. And whoever comes within the ranks, let him be put to death. And be with the sovereign as he goes out and as he comes in.”

<sup>9</sup> So the commanders of the hundreds did according to all that Yehoyaḏa the priest commanded. And each of them took his men who were going in on the Sabbath, with those who were going out on the Sabbath, and came to Yehoyaḏa the priest.

<sup>10</sup> And the priest gave the commanders of hundreds the spears and shields which had belonged to Sovereign Dawiḏ, that were in the House of יהוה.

<sup>11</sup> And the runners stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, all around the sovereign, from the right side of the House to the left side of the House, by the altar and the House.

<sup>12</sup> And he brought out the son of the sovereign and put on him the diadem and the Witness. And they set him up to reign and anointed him, and they clapped their hands and said, “Let the sovereign live!”

<sup>13</sup> And Athalyah heard the noise of the runners, the people, and she came to the people, into the House of יהוה,

<sup>14</sup> and looked and saw the sovereign standing by a column, according to the ruling, and the chiefs and the trumpeters were beside the sovereign, and all the people of the land rejoicing and blowing trumpets. And Athalyah tore her garments and cried out, “Treason! Treason!”

<sup>15</sup> And Yehoyaḏa the priest commanded the commanders of the hundreds, the officers of the army, and said to them, “Take her outside the ranks, and slay with the sword whoever follows her.” For the priest had said, “Do not let her be killed in the House of יהוה.”

<sup>16</sup> So they took hold of her, and she went by way of the horses’ entrance to the sovereign’s house, and was put to death there.

<sup>17</sup> And Yehoyaḏa made a covenant between יהוה and the sovereign and the people, to be the people of יהוה – also between the sovereign and the people.

<sup>18</sup> And all the people of the land went to the house of Ba‛al, and broke it down. They completely broke up its altars and images, and slew Mattan the priest of Ba‛al before the altars. And the priest appointed inspectors over the House of יהוה,

<sup>19</sup> and took the commanders of hundreds, and the Karites, and the runners, and all the people of the land. And they brought the sovereign down from the House of יהוה, and went by way of the gate of the runners to the sovereign’s house. And he sat on the throne of the sovereigns.

<sup>20</sup> And all the people of the land rejoiced. And the city had rest, for they had slain Athalyahu with the sword in the sovereign’s house.

<sup>21</sup> Yeho’ash was seven years old when he began to reign.

<sup>1</sup> And Athalyah was the mother of Aḥazyahu. And when she saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the offspring of the reign.

<sup>2</sup> But Yehosheḇa, the daughter of Sovereign Yoram, sister of Aḥazyahu, took Yo’ash son of Aḥazyah, and stole him away from among the sons of the sovereign’s sons who were put to death. So they hid him and his nurse in the bedroom, from Athalyahu, and he was not put to death.

<sup>7</sup> “And the two detachments of you who are going out on the Sabbath shall be on guard in the House of יהוה for the sovereign.

<sup>8</sup> “And you shall surround the sovereign on all sides, every man with his weapons in his hand. And whoever comes within the ranks, let him be put to death. And be with the sovereign as he goes out and as he comes in.”

<sup>9</sup> So the commanders of the hundreds did according to all that Yehoyaḏa the priest commanded. And each of them took his men who were going in on the Sabbath, with those who were going out on the Sabbath, and came to Yehoyaḏa the priest.

<sup>10</sup> And the priest gave the commanders of hundreds the spears and shields which had belonged to Sovereign Dawiḏ, that were in the House of יהוה.

<sup>20</sup> And all the people of the land rejoiced. And the city had rest, for they had slain Athalyahu with the sword in the sovereign’s house.

<sup>21</sup> Yeho’ash was seven years old when he began to reign.
