<sup>1</sup> And Dawiḏ went from there and escaped to the cave of Aḏullam. And his brothers and all his father’s house heard it, and went down to him there.

<sup>2</sup> And everyone who was in distress, everyone who was in debt, and everyone bitter in being gathered to him. So he became head over them, and there were about four hundred men with him.

<sup>3</sup> And Dawiḏ went from there to Mitspeh of Mo’aḇ and said to the sovereign of Mo’aḇ, “Please let my father and mother come here with you, till I know what Elohim does for me.”

<sup>4</sup> And he left them with the sovereign of Mo’aḇ, and they dwelt with him all the time that Dawiḏ was in the stronghold.

<sup>5</sup> And the prophet Gaḏ said to Dawiḏ, “Do not remain in the stronghold. Leave, and go to the land of Yehuḏah.” So Dawiḏ left and went into the Ḥereth woods.

<sup>6</sup> And Sha’ul heard that Dawiḏ and the men who were with him had been discovered, while Sha’ul was in Giḇ‛ah, sitting under a tamarisk tree in Ramah, with his spear in his hand, and all his servants standing about him.

<sup>7</sup> And Sha’ul said to his servants who were standing around him, “Hear now, you Binyamites! Does the son of Yishai give every one of you fields and vineyards, and make you all commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds?

<sup>8</sup> “For all of you have conspired against me, and there is no one who reveals to me that my son has made a covenant with the son of Yishai. And there is not one of you who is grieved for me or reveals to me that my son has stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as it is this day.”

<sup>9</sup> And Do’ĕḡ the Eḏomite, who was set over the servants of Sha’ul, answered and said, “I saw the son of Yishai going to Noḇ, to Aḥimeleḵ son of Aḥituḇ.

<sup>10</sup> “And he inquired of יהוה for him, gave him food, and gave him the sword of Golyath the Philistine.”

<sup>11</sup> And the sovereign sent someone to call Aḥimeleḵ the priest, son of Aḥituḇ, and all his father’s house, the priests who were in Noḇ. And they all came to the sovereign,

<sup>12</sup> and Sha’ul said, “Hear now, son of Aḥituḇ!” And he answered, “Here I am, my master.”

<sup>13</sup> And Sha’ul said to him, “Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Yishai, by giving him bread and a sword, and have inquired of Elohim for him, to rise against me, to lie in wait, as it is this day?”

<sup>14</sup> And Aḥimeleḵ answered the sovereign and said, “And who among all your servants is so trustworthy as Dawiḏ, who is the sovereign’s son-in-law, and has turned aside to your counsel, and is esteemed in your house?

<sup>15</sup> “Have I today begun to inquire of Elohim for him? Far be it from me! Let not the sovereign lay a case against his servant, or against any in the house of my father. For your servant knew not of all this, little or much.”

<sup>16</sup> And the sovereign said, “You shall certainly die, Aḥimeleḵ, you and all your father’s house!”

<sup>17</sup> The sovereign then said to the guards who stood about him, “Turn and put the priests of יהוה to death, because their hand also is with Dawiḏ, and because they knew when he fled and did not reveal it to me.” But the servants of the sovereign would not lift their hands to come against the priests of יהוה.

<sup>18</sup> And the sovereign said to Do’ĕḡ, “You turn and come against the priests!” So Do’ĕḡ the Eḏomite turned and came against the priests, and put to death on that day eighty-five men who wore a linen shoulder garment.

<sup>19</sup> And he smote Noḇ, the city of the priests, with the edge of the sword, from men even to women, from children even to nursing infants, and oxen and donkeys and sheep, with the edge of the sword.

<sup>20</sup> And one of the sons of Aḥimeleḵ son of Aḥituḇ, named Eḇyathar, escaped and fled after Dawiḏ.

<sup>21</sup> And Eḇyathar reported to Dawiḏ that Sha’ul had slain the priests of יהוה.

<sup>22</sup> And Dawiḏ said to Eḇyathar, “I knew that day, when Do’ĕḡ the Eḏomite was there, that he would certainly inform Sha’ul. I am accountable for all the lives of your father’s house.

<sup>23</sup> “Remain with me, do not fear. For he who seeks my life seeks your life, but with me you are safe.”

<sup>1</sup> And Dawiḏ went from there and escaped to the cave of Aḏullam. And his brothers and all his father’s house heard it, and went down to him there.
