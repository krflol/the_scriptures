<sup>1</sup> And it came to be, when Shemu’ĕl was old, that he made his sons rulers over Yisra’ĕl.

<sup>2</sup> And the name of his first-born was Yo’ĕl, and the name of his second, Aḇiyah, rulers in Be’ĕrsheḇa.

<sup>3</sup> But his sons did not walk in his ways, and turned aside after own gain, and took bribes, and twisted right-ruling.

<sup>4</sup> And all the elders of Yisra’ĕl gathered together and came to Shemu’ĕl at Ramah,

<sup>5</sup> and said to him, “Look, you are old, and your sons do not walk in your ways. Now appoint for us a sovereign to rule us like all the nations.”

<sup>6</sup> But the word was evil in the eyes of Shemu’ĕl when they said, “Give us a sovereign to rule us.” So Shemu’ĕl prayed to יהוה.

<sup>7</sup> And יהוה said to Shemu’ĕl, “Listen to the voice of the people in all that they say to you, for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected Me from reigning over them.

<sup>8</sup> “According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Mitsrayim, even to this day – forsaking Me and serving other mighty ones – so they are doing to you too.

<sup>9</sup> “And now, listen to their voice, but you shall certainly warn them, and shall make known to them the ruling of the sovereign who does reign over them.”

<sup>10</sup> And Shemu’ĕl spoke all the words of יהוה to the people who asked him for a sovereign,

<sup>11</sup> and said, “This is the ruling of the sovereign who does reign over you: He shall take your sons and appoint them for his own chariots and to be his horsemen, and they shall run before his chariots,

<sup>12</sup> and appoint commanders over his thousands and commanders over his fifties, or to plough his ground and reap his harvest, or to make his weapons, and equipment for his chariots.

<sup>13</sup> “And your daughters he is going to take to be perfumers, and cooks, and bakers.

<sup>14</sup> “And the best of your fields, and your vineyards, and your olive-trees he is going to take and give them to his servants.

<sup>15</sup> “And a tenth of your grain and your vintage he is going to take and give it to his officers and servants.

<sup>16</sup> “And your male servants and your female servants and your best young men and your donkeys he is going to take and use for his own work.

<sup>17</sup> “A tenth of your sheep he is going to take, and you are to be his servants.

<sup>18</sup> “And you shall cry out in that day because of your sovereign whom you have chosen for yourselves, but יהוה is not going to answer you in that day.”

<sup>19</sup> However, the people refused to listen to the voice of Shemu’ĕl, and said, “No, but let a sovereign be over us.

<sup>20</sup> Then we shall be, we also, like all the nations, and our sovereign shall rule us and go out before us and fight our battles.”

<sup>21</sup> And Shemu’ĕl heard all the words of the people, and he repeated them in the hearing of יהוה.

<sup>22</sup> And יהוה said to Shemu’ĕl, “Listen to their voice, and make them a sovereign.” And Shemu’ĕl said to the men of Yisra’ĕl, “Each of you go to his city.”
