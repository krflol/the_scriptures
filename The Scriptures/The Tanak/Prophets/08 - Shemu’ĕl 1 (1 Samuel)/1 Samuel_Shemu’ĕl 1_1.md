<sup>1</sup> And there was a certain man of Ramathayim Tsophim, of the mountains of Ephrayim, and his name was Elqanah son of Yeroḥam, son of Elihu, son of Tohu, son of Tsuph, an Ephrayimite.

<sup>2</sup> And he had two wives, the name of one was Ḥannah, and the name of the other Peninnah. And Peninnah had children, but Ḥannah had no children.

<sup>3</sup> Now this man went up from his city year by year to worship and to slaughter to יהוה of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Ĕli, Ḥophni and Pineḥas, the priests of יהוה, were there.

<sup>4</sup> And when the day came for Elqanah to make an offering, he gave portions to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and daughters,

<sup>5</sup> but, although he loved Ḥannah, he gave only one portion to Ḥannah, because יהוה had shut up her womb.

<sup>6</sup> Moreover, her rival also provoked her greatly, to make her irritable, because יהוה had shut up her womb.

<sup>7</sup> And so he did, year by year. Whenever she went up to the House of יהוה, she was provoked, so that she wept and did not eat.

<sup>8</sup> And her husband Elqanah said to her, “Ḥannah, why do you weep? Why do you not eat? And why is your heart sad? Am I not better to you than ten sons?”

<sup>9</sup> And Ḥannah rose up after eating and drinking in Shiloh, while Ĕli the priest was sitting on the seat by the doorpost of the Hĕḵal of יהוה.

<sup>10</sup> And she was bitter in life, and prayed to יהוה and wept greatly.

<sup>11</sup> And she made a vow and said, “O יהוה of hosts, if You would indeed look on the affliction of your female servant and remember me, and not forget your female servant, but shall give your female servant a male child, then I shall give him to יהוה all the days of his life, and let no razor come upon his head.”

<sup>12</sup> And it came to be, as she kept on praying before יהוה, that Ĕli was watching her mouth.

<sup>13</sup> And Ḥannah spoke in her heart, only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard. So Ĕli thought she was drunk.

<sup>14</sup> Then Ĕli said to her, “How long are you going to be drunk? Put your wine away from you!”

<sup>15</sup> And Ḥannah answered and said, “No, my master, I am a woman pained in spirit. And I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my being before יהוה.

<sup>16</sup> “Do not take your female servant for a daughter of Beliya‛al, for it is out of my great concern and provocation that I have spoken until now.”

<sup>17</sup> And Ĕli answered and said, “Go in peace, and the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl give you your petition which you have asked of Him.”

<sup>18</sup> And she said, “Let your female servant find favour in your eyes.” And the woman went her way and ate, and her face was no more sad.

<sup>19</sup> And they rose up early in the morning and worshipped before יהוה, and returned and came to their house at Ramah. And Elqanah knew Ḥannah his wife, and יהוה remembered her.

<sup>20</sup> And it came to be at the turn of days, that Ḥannah conceived and bore a son, and called his name Shemu’ĕl, “Because I have asked יהוה for him.”

<sup>21</sup> And the man Elqanah and all his house went up to offer to יהוה the yearly slaughtering and his vow.

<sup>22</sup> But Ḥannah did not go up, for she said to her husband, “When the child is weaned, then I shall take him. And he shall appear before יהוה and remain forever there.”

<sup>23</sup> And her husband Elqanah said to her, “Do what is good in your eyes. Remain until you have weaned him. Only let יהוה establish His word.” And the woman remained and nursed her son until she had weaned him.

<sup>24</sup> And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bulls, and one ĕphah of flour, and a skin of wine, and brought him to the House of יהוה in Shiloh. And the child was young.

<sup>25</sup> And they slaughtered a bull, and brought the child to Ĕli.

<sup>26</sup> And she said, “O my master! As your being lives, my master, I am the woman who stood by you here, praying to יהוה.

<sup>27</sup> “I prayed for this youth, and יהוה has granted me what I asked of Him.

<sup>28</sup> “So I have also loaned him to יהוה. All the days that he lives he shall be loaned to יהוה.” And he worshipped there before יהוה.
