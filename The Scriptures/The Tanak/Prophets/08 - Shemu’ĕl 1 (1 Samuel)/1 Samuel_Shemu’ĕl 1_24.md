<sup>1</sup> And it came to be, when Sha’ul had returned from pursuing the Philistines, that it was reported to him, saying, “See, Dawiḏ is in the Wilderness of Ĕn Geḏi.”

<sup>2</sup> So Sha’ul took three thousand chosen men from all Yisra’ĕl, and went to seek Dawiḏ and his men on the Rocks of the Wild Goats.

<sup>3</sup> And he came to the sheepfolds, on the way, and there was a cave. And Sha’ul went in to relieve himself. Now Dawiḏ and his men were sitting in the sides of the cave.

<sup>4</sup> And the men of Dawiḏ said to him, “See, the day of which יהוה said to you, ‘See, I am giving your enemy into your hand, and you shall do to him as it seems good to you!’ ” And Dawiḏ arose and gently cut off a corner of Sha’ul’s robe.

<sup>5</sup> And it came to be afterward that the heart of Dawiḏ smote him because he had cut the robe of Sha’ul.

<sup>6</sup> So he said to his men, “Far be it from me, by יהוה, that I should do this matter to my master, anointed of יהוה, to stretch out my hand against him, for he is the anointed of יהוה.”

<sup>7</sup> And Dawiḏ dispersed his servants with words, and did not allow them to rise against Sha’ul. And Sha’ul rose up from the cave and went on his way.

<sup>8</sup> And afterward Dawiḏ arose and went out of the cave, and called out to Sha’ul, saying, “My master the sovereign!” And when Sha’ul looked behind him, Dawiḏ bowed with his face to the earth, and did obeisance.

<sup>9</sup> And Dawiḏ said to Sha’ul, “Why do you listen to the words of men who say, ‘See, Dawiḏ seeks to do you evil’?

<sup>10</sup> “See, this day your eyes have seen that יהוה gave you today into my hand in the cave, and one said to slay you. But my eye pardoned you, and I said, ‘I do not stretch out my hand against my master, for he is the anointed of יהוה.’

<sup>11</sup> “And my father, see! Yea, see the corner of your robe in my hand! For in that I cut off the corner of your robe, and did not slay you, know and see that there is neither evil nor rebellion in my hand, and I have not sinned against you, while you are hunting my life to take it.

<sup>12</sup> “Let יהוה judge between you and me, and let יהוה revenge me on you, but my hand is not against you.

<sup>13</sup> “As the proverb of the ancients says, ‘Wrong comes from the wrongdoer.’ But my hand is not against you.

<sup>14</sup> “After whom has the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl come out? Whom do you pursue? A dead dog? A flea?

<sup>15</sup> “And יהוה shall be judge, and rightly rule between you and me, and see and plead my case, and rightly rule me out of your hand.”

<sup>16</sup> And it came to be, when Dawiḏ had ended speaking these words to Sha’ul, that Sha’ul said, “Is this your voice, my son Dawiḏ?” So Sha’ul lifted up his voice and wept.

<sup>17</sup> And he said to Dawiḏ, “You are more righteous than I, for you have rewarded me with good, whereas I have rewarded you with evil.

<sup>18</sup> “And you have shown today how you have done good to me, for when יהוה surrendered me into your hand you did not slay me.

<sup>19</sup> “For if a man finds his enemy, shall he let him get away safely? And let יהוה reward you with good for what you have done to me today.

<sup>20</sup> “And now look, I know that you shall certainly reign, and that the reign of Yisra’ĕl shall be established in your hand.

<sup>21</sup> “And now, swear to me by יהוה that you do not cut off my seed after me, nor destroy my name from my father’s house.”

<sup>22</sup> And Dawiḏ swore to Sha’ul. Then Sha’ul went home, and Dawiḏ and his men went up to the stronghold.
