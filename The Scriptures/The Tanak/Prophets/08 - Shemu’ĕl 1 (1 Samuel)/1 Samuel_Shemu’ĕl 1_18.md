<sup>1</sup> And it came to be, when he had ended speaking to Sha’ul, that the being of Yehonathan was knit to the being of Dawiḏ, and Yehonathan loved him as his own being.

<sup>2</sup> And Sha’ul took him that day, and would not let him return to his father’s house any more.

<sup>3</sup> And Yehonathan and Dawiḏ made a covenant, because he loved him as his own being.

<sup>4</sup> And Yehonathan took off the robe that was on him and gave it to Dawiḏ, and his garments, even to his sword and his bow and his girdle.

<sup>5</sup> And Dawiḏ went out wherever Sha’ul sent him. He acted wisely, and Sha’ul set him over the men of battle, and it was right in the eyes of all the people and also in the eyes of Sha’ul’s servants.

<sup>6</sup> And it came to be, as they came in, as Dawiḏ was returning from smiting the Philistine, that the women came out from all the cities of Yisra’ĕl, singing and dancing, to meet Sha’ul the sovereign with tambourines, with joy, and with musical instruments.

<sup>7</sup> And the women sang as they danced, and said, “Sha’ul smote his thousands, and Dawiḏ his ten thousands.”

<sup>8</sup> And Sha’ul was very wroth, and this matter was evil in his eyes, and he said, “To Dawiḏ they have given ten thousands, and to me they have given thousands. So what more for him, except the reign?”

<sup>9</sup> And from that day on Sha’ul eyed Dawiḏ.

<sup>10</sup> And it came to be on the next day that an evil spirit from Elohim came upon Sha’ul, and he prophesied inside the house, while Dawiḏ was playing the lyre with his hand, as usual. And the spear was in the hand of Sha’ul.

<sup>11</sup> Then Sha’ul hurled the spear, for he said, “Let me smite Dawiḏ, even to the wall.” But twice Dawiḏ withdrew from his presence.

<sup>12</sup> And Sha’ul was afraid of Dawiḏ, because יהוה was with him, but from Sha’ul He had turned away.

<sup>13</sup> Sha’ul therefore removed him from his presence, and made him his commander over a thousand. And he went out and came in before the people.

<sup>14</sup> And Dawiḏ was acting wisely in all his ways, and יהוה was with him.

<sup>15</sup> And Sha’ul saw that he was acting very wisely, and was afraid of him.

<sup>16</sup> But all Yisra’ĕl and Yehuḏah loved Dawiḏ, as he went out and came in before them.

<sup>17</sup> And Sha’ul said to Dawiḏ, “See my older daughter Mĕraḇ! I give her to you as a wife. Only be brave for me, and fight the battles of יהוה.” For Sha’ul thought, “Let not my hand be against him, but let the hand of the Philistines be against him.”

<sup>18</sup> And Dawiḏ said to Sha’ul, “Who am I, and what is my life or my father’s clan in Yisra’ĕl, that I should be son-in-law to the sovereign?”

<sup>19</sup> And it came to be at the time when Mĕraḇ, Sha’ul’s daughter, should have been given to Dawiḏ, that she was given to Aḏri’ĕl the Meḥolathite as a wife.

<sup>20</sup> And Miḵal, Sha’ul’s daughter, loved Dawiḏ. And they told Sha’ul, and the matter was right in his eyes.

<sup>21</sup> And Sha’ul said, “Let me give her to him and let her be a snare to him, and the hand of the Philistines be against him.” So Sha’ul said to Dawiḏ a second time, “Become my son-in-law today.”

<sup>22</sup> And Sha’ul commanded his servants, “Speak to Dawiḏ gently, and say, ‘See, the sovereign has delighted in you, and all his servants have loved you. And now, be the sovereign’s son-in-law!’ ”

<sup>23</sup> And the servants of Sha’ul spoke those words in the hearing of Dawiḏ. And Dawiḏ said, “Does it seem to you a small matter to be a sovereign’s son-in-law, seeing I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?”

<sup>24</sup> And the servants of Sha’ul told him, saying, “Dawiḏ has spoken according to these words.”

<sup>25</sup> And Sha’ul said, “Say to Dawiḏ, ‘The sovereign has no delight in any payment for the bride but one hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to take vengeance on the sovereign’s enemies.’ ” But Sha’ul intended to have Dawiḏ fall by the hand of the Philistines.

<sup>26</sup> And his servants declared these words to Dawiḏ, and it pleased Dawiḏ well to become the sovereign’s son-in-law. And the days had not expired,

<sup>27</sup> and Dawiḏ arose and went, he and his men, and smote two hundred men of the Philistines. And Dawiḏ brought their foreskins, and they set them before the sovereign, to become the sovereign’s son-in-law. And Sha’ul gave him Miḵal his daughter as a wife.

<sup>28</sup> And Sha’ul saw and knew that יהוה was with Dawiḏ, and Miḵal daughter of Sha’ul did love him.

<sup>29</sup> So then Sha’ul was still more afraid of Dawiḏ. And Sha’ul came to be an enemy of Dawiḏ all the days.

<sup>30</sup> And the princes of the Philistines went out to fight. And it came to be, whenever they went out, that Dawiḏ acted more wisely than all the servants of Sha’ul, so that his name came to be very precious.

<sup>1</sup> And it came to be, when he had ended speaking to Sha’ul, that the being of Yehonathan was knit to the being of Dawiḏ, and Yehonathan loved him as his own being.

<sup>2</sup> And Sha’ul took him that day, and would not let him return to his father’s house any more.

<sup>3</sup> And Yehonathan and Dawiḏ made a covenant, because he loved him as his own being.

<sup>4</sup> And Yehonathan took off the robe that was on him and gave it to Dawiḏ, and his garments, even to his sword and his bow and his girdle.

<sup>5</sup> And Dawiḏ went out wherever Sha’ul sent him. He acted wisely, and Sha’ul set him over the men of battle, and it was right in the eyes of all the people and also in the eyes of Sha’ul’s servants.

<sup>16</sup> But all Yisra’ĕl and Yehuḏah loved Dawiḏ, as he went out and came in before them.

<sup>17</sup> And Sha’ul said to Dawiḏ, “See my older daughter Mĕraḇ! I give her to you as a wife. Only be brave for me, and fight the battles of יהוה.” For Sha’ul thought, “Let not my hand be against him, but let the hand of the Philistines be against him.”
