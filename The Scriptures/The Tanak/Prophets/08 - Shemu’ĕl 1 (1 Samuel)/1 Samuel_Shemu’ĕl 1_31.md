<sup>1</sup> And the Philistines were fighting against Yisra’ĕl, and the men of Yisra’ĕl fled from before the Philistines, and fell slain on Mount Gilboa.

<sup>2</sup> And the Philistines followed hard after Sha’ul and his sons. And the Philistines smote Yehonathan, and Aḇinaḏaḇ, and Malkishua, sons of Sha’ul.

<sup>3</sup> And the battle went hard against Sha’ul, and the archers hit him, so that he was severely wounded by the archers.

<sup>4</sup> And Sha’ul said to his armour-bearer, “Draw your sword, and thrust me through with it, lest these uncircumcised men come and thrust me through and roll themselves on me.” But his armour-bearer would not, for he was greatly afraid. So Sha’ul took the sword and fell on it.

<sup>5</sup> And when his armour-bearer saw that Sha’ul was dead, he also fell on his sword, and died with him.

<sup>6</sup> Thus Sha’ul died, and three of his sons, and his armour-bearer, also all his men, together on that day.

<sup>7</sup> And they saw – the men of Yisra’ĕl who were beyond the valley, and those who were beyond the Yardĕn – that the men of Yisra’ĕl had fled and that Sha’ul and his sons were dead. So they forsook the cities and fled, and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.

<sup>8</sup> And the next day it came to be, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Sha’ul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.

<sup>9</sup> And they cut off his head and stripped off his armour, and sent word throughout the land of the Philistines, to announce it in the house of their idols and to the people.

<sup>10</sup> And they placed his armour in the house of the Ashtaroth, and they fastened his body to the wall of Bĕyth Shan.

<sup>11</sup> And the inhabitants of Yaḇĕsh Gil‛aḏ heard what the Philistines had done to Sha’ul,

<sup>12</sup> and all the brave men arose and went all night, and took the body of Sha’ul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Bĕyth Shan. And they came to Yaḇĕsh and burned them there.

<sup>13</sup> And they took their bones and buried them under the tamarisk tree at Yaḇĕsh, and fasted for seven days.
