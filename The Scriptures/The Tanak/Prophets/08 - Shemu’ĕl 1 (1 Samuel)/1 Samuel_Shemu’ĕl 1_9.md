<sup>1</sup> And there was a man of Binyamin whose name was Qish, son of Aḇi’ĕl, son of Tseror, son of Beḵorath, son of Aphiyaḥ, a Binyamite, a mighty man of power.

<sup>2</sup> And he had a son whose name was Sha’ul, young and handsome. And there was not a more handsome man than he among the children of Yisra’ĕl, taller than any of the people by the shoulders and upwards.

<sup>3</sup> And the donkeys of Qish, father of Sha’ul, were lost. And Qish said to his son Sha’ul, “Please take one of the servants with you, and arise, go seek the donkeys.”

<sup>4</sup> And he passed through the mountains of Ephrayim and through the land of Shalishah, but they did not find them. Then they passed through the land of Sha‛alim, but they were not. Then he passed through the land of the Binyamites, but they did not find them.

<sup>5</sup> They came to the land of Tsuph, and Sha’ul said to his servant who was with him, “Come, let us turn back, lest my father stops thinking about the donkeys and become worried about us.”

<sup>6</sup> And he said to him, “See, there is in this city a man of Elohim, and the man is esteemed. All that he says comes true, without fail. Now, let us go there. It could be that he shows us the way to go.”

<sup>7</sup> And Sha’ul said to his servant, “But look, if we go, what do we bring the man? For the bread in our bags is all gone, and there is no present to bring to the man of Elohim. What do we have?”

<sup>8</sup> And the servant answered Sha’ul again and said, “Look, I have here at hand one fourth of a sheqel of silver. And I shall give that to the man of Elohim, and he shall make known to us our way.”

<sup>9</sup> Formerly, in Yisra’ĕl, when a man went to inquire of Elohim, he spoke thus, “Come, let us go to the seer,” for the prophet of today was formerly called a seer.

<sup>10</sup> And Sha’ul said to his servant, “Your word is good. Come, let us go.” And they went to the city where the man of Elohim was.

<sup>11</sup> As they went up the hill to the city, they met some young women going out to draw water, and said to them, “Is the seer here?”

<sup>12</sup> And they answered them and said, “He is. Look, ahead of you. Hurry now, for he came to this city today, for the people have an offering on the high place today.

<sup>13</sup> “As you come into the city, you are going to find him before he goes up to the high place to eat. For the people do not eat until he comes, for he blesses the slaughtering, afterward they who are invited eat. And now, go up, for you should find him about this time.”

<sup>14</sup> And they went up to the city. They were coming into the midst of the city, and saw Shemu’ĕl coming out toward them to go up to the high place.

<sup>15</sup> And יהוה had revealed to Shemu’ĕl in his ear the day before Sha’ul came, saying,

<sup>16</sup> “At this time tomorrow I shall send you a man from the land of Binyamin, and you shall anoint him leader over My people Yisra’ĕl, and he shall save My people from the hand of the Philistines. For I have seen My people, because their cry has come to me.”

<sup>17</sup> And when Shemu’ĕl saw Sha’ul, יהוה said to him, “See, the man of whom I spoke to you. Let this one govern My people.”

<sup>18</sup> And Sha’ul drew near to Shemu’ĕl in the gate, and said, “Please inform me, where is the house of the seer?”

<sup>19</sup> And Shemu’ĕl answered Sha’ul and said, “I am the seer. Go up before me to the high place, for you shall eat with me today. And tomorrow I shall let you go and make known to you all that is in your heart.

<sup>20</sup> “As for your donkeys that were lost three days ago, do not set your heart on them, for they have been found. And on whom is all the desire of Yisra’ĕl? Is it not on you and on all your father’s house?”

<sup>21</sup> And Sha’ul answered and said, “Am I not a Binyamite – of the smallest of the tribes of Yisra’ĕl, and my clan the least of all the clans of the tribe of Binyamin? Why then do you speak like this to me?”

<sup>22</sup> And Shemu’ĕl took Sha’ul and his servant and brought them into the hall, and gave to them a place at the head of those who were invited, and there were about thirty men.

<sup>23</sup> And Shemu’ĕl said to the cook, “Bring the portion which I gave you, of which I told you to set it aside.”

<sup>24</sup> And the cook brought out the thigh with its upper part and set it before Sha’ul. And Shemu’ĕl said, “See what was kept back. It was set aside for you. Eat, for it has been kept for you for this appointed time, saying, I have invited the people.” And Sha’ul ate with Shemu’ĕl on that day.

<sup>25</sup> And they came down from the high place into the city, and Shemu’ĕl spoke with Sha’ul on the roof.

<sup>26</sup> And they rose early. And it came to be about the dawning of the day that Shemu’ĕl called to Sha’ul on the roof, saying, “Rise, so that I send you on your way.” And Sha’ul rose, and both of them went outside, he and Shemu’ĕl.

<sup>27</sup> As they were walking toward the edge of the city, Shemu’ĕl said to Sha’ul, “Say to the servant to go on ahead of us.” And he went on. “But you stand here a moment, so that I let you hear the word of Elohim.”
