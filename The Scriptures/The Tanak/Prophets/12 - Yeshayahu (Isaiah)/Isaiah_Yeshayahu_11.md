<sup>1</sup> And a Rod shall come forth from the stump of Yishai, and a Sprout from his roots shall bear fruit.

<sup>2</sup> The Spirit of יהוה shall rest upon Him – the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, the Spirit of counsel and might, the Spirit of knowledge and of the fear of יהוה,

<sup>3</sup> and shall make Him breathe in the fear of יהוה. And He shall not judge by the sight of His eyes, nor decide by the hearing of His ears.

<sup>4</sup> But with righteousness He shall judge the poor, and shall decide with straightness for the meek ones of the earth, and shall smite the earth with the rod of His mouth, and slay the wrong with the breath of His lips.

<sup>5</sup> And righteousness shall be the girdle of His loins, and trustworthiness the girdle of His waist.

<sup>6</sup> And a wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and a leopard lie down with the young goat, and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together, and a little child leads them.

<sup>7</sup> And cow and bear shall feed, their young ones lie down together, and a lion eat straw like an ox.

<sup>8</sup> And the nursing child shall play by the cobra’s hole, and the weaned child shall put his hand in the adder’s den.

<sup>9</sup> They do no evil nor destroy in all My set-apart mountain, for the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of יהוה as the waters cover the sea.

<sup>10</sup> And in that day there shall be a Root of Yishai, standing as a banner to the people. Unto Him the gentiles shall seek, and His rest shall be esteem.

<sup>11</sup> And it shall be in that day that יהוה sets His hand again a second time to recover the remnant of His people who are left, from Ashshur and from Mitsrayim, from Pathros and from Kush, from Ĕylam and from Shin‛ar, from Ḥamath and from the islands of the sea.

<sup>12</sup> And He shall raise a banner for the nations, and gather the outcasts of Yisra’ĕl, and assemble the dispersed of Yehuḏah from the four corners of the earth.

<sup>13</sup> And the envy of Ephrayim shall turn aside, and the adversaries of Yehuḏah be cut off. Ephrayim shall not envy Yehuḏah, and Yehuḏah not trouble Ephrayim.

<sup>14</sup> But they shall fly down upon the shoulder of the Philistines toward the west; together they plunder the people of the east, their hand stretching forth on Eḏom and Mo’aḇ, and the children of Ammon shall be subject to them.

<sup>15</sup> And יהוה shall put under the ban the tongue of the Sea of Mitsrayim, and He shall wave His hand over the River with the might of His Spirit, and shall smite it in the seven streams, and shall cause men to tread it in sandals.

<sup>16</sup> And there shall be a highway for the remnant of His people, those left from Ashshur, as it was for Yisra’ĕl in the day when he came up from the land of Mitsrayim.

<sup>1</sup> And a Rod shall come forth from the stump of Yishai, and a Sprout from his roots shall bear fruit.
