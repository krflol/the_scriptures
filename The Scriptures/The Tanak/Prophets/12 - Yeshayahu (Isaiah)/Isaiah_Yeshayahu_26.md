<sup>1</sup> In that day this song is sung in the land of Yehuḏah, “We have a strong city – He sets up deliverance, walls and ramparts.

<sup>2</sup> “Open the gates, let the righteous nation which guards the truth enter in.

<sup>3</sup> “The one steadfast of mind You guard in perfect peace, for he trusts in You.

<sup>4</sup> “Trust in יהוה forever, for in Yah, יהוה, is a rock of ages.

<sup>5</sup> “For He shall bring down those who dwell on high. He lays the exalted city low, He lays it low to the earth, He brings it down to the dust.

<sup>6</sup> “A foot tramples it down – feet of the poor, footsteps of the needy.”

<sup>7</sup> The path of the righteous is uprightness; O upright One, You weigh the course of the righteous.

<sup>8</sup> Also, in the path of Your right-rulings, O יהוה, we have waited for You; the longing of our being is for Your Name and for the remembrance of You.

<sup>9</sup> My being longs for You in the night, also, my spirit within me seeks You earnestly. For when Your right-rulings are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world shall learn righteousness.

<sup>10</sup> The wrong finds favour, yet he shall not learn righteousness; in the land of straightforwardness he acts perversely, and does not see the excellency of יהוה.

<sup>11</sup> O יהוה, Your hand is high, they do not see. They see the ardour of the people and are ashamed; also, let the fire for Your adversaries consume them.

<sup>12</sup> O יהוה, You establish peace for us, for You have also done all our works in us.

<sup>13</sup> O יהוה our Elohim, other masters besides You have had rule over us; only in You do we make mention of Your Name.

<sup>14</sup> The dead do not live; the departed spirits do not rise. Therefore You have visited and destroyed them, and made all their remembrance to perish.

<sup>15</sup> You shall increase the nation, O יהוה, You shall increase the nation; You are esteemed; You shall expand all the borders of the land.

<sup>16</sup> O יהוה, in distress they shall visit You, they shall pour out a prayer when Your disciplining is upon them.

<sup>17</sup> As a woman with child and about to give birth writhes and cries out in her pain, so shall we be before Your face, O יהוה.

<sup>18</sup> We have conceived, we writhed in pain; we have given birth to wind. We have not accomplished deliverance in the earth, nor have the inhabitants of the world fallen.

<sup>19</sup> Let Your dead live, together with my dead body, let them arise. Awake and sing, you who dwell in dust; for Your dew is a dew of light, and let the earth give birth to the departed spirits.

<sup>20</sup> Go, my people, enter your rooms, and shut your doors behind you; hide yourself, as it were, for a little while, until the displeasure is past.

<sup>21</sup> For look, יהוה is coming out of His place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their crookedness. And the earth shall disclose her blood, and no longer cover her slain.
