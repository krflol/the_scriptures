<sup>1</sup> See, a sovereign shall reign in righteousness, and rulers rule in right-ruling.

<sup>2</sup> And each one shall be as a hiding place from the wind, and a shelter from the downpour, as rivers of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.

<sup>3</sup> And the eyes of those who see are not dim, and the ears of those who hear listen.

<sup>4</sup> And the heart of the rash understand knowledge, and the tongue of the stammerers hurries to speak plainly.

<sup>5</sup> A fool is no longer called noble, nor the scoundrel said to be respectable;

<sup>6</sup> for a fool speaks folly, and his heart works wickedness: to practise filthiness, and to speak against יהוה that which misleads, to starve the being of the hungry, and to withhold the drink from the thirsty.

<sup>7</sup> And the methods of the scoundrel are evil – he has devised wicked plans to destroy the poor with words of falsehood, even when the needy pleads for right-ruling.

<sup>8</sup> But the generous one devises what is generous, and by generous deeds he rises up.

<sup>9</sup> Rise up, you women who are at ease, hear my voice; rise up you complacent daughters, listen to my speech.

<sup>10</sup> In little more than a year you shall be troubled, you complacent women; for the grape harvest shall fail, the ingathering shall not come.

<sup>11</sup> Tremble, you women who are at ease; be troubled, you complacent ones; strip yourselves, make yourselves bare, and gird sackcloth on your waists.

<sup>12</sup> Lament upon the breasts for the pleasant fields, for the fruit-bearing vine.

<sup>13</sup> Weeds and thornbushes come up over the ground of My people, indeed, over all the houses of joy, the city of revelry;

<sup>14</sup> for the palace is abandoned, the crowded city deserted. Hill and watchtower serve as caves forever, a joy of wild donkeys, a pasture of flocks;

<sup>15</sup> until the Spirit is poured upon us from on high, and the wilderness shall become garden-land, and the garden-land be reckoned as a forest.

<sup>16</sup> Then right-ruling shall dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness remain in the garden-land.

<sup>17</sup> The work of righteousness shall be peace, and the service of righteousness be rest and safety forever.

<sup>18</sup> And My people shall dwell in a home of peace, and in safe dwellings, and in undisturbed resting places,

<sup>19</sup> even when hail shall fall, felling the forest, and the city be brought low in humiliation.

<sup>20</sup> Blessed are you who sow beside all waters, who send out the foot of the ox and the donkey.
