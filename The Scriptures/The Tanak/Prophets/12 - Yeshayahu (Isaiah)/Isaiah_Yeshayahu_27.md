<sup>1</sup> In that day יהוה with His severe sword, great and strong, punishes Liwiathan the fleeing serpent, Liwiathan that twisted serpent. And He shall slay the monster that is in the sea.

<sup>2</sup> In that day sing to her, “A vineyard of red wine!

<sup>3</sup> “I, יהוה, do guard it, I water it every moment; lest any hurt it, I guard it night and day.

<sup>4</sup> “Wrath is not in Me. Who would set thornbushes and weeds against Me in battle? I would go through them, I would burn them together.

<sup>5</sup> “Or let him take hold of My strength and make peace with Me. Let him make peace with Me!”

<sup>6</sup> Those who come He causes to take root in Ya‛aqoḇ, Yisra’ĕl shall blossom and bud. And they shall fill the face of the world with fruit.

<sup>7</sup> Has He smitten him as He smote those who were smiting him? Or were they slain as those they had slaughtered?

<sup>8</sup> In measure, by sending her away, You contended with her. He shall take away by His rough wind in the day of the east wind.

<sup>9</sup> Therefore by this the crookedness of Ya‛aqoḇ is covered. And this is all the fruit of taking away his sin: when he makes all the stones of the altar like chalkstones that are beaten to dust – Ashĕrim and sun-pillars rise no more.

<sup>10</sup> For the city of defence is lonely, a home forsaken and left like a wilderness – there the calf feeds, and there it lies down, and shall consume its branches.

<sup>11</sup> When its twigs are dry, they are broken off, women come and set them on fire. For it is a people of no understanding, therefore He who made them has no compassion on them, and He who formed them shows them no favour.

<sup>12</sup> And in that day it shall be that יהוה threshes, from the channel of the River to the wadi of Mitsrayim. And you shall be gathered one by one, O children of Yisra’ĕl.

<sup>13</sup> And in that day it shall be that a great horn is blown, and those who were perishing in the land of Ashshur and the outcasts in the land of Mitsrayim shall come, and shall worship יהוה on the set-apart mountain, in Yerushalayim.
