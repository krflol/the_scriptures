<sup>1</sup> Thus said יהוה, “Guard right-ruling, and do righteousness, for near is My deliverance to come, and My righteousness to be revealed.

<sup>2</sup> “Blessed is the man who does this, and the son of man who lays hold on it, guarding the Sabbath lest he profane it, and guarding his hand from doing any evil.

<sup>3</sup> “And let not the son of the foreigner who has joined himself to יהוה speak, saying, ‘ יהוה has certainly separated me from His people,’ nor let the eunuch say, ‘Look I am a dry tree.’ ”

<sup>4</sup> For thus said יהוה, “To the eunuchs who guard My Sabbaths, and have chosen what pleases Me, and hold fast to My covenant:

<sup>5</sup> to them I shall give in My house and within My walls a place and a name better than that of sons and daughters – I give them an everlasting name that is not cut off.

<sup>6</sup> “Also the sons of the foreigner who join themselves to יהוה, to serve Him, and to love the Name of יהוה, to be His servants, all who guard the Sabbath, and not profane it, and hold fast to My covenant –

<sup>7</sup> them I shall bring to My set-apart mountain, and let them rejoice in My house of prayer. Their burnt offerings and their slaughterings are accepted on My altar, for My house is called a house of prayer for all the peoples.”

<sup>8</sup> The Master יהוה, who gathers the outcasts of Yisra’ĕl, declares, “I gather still others to him besides those who are gathered to him.”

<sup>9</sup> All you beasts of the field, come to devour, all you beasts in the forest.

<sup>10</sup> His watchmen are blind, all of them, they have not known. All of them are dumb dogs, unable to bark, dreaming, lying down, loving to slumber.

<sup>11</sup> And the dogs have a strong appetite, they never have enough. And they are shepherds! They have not known understanding. All of them look to their own way, every one for his own gain, from his own end, saying,

<sup>12</sup> “Come, let me bring wine and fill ourselves with strong drink. And tomorrow shall be as today, even much greater.”
