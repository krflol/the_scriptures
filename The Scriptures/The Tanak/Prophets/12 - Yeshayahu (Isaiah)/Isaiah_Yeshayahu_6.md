<sup>1</sup> In the year that Sovereign Uzziyahu died, I saw יהוה sitting on a throne, high and lifted up, and the train of His robe filled the Hĕḵal.

<sup>2</sup> Above it stood seraphim. Each one had six wings: with two he covered his face, with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew.

<sup>3</sup> And one cried to another and said, “Set-apart, set-apart, set-apart is יהוה of hosts; all the earth is filled with His esteem!”

<sup>4</sup> And the posts of the door were shaken by the voice of him who cried out, and the house was filled with smoke.

<sup>5</sup> And I said, “Woe to me, for I am undone! Because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips – for my eyes have seen the Sovereign, יהוה of hosts.”

<sup>6</sup> And one of the seraphim flew to me, having in his hand a live coal which he had taken with the tongs from the altar.

<sup>7</sup> And he touched my mouth with it, and said, “See, this has touched your lips; your crookedness is taken away, and your sin is covered.”

<sup>8</sup> And I heard the voice of יהוה, saying, “Whom do I send, and who would go for Us?” And I said, “Here am I! Send me.”

<sup>9</sup> And He said, “Go, and you shall say to this people, ‘Hearing, you hear, but do not understand; and seeing, you see, but do not know.’

<sup>10</sup> “Make the heart of this people fat, and their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and shall turn and be healed.”

<sup>11</sup> Then I said, “ יהוה, until when?” And He answered, “Until the cities are laid waste and without inhabitant, and the houses are without a man, and the land is laid waste, a ruin,

<sup>12</sup> and יהוה has removed men far away, and the forsaken places be many in the midst of the land.

<sup>13</sup> “But still, there is a tenth part in it, and it shall again be for a burning, like a terebinth tree and like an oak, whose stump remains when it is cut down. The set-apart seed is its stump!”
