<sup>1</sup> Woe to you ravager, while you have not been ravaged, and you treacherous, while they have not betrayed you! When you have ceased ravaging, you shall be ravaged. And when you stop betraying, they shall betray you.

<sup>2</sup> O יהוה, show us favour, for we have waited for You. Be their arm every morning, our deliverance also in time of distress.

<sup>3</sup> At the noise of the rumbling the people shall flee. When You lift Yourself up, the gentiles shall be scattered.

<sup>4</sup> And Your plunder shall be gathered like the gathering of the caterpillar; as locusts rush about, they rush upon them.

<sup>5</sup> יהוה is exalted, for He dwells on high; He has filled Tsiyon with right-ruling and righteousness.

<sup>6</sup> And He shall be the trustworthiness of your times, a wealth of deliverance, wisdom and knowledge. The fear of יהוה – that is His treasure.

<sup>7</sup> See, their brave ones shall cry outside, the messengers of peace weep bitterly.

<sup>8</sup> The highways shall be deserted, the wayfaring man shall have ceased. He has broken the covenant, he has despised the cities, he respected no man.

<sup>9</sup> The earth shall mourn and languish, Leḇanon shall be ashamed. Sharon shall be withered like a desert, and Bashan and Karmel be shaking.

<sup>10</sup> “Now I rise up,” declares יהוה. “Now I am exalted, now I am lifted up.

<sup>11</sup> “You conceive chaff, you bring forth stubble, your spirit devours you like fire.

<sup>12</sup> “And peoples shall be like the burnings of lime, like thorns cut up they are burned in the fire.

<sup>13</sup> “You who are afar off, hear what I shall do; and you who are near, know My might.”

<sup>14</sup> Sinners in Tsiyon shall be afraid; trembling shall grip the defiled ones, “Who of us shall dwell with the devouring fire? Who of us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?”

<sup>15</sup> He who walks righteously and speaks what is straight, he who rejects the gain of oppressions, who keeps his hands from accepting bribes, who stops his ears from hearing of bloodshed, and shuts his eyes from seeing evil –

<sup>16</sup> he shall inhabit the heights; strongholds of rocks be his refuge. His bread shall be given him, his water be steadfast.

<sup>17</sup> Your eyes shall see the Sovereign in His comeliness, see a land that is far off.

<sup>18</sup> Your heart ponders fear, “Where is the scribe? Where is he who weighs? Where is he who counts the towers?”

<sup>19</sup> No longer shall you see a fierce people, a people of too deep a lip to hear, of a jabbering tongue no one understands.

<sup>20</sup> See Tsiyon, the city of our appointed time; your eyes shall see Yerushalayim, an undisturbed home, a tent not taken down. Its stakes are never removed, nor any of its cords broken.

<sup>21</sup> But there, great is יהוה for us; a place of broad rivers, streams, in which no boat with oars sails, nor big ships pass by –

<sup>22</sup> for יהוה is our Judge, יהוה is our Lawgiver, יהוה is our Sovereign, He saves us –

<sup>23</sup> your ropes shall be slack, they do not strengthen their mast, they shall not spread the sail. Then the prey of great plunder shall be divided, the lame shall take the prey.

<sup>24</sup> Neither shall the inhabitant say, “I am sick.” The people who dwell in it is forgiven their crookedness!
