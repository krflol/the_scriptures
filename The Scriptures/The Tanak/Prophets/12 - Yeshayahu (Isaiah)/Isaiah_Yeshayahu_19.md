<sup>1</sup> The message concerning Mitsrayim. See, יהוה is riding on a swift cloud, and He shall come into Mitsrayim. And the idols of Mitsrayim shall tremble at His presence, and the heart of Mitsrayim melt in its midst.

<sup>2</sup> “And I shall stir up Mitsrites against Mitsrites, and they shall fight, each one against his brother, and each one against his neighbour, city against city, reign against reign.

<sup>3</sup> “And the spirit of Mitsrayim shall vanish within them, and I destroy their counsel. And they shall seek the idols and the mutterers, the mediums and the sorcerers.

<sup>4</sup> “And I shall deliver the Mitsrites into the hand of a cruel master, and a fierce sovereign to rule over them,” declares the Master, יהוה of hosts.

<sup>5</sup> And waters shall fail from the sea, and the river wasted and dried up.

<sup>6</sup> And the rivers shall stink, and the streams shall be weak and dried up. Reeds and rushes shall wither.

<sup>7</sup> Bare places by the River, by the mouth of the River, and every sown field by the River shall wither. It shall be driven away, and be no more.

<sup>8</sup> And the fishermen shall lament, and all those who cast hooks into the River shall mourn, and they who spread nets on the waters shall pine away.

<sup>9</sup> And those who work in fine flax, and those who weave fine fabric shall become ashamed.

<sup>10</sup> And its foundations shall be crushed, all the wage workers grieved in being.

<sup>11</sup> The princes of Tso‛an are only fools; the counsel of Pharaoh’s wise ones have become senseless. How do you say to Pharaoh, “I am the son of the wise, the son of ancient sovereigns?”

<sup>12</sup> Where are they? Where are your wise men? Let them show you, and let them know what יהוה of hosts has counselled against Mitsrayim.

<sup>13</sup> The princes of Tso‛an have become fools, the princes of Noph are deceived. They, the corner-stone of her tribes, have led Mitsrayim astray.

<sup>14</sup> יהוה has mixed a perverse spirit in her midst. And they have led Mitsrayim astray in all her work, as a drunkard strays in his vomit.

<sup>15</sup> And there is no work for Mitsrayim, by either head or tail, palm branch or bulrush.

<sup>16</sup> In that day Mitsrayim shall become like women, and tremble and fear because of the waving of the hand of יהוה of hosts, which He waves over it.

<sup>17</sup> And the land of Yehuḏah shall be a fear to Mitsrayim, everyone who mentions it fears for himself, because of the counsel of יהוה of hosts which He has counselled against it.

<sup>18</sup> In that day five cities in the land of Mitsrayim shall speak the language of Kena‛an and swear by יהוה of hosts, one is called the City of Destruction.

<sup>19</sup> In that day an altar to יהוה shall be in the midst of the land of Mitsrayim, and a standing column to יהוה at its border.

<sup>20</sup> And it shall be for a sign and for a witness to יהוה of hosts in the land of Mitsrayim. When they cry to יהוה because of the oppressors, He sends them a Saviour and an Elohim, and shall deliver them.

<sup>21</sup> And יהוה shall be known to Mitsrayim, and the Mitsrites shall know יהוה in that day, and make slaughtering and meal offering, and shall make a vow to יהוה and pay it.

<sup>22</sup> And יהוה shall smite Mitsrayim, smite it and heal it. And they shall turn to יהוה, and He shall hear them and heal them.

<sup>23</sup> In that day there shall be a highway from Mitsrayim to Ashshur, and Ashshur shall come into Mitsrayim and Mitsrayim into Ashshur, and Mitsrayim shall serve with Ashshur.

<sup>24</sup> In that day Yisra’ĕl shall be one of three with Mitsrayim and Ashshur, even a blessing in the midst of the earth,

<sup>25</sup> whom יהוה of hosts shall bless, saying, “Blessed is Mitsrayim My people, and Ashshur the work of My hands, and Yisra’ĕl My inheritance.”
