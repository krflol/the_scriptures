<sup>1</sup> “Oh everyone who thirsts, come to the waters. And you who have no silver, come, buy and eat. Come, buy wine and milk without silver and without price.

<sup>2</sup> “Why do you weigh out silver for what is not bread, and your labour for what does not satisfy? Listen, listen to Me, and eat what is good, and let your being delight itself in fatness.

<sup>3</sup> “Incline your ear, and come to Me. Hear, so that your being lives. And let Me make an everlasting covenant with you, the trustworthy kindnesses of Dawiḏ.

<sup>4</sup> “See, I have given Him as a witness to the people, a Leader and a Commander for the people.

<sup>5</sup> “See, a nation you do not know you shall call, and a nation who does not know you run to you, because of יהוה your Elohim, and the Set-apart One of Yisra’ĕl, for He has adorned you.”

<sup>6</sup> Seek יהוה while He is to be found, call on Him while He is near.

<sup>7</sup> Let the wrong forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts. Let him return to יהוה, who has compassion on him, and to our Elohim, for He pardons much.

<sup>8</sup> “For My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways My ways,” declares יהוה.

<sup>9</sup> “For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways, and My thoughts than your thoughts.

<sup>10</sup> “For as the rain comes down, and the snow from the heavens, and do not return there, but water the earth, and make it bring forth and bud, and give seed to the sower and bread to the eater,

<sup>11</sup> so is My Word that goes forth from My mouth – it does not return to Me empty, but shall do what I please, and shall certainly accomplish what I sent it for.

<sup>12</sup> “For with joy you go out, and with peace you are brought in – the mountains and the hills break forth into singing before you, and all the trees of the field clap the hands.

<sup>13</sup> “Instead of the thorn the cypress comes up, and instead of the nettle the myrtle comes up. And it shall be to יהוה for a name, for an everlasting sign which is not cut off.”
