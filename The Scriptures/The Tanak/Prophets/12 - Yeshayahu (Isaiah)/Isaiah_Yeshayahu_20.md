<sup>2</sup> at that same time יהוה spoke by means of Yeshayahu son of Amots, saying, “Go, and remove the sackcloth from your body, and take your sandals off your feet.” And he did so, walking naked and barefoot.

<sup>3</sup> And יהוה said, “As My servant Yeshayahu has walked naked and barefoot three years for a sign and a wonder against Mitsrayim and Kush,

<sup>4</sup> so does the sovereign of Ashshur lead away the captives of Mitsrayim and the exiles of Kush, young and old, naked and barefoot, with their buttocks uncovered – the shame of Mitsrayim.

<sup>5</sup> “And they shall be afraid and ashamed of Kush, their expectation, and of Mitsrayim, their boast.

<sup>6</sup> “And the inhabitant of this coastland shall say in that day, ‘See, such is our expectation, wherever we flee for help to be delivered from the sovereign of Ashshur. And how do we escape?’ ”
