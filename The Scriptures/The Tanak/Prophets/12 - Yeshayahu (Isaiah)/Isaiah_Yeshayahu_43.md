<sup>1</sup> But now, thus said יהוה, your Creator, O Ya‛aqoḇ, and He who formed you, O Yisra’ĕl, “Do not fear, for I have redeemed you. I have called you by your name, you are Mine.

<sup>2</sup> “When you pass through the waters, I am with you; and through rivers, they do not overflow you. When you walk through fire, you are not scorched, and a flame does not burn you.

<sup>3</sup> “For I am יהוה your Elohim, the Set-apart One of Yisra’ĕl, your Saviour; I gave Mitsrayim for your ransom, Kush and Seḇa in your place.

<sup>4</sup> “Since you were precious in My eyes, you have been esteemed, and I have loved you. And I give men in your place, and peoples for your life.

<sup>5</sup> “Do not fear, for I am with you. I shall bring your seed from the east, and gather you from the west.

<sup>6</sup> “I shall say to the north, ‘Give them up!’ And to the south, ‘Do not keep them back!’ Bring My sons from afar, and My daughters from the ends of the earth –

<sup>7</sup> all those who are called by My Name, whom I have created, formed, even made for My esteem.”

<sup>8</sup> He shall bring out a blind people who have eyes, and deaf ones who have ears.

<sup>9</sup> All the nations shall be assembled, and the peoples be gathered. Who among them declares this, and show us former events? Let them give their witnesses, to be declared right; or let them hear and say, “It is truth.”

<sup>10</sup> “You are My witnesses,” declares יהוה, “And My servant whom I have chosen, so that you know and believe Me, and understand that I am He. Before Me there was no Ĕl formed, nor after Me there is none.

<sup>11</sup> “I, I am יהוה, and besides Me there is no saviour.

<sup>12</sup> “I, I have declared and saved, and made known, and there was no foreign mighty one among you. And you are My witnesses,” declares יהוה, “that I am Ĕl.

<sup>13</sup> “Even from the day I am He, and no one delivers out of My hand. I work, and who turns it back?”

<sup>14</sup> Thus said יהוה, your Redeemer, the Set-apart One of Yisra’ĕl, “For your sake I shall send to Baḇel, and bring them all down as fugitives, even the Chaldeans, who rejoice in their ships.

<sup>15</sup> “I am יהוה, your Set-apart One, Creator of Yisra’ĕl, your Sovereign.”

<sup>16</sup> Thus said יהוה, who makes a way in the sea and a path through the mighty waters,

<sup>17</sup> who brings forth the chariot and horse, the army and the power (they lie down together, they do not rise, they have been extinguished, they have been quenched like a wick):

<sup>18</sup> “Do not remember the former events, nor consider the events of old.

<sup>19</sup> “See, I am doing what is new, let it now spring forth. Do you not know it? I am even making a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert.

<sup>20</sup> “The beast of the field esteems Me, the jackals and the ostriches, because I have given waters in the wilderness and rivers in the desert, to give drink to My people, My chosen,

<sup>21</sup> this people I have formed for Myself, let them relate My praise.

<sup>22</sup> “But you have not called on Me, O Ya‛aqoḇ, for you have been weary of Me, O Yisra’ĕl.

<sup>23</sup> “You have not brought Me the sheep for your burnt offerings, nor have you esteemed Me with your slaughterings. I have not caused you to serve with grain offerings, nor wearied you with incense.

<sup>24</sup> “You have not bought Me sweet cane with silver, nor have you satisfied Me with the fat of your slaughterings. You have only burdened Me with your sins, you have wearied Me with your crookednesses.

<sup>25</sup> “I, I am He who blots out your transgressions for My own sake, and remember your sins no more.

<sup>26</sup> “Remind Me, let us enter into judgment, together; relate, that you might be declared right.

<sup>27</sup> “Your first father sinned, and your interpreters have transgressed against Me.

<sup>28</sup> “So I have profaned the chief ones of the set-apart place, and I have delivered up Ya‛aqoḇ to the curse, and Yisra’ĕl to scorn.

<sup>1</sup> But now, thus said יהוה, your Creator, O Ya‛aqoḇ, and He who formed you, O Yisra’ĕl, “Do not fear, for I have redeemed you. I have called you by your name, you are Mine.
