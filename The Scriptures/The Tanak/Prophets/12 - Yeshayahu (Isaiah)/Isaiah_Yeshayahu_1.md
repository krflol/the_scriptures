<sup>1</sup> The vision of Yeshayahu son of Amots, which he saw concerning Yehuḏah and Yerushalayim in the days of Uzziyahu, Yotham, Aḥaz, Ḥizqiyahu – sovereigns of Yehuḏah.

<sup>2</sup> Hear, O heavens, and listen, O earth! For יהוה has spoken, “I have reared and brought up children, but they have transgressed against Me.

<sup>3</sup> An ox knows its owner and a donkey its master’s crib – Yisra’ĕl does not know, My people have not understood.”

<sup>4</sup> Alas, sinning nation, a people loaded with crookedness, a seed of evil-doers, sons acting corruptly! They have forsaken יהוה, they have provoked the Set-apart One of Yisra’ĕl, they went backward.

<sup>5</sup> Why should you be beaten any more? You continue in apostasy! All the head is sick, and all the heart faints.

<sup>6</sup> From the sole of the foot, to the head, there is no soundness in it – wounds and bruises and open sores; they have not been closed or bound up, or soothed with ointment.

<sup>7</sup> Your land is laid waste, your cities are burned with fire, strangers devour your land in your presence. And it is laid waste, as overthrown by strangers.

<sup>8</sup> And the daughter of Tsiyon is left as a booth in a vineyard, as a hut in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.

<sup>9</sup> Unless יהוה of hosts had left to us a small remnant, we would have become like Seḏom, we would have been made like Amorah.

<sup>10</sup> Hear the word of יהוה, you rulers of Seḏom; give ear to the Torah of our Elohim, you people of Amorah!

<sup>11</sup> “Of what use to Me are your many slaughterings?” declares יהוה. “I have had enough of burnt offerings of rams and the fat of fed beasts. I do not delight in the blood of bulls, or of lambs or goats.

<sup>12</sup> “When you come to appear before Me, who has required this from your hand, to trample My courtyards?

<sup>13</sup> “Stop bringing futile offerings, incense, it is an abomination to Me. New Moons, Sabbaths, the calling of meetings – I am unable to bear unrighteousness and assembly.

<sup>14</sup> “My being hates your New Moons and your appointed times, they are a trouble to Me, I am weary of bearing them.

<sup>15</sup> “And when you spread out your hands, I hide My eyes from you; even though you make many prayers, I do not hear. Your hands have become filled with blood.

<sup>16</sup> “Wash yourselves, make yourselves clean; put away the evil of your doings from before My eyes. Stop doing evil!

<sup>17</sup> “Learn to do good! Seek right-ruling, reprove the oppressor, defend the fatherless, plead for the widow.

<sup>18</sup> “Come now, and let us reason together,” says יהוה. “Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall be as wool.

<sup>19</sup> “If you submit and obey, you shall eat the good of the land;

<sup>20</sup> but if you refuse and rebel, you shall be devoured by the sword,” for the mouth of יהוה has spoken.

<sup>21</sup> How the steadfast city has become a whore! I have filled it with right-ruling; righteousness lodged in it, but now murderers.

<sup>22</sup> Your silver has become dross, your wine is mixed with water.

<sup>23</sup> Your rulers are stubborn, and companions of thieves. Everyone loves bribes, and runs after rewards. They do not defend the fatherless, nor does the cause of the widow reach them.

<sup>24</sup> Therefore the Master declares, יהוה of hosts, the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, “Ah, I shall be eased of My adversaries, and I shall be avenged of My enemies.

<sup>25</sup> “And I shall turn My hand against you, and shall refine your dross as with lye, and shall remove all your alloy.

<sup>26</sup> “And I shall give back your judges as at the first, and your counsellors as at the beginning. After this you shall be called the city of righteousness, a steadfast city.”

<sup>27</sup> Tsiyon shall be redeemed with right-ruling, and her returning ones with righteousness.

<sup>28</sup> And the destruction of transgressors and of sinners is together, and those who forsake יהוה shall be consumed.

<sup>29</sup> For they shall be ashamed of the terebinth trees which you have desired. And you shall be embarrassed because of the gardens which you have chosen.

<sup>30</sup> For you shall be as a terebinth whose leaf fades, and as a garden that has no water.

<sup>31</sup> The strong shall be for tow, and his work for a spark. And both shall burn together, with no one to extinguish.
