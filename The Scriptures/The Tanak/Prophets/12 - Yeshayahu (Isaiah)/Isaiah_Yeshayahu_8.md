<sup>1</sup> And יהוה said to me, “Take a large tablet, and write on it with a man’s pen concerning Mahĕr-Shalal-Ḥash-Baz.

<sup>2</sup> “And let Me take reliable witnesses to record, Uriyah the priest and Zeḵaryahu son of Yeḇereḵyahu.”

<sup>3</sup> And I went to the prophetess, and she conceived and bore a son. And יהוה said to me, “Call his name Mahĕr-Shalal-Ḥash-Baz;

<sup>4</sup> for before the child knows to cry ‘My father’ and ‘My mother,’ the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Shomeron is taken away before the sovereign of Ashshur.”

<sup>5</sup> And יהוה spoke to me again, saying,

<sup>6</sup> “Inasmuch as these people refused the waters of Shiloaḥ that flow softly, and rejoice in Retsin and in Remalyahu’s son;

<sup>7</sup> now therefore, see, יהוה brings up over them the waters of the River, strong and mighty – the sovereign of Ashshur and all his esteem. And he shall come up over all his channels and go over all his banks.

<sup>8</sup> “And he shall pass through Yehuḏah, he shall overflow and pass over, reaching up to the neck. And the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of Your land, O Immanu’ĕl.

<sup>9</sup> “Be shattered, O you peoples, and be broken in pieces! Give ear, all you from the far places of the earth. Gird yourselves, but be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, but be broken in pieces.

<sup>10</sup> “Take counsel, and it comes to naught; speak a word, and it does not stand, for Ĕl is with us.”

<sup>11</sup> For יהוה spoke thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying,

<sup>12</sup> “Do not say, ‘A conspiracy,’ concerning all that this people call a conspiracy, nor be afraid of their threats, nor be troubled.

<sup>13</sup> “ יהוה of hosts, Him you shall set apart. Let Him be your fear, and let Him be your dread.

<sup>14</sup> “And He shall be for a set-apart place, but a stone of stumbling and a rock that makes for falling to both the houses of Yisra’ĕl, as a trap and a snare to the inhabitants of Yerushalayim.

<sup>15</sup> “And many among them shall stumble and fall, and be broken and snared and taken.”

<sup>16</sup> Bind up the witness, seal the Torah among my taught ones.

<sup>17</sup> And I shall wait on יהוה, who hides His face from the house of Ya‛aqoḇ. And I shall look for Him.

<sup>18</sup> Look, I and the children whom יהוה has given me – for signs and wonders in Yisra’ĕl from יהוה of hosts, who dwells in Mount Tsiyon.

<sup>19</sup> And when they say to you, “Seek those who are mediums and wizards, who whisper and mutter,” should not a people seek their Elohim? Should they seek the dead on behalf of the living?

<sup>20</sup> To the Torah and to the witness! If they do not speak according to this Word, it is because they have no daybreak.

<sup>21</sup> And they shall pass through it hard pressed and hungry. And it shall be, when they are hungry, that they shall be wroth and curse their sovereign and their Elohim, looking upward.

<sup>22</sup> And they shall look to the earth and see distress and darkness, gloom of hard times, and be driven into thick darkness.
