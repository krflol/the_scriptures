<sup>1</sup> Send a lamb to the ruler of the land, from Sela to the wilderness, to the mountain of the daughter of Tsiyon.

<sup>2</sup> And it shall be, like a wandering bird, a nest thrown out, so are the daughters of Mo’aḇ at the fords of Arnon.

<sup>3</sup> “Bring counsel, execute judgment; make your shadow like the night in the middle of the day; hide the outcasts, do not betray him who escapes.

<sup>4</sup> “Let My outcasts dwell with you, O Mo’aḇ; be a shelter to them from the face of the ravager. For the oppressor has met his end, destruction has ceased, those trampling down have perished from the land.

<sup>5</sup> “And in kindness the throne shall be established. And One shall sit on it in truth, in the Tent of Dawiḏ, judging and seeking right-ruling, and speeding righteousness.”

<sup>6</sup> We have heard of the pride of Mo’aḇ – very proud – of his pride, his arrogance and his rage. His boastings are not true.

<sup>7</sup> So Mo’aḇ wails for Mo’aḇ, everyone wails. For the raisin-cakes of Qir Ḥareseth they moan. They are utterly smitten.

<sup>8</sup> For the fields of Ḥeshbon languish – the vine of Siḇmah. The masters of the gentiles have broken down its choice plants, which have reached to Ya‛zĕr and wandered through the wilderness. Her branches are stretched out, they are gone over the sea.

<sup>9</sup> Therefore I bewail the vine of Siḇmah, with the weeping of Ya‛zĕr. I water you with my tears, O Ḥeshbon and El‛alĕh, for acclamation have fallen over your summer fruit and your harvest.

<sup>10</sup> Gladness is taken away, and joy from the orchard; in the vineyards there is no singing, nor shouting; No treaders tread out wine in their presses; I have made their acclamation cease.

<sup>11</sup> Therefore my inward parts sound like a lyre for Mo’aḇ, and my inner being for Qir Ḥeres.

<sup>12</sup> And it shall be, when it is seen that Mo’aḇ has wearied herself on the high place, that she shall come to her set-apart place to pray, but not be able.

<sup>13</sup> This is the word which יהוה has spoken concerning Mo’aḇ since that time.

<sup>14</sup> But now יהוה has spoken, saying, “Within three years, as the years of a hired man, the esteem of Mo’aḇ is to be despised with all its great throng, and the remnant be few, small and weak.”
