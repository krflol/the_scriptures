<sup>1</sup> “Sing, O barren one, you who did not bear! Break forth into singing, and cry aloud, you who have not been in labour! For the children of the deserted one are more than the children of the married woman,” said יהוה.

<sup>2</sup> “Enlarge the place of your tent, and let them stretch out the curtains of your dwellings, spare not. Lengthen your cords, and strengthen your stakes.

<sup>3</sup> “For you shall break forth to the right and to the left, and your seed inherit the nations, and make the deserted cities inhabited.

<sup>4</sup> “Do not fear, for you shall not be put to shame, nor hurt, you shall not be humiliated. For the shame of your youth you shall forget, and not remember the reproach of your widowhood any more.

<sup>5</sup> “For your Maker is your husband, יהוה of hosts is His Name, and the Set-apart One of Yisra’ĕl is your Redeemer. He is called the Elohim of all the earth.

<sup>6</sup> “For יהוה has called you like a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit, like a wife of youth when you were refused,” declares your Elohim.

<sup>7</sup> “For a little while I have forsaken you, but with great compassion I shall gather you.

<sup>8</sup> “In an overflow of wrath I hid My face from you for a moment, but with everlasting kindness I shall have compassion on you,” said יהוה, your Redeemer.

<sup>9</sup> “For this is the waters of Noaḥ to Me, in that I have sworn that the waters of Noaḥ would never again cover the earth, so have I sworn not to be wroth with you, nor to rebuke you.

<sup>10</sup> “For though the mountains be removed and the hills be shaken, My kindness is not removed from you, nor is My covenant of peace shaken,” said יהוה, who has compassion on you.

<sup>11</sup> “O you afflicted one, tossed with storm, and not comforted, see, I am setting your stones in antimony, and shall lay your foundations with sapphires,

<sup>12</sup> and shall make your battlements of rubies, your gates of crystal, and all your walls of precious stones,

<sup>13</sup> and all your children taught by יהוה, and the peace of your children great.

<sup>14</sup> “In righteousness you shall be established – far from oppression, for you shall not fear, and far from ruin, for it does not come near you.

<sup>15</sup> “See, they shall indeed assemble, but not because of Me. Whoever shall assemble against you falls for your sake!

<sup>16</sup> “See, I Myself have created the blacksmith who blows the coals in the fire, who brings forth an instrument for his work. And I have created the waster to destroy.

<sup>17</sup> “No weapon formed against you shall prosper, and every tongue which rises against you in judgment you shall prove wrong. This is the inheritance of the servants of יהוה, and their righteousness from Me,” declares יהוה.
