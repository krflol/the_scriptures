<sup>1</sup> For Tsiyon’s sake I am not silent, and for Yerushalayim’s sake I do not rest, until her righteousness goes forth as brightness, and her deliverance as a lamp that burns.

<sup>2</sup> And the nations shall see your righteousness, and all sovereigns your esteem. And you shall be called by a new name, which the mouth of יהוה designates.

<sup>3</sup> And you shall be a crown of comeliness in the hand of יהוה, and a royal head-dress in the hand of your Elohim.

<sup>4</sup> No longer are you called “Forsaken,” and no longer is your land called “Deserted.” But you shall be called “Ḥephtsiḇah,” and your land “Married,” for יהוה shall delight in you, and your land be married.

<sup>5</sup> For as a young man marries a maiden, so shall your sons marry you. And as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so shall your Elohim rejoice over you.

<sup>6</sup> I have set watchmen on your walls, O Yerushalayim, all the day and all the night, continually, who are not silent. You who remember יהוה, give yourselves no rest,

<sup>7</sup> and give Him no rest till He establishes and till He makes Yerushalayim a praise in the earth.

<sup>8</sup> יהוה has sworn by His right hand and by the arm of His strength, “No more do I give your grain to be food for your enemies, nor do sons of the foreigner drink your new wine, for which you have laboured;

<sup>9</sup> but those gathering it shall eat it, and praise יהוה. And those collecting it shall drink it in My set-apart courts.”

<sup>10</sup> Pass through, pass through the gates! Prepare the way for the people. Build up, build up the highway! Remove the stones. Lift up a banner for the peoples!

<sup>11</sup> See, יהוה has proclaimed to the end of the earth: “Say to the daughter of Tsiyon, ‘See, your deliverance has come; see, His reward is with Him, and His work before Him.’ ”

<sup>12</sup> And they shall be called, “The Set-apart People, the Redeemed of יהוה.” And you shall be called, “Sought Out, a City Not Forsaken.”
