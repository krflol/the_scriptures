<sup>1</sup> The message concerning Mo’aḇ. Because in the night Ar of Mo’aḇ was laid waste, was silenced! Because in the night Qir of Mo’aḇ was laid waste, was silenced!

<sup>2</sup> He has gone up to the house and Diḇon, to the high places to weep. Mo’aḇ is wailing over Neḇo and over Mĕyḏeḇa; on all their heads is baldness, and every beard is cut off.

<sup>3</sup> In their streets they shall put on sackcloth; on the tops of their houses and in their streets everyone wails, weeping bitterly.

<sup>4</sup> And Ḥeshbon and El‛alĕh cry out, their voice shall be heard as far as Yahats. Therefore the armed ones of Mo’aḇ shout; his being shall tremble within him.

<sup>5</sup> My own heart is toward Mo’aḇ; her fugitives cry unto Tso‛ar, like a three-year-old heifer. For by the ascent of Luḥith they go up with weeping; for in the way of Ḥoronayim they raise a cry of destruction.

<sup>6</sup> For the waters of Nimrim are wastes, for the green grass has withered away; the grass fails, there is no greenness.

<sup>7</sup> Therefore the wealth, acquired and stored up, they take away to the wadi of the Willows.

<sup>8</sup> For the cry has gone all around the borders of Mo’aḇ, its wailing to Eḡlayim and its wailing to Be’ĕr Ĕlim.

<sup>9</sup> “For the waters of Dimon shall be filled with blood; for I shall bring more upon Dimon, lions upon him who escapes from Mo’aḇ, and on the remnant of the land.”
