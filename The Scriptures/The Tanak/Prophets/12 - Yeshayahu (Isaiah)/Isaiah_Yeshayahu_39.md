<sup>1</sup> At that time Meroḏaḵ-Balaḏan son of Balaḏan, sovereign of Baḇel, sent letters and a present to Ḥizqiyahu, for he heard that he had been sick and had recovered.

<sup>2</sup> And Ḥizqiyahu was pleased with them, and showed them the house of his treasures, the silver and gold, the spices and precious ointment, and all his armoury, and all that was found among his treasures. There was not an object in his house or in all his rule that Ḥizqiyahu did not show them.

<sup>3</sup> And Yeshayahu the prophet went to Sovereign Ḥizqiyahu, and said to him, “What did these men say, and from where did they come to you?” And Ḥizqiyahu said, “They came to me from a distant land, from Baḇel.”

<sup>4</sup> And he said, “What have they seen in your house?” And Ḥizqiyahu said, “They have seen all that is in my house; there is not an object among my treasures that I did not show them.”

<sup>5</sup> So Yeshayahu said to Ḥizqiyahu, “Hear the word of יהוה of hosts:

<sup>6</sup> ‘See, the days are coming when all that is in your house, and what your fathers have stored up until this day, shall be taken away to Baḇel; not a matter shall be left,’ declares יהוה.

<sup>7</sup> ‘And they shall take some of your sons who are born to you, whom you bring forth. And they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the sovereign of Baḇel.’ ”

<sup>8</sup> And Ḥizqiyahu said to Yeshayahu, “The word of יהוה which you have spoken is good!” And he said, “Because there is peace and truth in my days.”
