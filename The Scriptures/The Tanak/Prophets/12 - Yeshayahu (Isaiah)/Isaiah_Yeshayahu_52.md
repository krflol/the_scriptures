<sup>1</sup> Awake, awake! Put on your strength, O Tsiyon, put on your garments of splendour, O Yerushalayim, the set-apart city! For no more do the uncircumcised and the unclean come into you.

<sup>2</sup> Shake yourself from the dust, arise, and sit down, O Yerushalayim. Loose yourself from the bonds of your neck, O captive daughter of Tsiyon!

<sup>3</sup> For thus said יהוה, “You have been sold for naught, and you are redeemed not with silver.”

<sup>4</sup> For thus said the Master יהוה, “At first My people went down into Mitsrayim to sojourn there, and Ashshur oppressed them without cause.

<sup>5</sup> “And now, what have I here,” declares יהוה, “that My people are taken away for naught? Those who rule over them make them wail,” declares יהוה, “and My Name is despised all day continually.

<sup>6</sup> “Therefore My people shall know My Name, in that day, for I am the One who is speaking. See, it is I.”

<sup>7</sup> How pleasant upon the mountains are the feet of him who brings good news, who proclaims peace, who brings good news, who proclaims deliverance, who says to Tsiyon, “Your Elohim reigns!”

<sup>8</sup> The voice of your watchmen! They shall lift up their voices, together they shout for joy, because eye to eye they see the return of יהוה to Tsiyon.

<sup>9</sup> Break forth into joy, sing together, you waste places of Yerushalayim! For יהוה shall comfort His people, He shall redeem Yerushalayim.

<sup>10</sup> יהוה shall lay bare His set-apart arm in the eyes of all the nations. And all the ends of the earth shall see the deliverance of our Elohim.

<sup>11</sup> Turn aside! Turn aside! Come out from there, touch not the unclean. Come out of her midst, be clean, you who bear the vessels of יהוה.

<sup>12</sup> For you shall not come out in haste, nor go in flight. For יהוה is going before you, and the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl is your rear guard.

<sup>13</sup> See, My Servant shall work wisely, He shall be exalted and lifted up and very high.

<sup>14</sup> As many were astonished at You – so the disfigurement beyond any man’s and His form beyond the sons of men –

<sup>15</sup> He shall likewise startle many nations. Sovereigns shut their mouths at Him, for what had not been recounted to them they shall see, and what they had not heard they shall understand.
