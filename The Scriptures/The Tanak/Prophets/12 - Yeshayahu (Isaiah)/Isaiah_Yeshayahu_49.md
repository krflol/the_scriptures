<sup>1</sup> Listen to Me, O coastlands, and hear, you peoples from afar! יהוה has called Me from the womb, from My mother’s belly He has caused My Name to be remembered.

<sup>2</sup> And He made My mouth like a sharp sword, in the shadow of His hand He hid Me, and made Me a polished shaft. In His quiver He hid Me.”

<sup>3</sup> And He said to Me, ‘You are My servant, O Yisra’ĕl, in whom I am adorned.’

<sup>4</sup> And I said, ‘I have laboured in vain, I have spent my strength for emptiness, and in vain. But my right-ruling is with יהוה, and my work with my Elohim.’ ”

<sup>5</sup> And now said יהוה – who formed Me from the womb to be His Servant, to bring Ya‛aqoḇ back to Him, though Yisra’ĕl is not gathered to Him, yet I am esteemed in the eyes of יהוה, and My Elohim has been My strength –

<sup>6</sup> and He says, “Shall it be a small matter for You to be My Servant to raise up the tribes of Ya‛aqoḇ, and to bring back the preserved ones of Yisra’ĕl? And I shall give You as a light to the gentiles, to be My deliverance to the ends of the earth!”

<sup>7</sup> Thus said יהוה, the Redeemer of Yisra’ĕl, their Set-apart One, to the despised , to the loathed One of the nation, to the Servant of rulers, “Sovereigns shall see and arise, rulers also shall bow themselves, because of יהוה who is steadfast, the Set-apart One of Yisra’ĕl. And He has chosen You!”

<sup>8</sup> Thus said יהוה, “In a favourable time I shall answer You, and in the day of deliverance I shall help You – and I guard You and give You for a covenant of the people, to restore the earth, to cause them to inherit the ruined inheritances,

<sup>9</sup> to say to the prisoners, ‘Go out,’ to those who are in darkness, ‘Show yourselves.’ “Let them feed on the ways, and let their pasture be on all bare hills.

<sup>10</sup> “They shall not hunger nor thirst, neither heat or sun strike them, for He who has compassion on them shall lead them, even by fountains of water guide them.

<sup>11</sup> “And I shall make all My mountains a way, and My highways raised up.

<sup>12</sup> “See, these come from far away, and see, those from the north and the west, and these from the land of Sinim.”

<sup>13</sup> Sing, O heavens, rejoice, O earth! And break out in singing, O mountains! For יהוה shall comfort His people and have compassion on His afflicted ones.

<sup>14</sup> But Tsiyon says, “ יהוה has forsaken me, and יהוה has forgotten me.”

<sup>15</sup> “Would a woman forget her nursing child, and not have compassion on the son of her womb? Though they forget, I never forget you.

<sup>16</sup> “See, I have inscribed you on the palms of My hands; your walls are always before Me.

<sup>17</sup> “Your sons shall hurry, your destroyers and those who laid you waste depart from you.

<sup>18</sup> “Lift up your eyes round about and see, all of them gather together and come to you. As I live,” declares יהוה, “you shall put on all of them as an ornament, and bind them on you as a bride does.

<sup>19</sup> “For your wastes, and your deserted places, and the land of your destruction, shall soon be too narrow for the inhabitants, while those who swallowed you up are far away.

<sup>20</sup> “The sons of your bereavement shall yet say in your ears, ‘The place is too narrow for me, make room for me to live.’

<sup>21</sup> “And you shall say in your heart, ‘Who has brought forth these for me, since I am bereaved and barren, an exile, and wandering to and fro? And who reared them? See, I was left alone – from where did these come?’ ”

<sup>22</sup> Thus said the Master יהוה, “See, I lift My hand up to the gentiles, and set up My banner for the peoples; and they shall bring your sons in their arms, and your daughters carried on their shoulders;

<sup>23</sup> “And sovereigns shall be your foster fathers, and their sovereignesses your nursing mothers. They bow down to you with their faces to the earth, and lick up the dust of your feet. And you shall know that I am יהוה – those who wait for Me shall not be ashamed.”

<sup>24</sup> Is prey taken from the mighty, and the captives of the righteous delivered?

<sup>25</sup> Yet thus said יהוה, “Even the captives of the mighty is taken away, and the prey of the ruthless is delivered; and I strive with him who strives with you, and I save your children.

<sup>26</sup> “And I shall feed those who oppress you with their own flesh, and let them drink their own blood as sweet wine. All flesh shall know that I, יהוה, am your Saviour, and your Redeemer, the Elohim of Ya‛aqoḇ.”
