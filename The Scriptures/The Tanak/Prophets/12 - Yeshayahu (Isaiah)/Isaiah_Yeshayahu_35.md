<sup>1</sup> Let the wilderness and the dry place be glad for them, and let the desert rejoice, and blossom as the rose.

<sup>2</sup> It blossoms much and rejoices, even with joy and singing. The esteem of Leḇanon shall be given to it, the excellence of Karmel and Sharon. They shall see the esteem of יהוה, the excellency of our Elohim.

<sup>3</sup> Strengthen the weak hands, and make firm the weak knees.

<sup>4</sup> Say to those with anxious heart, “Be strong, do not fear! See, your Elohim comes with vengeance, with the recompense of Elohim. He is coming to save you.”

<sup>5</sup> Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf be opened.

<sup>6</sup> Then the lame shall leap like a deer, and the tongue of the dumb sing, because waters shall burst forth in the wilderness, and streams in the desert.

<sup>7</sup> And the parched ground shall become a pool, and the thirsty land springs of water – in the home for jackals, where each lay, grass with reeds and rushes.

<sup>8</sup> And there shall be a highway, and a way, and it shall be called “The Way of Set-apartness.” The unclean does not pass over it, but it is for those who walk the way, and no fools wander on it.

<sup>9</sup> No lion is there, nor any ravenous beast go up on it, it is not found there. But the redeemed shall walk there.

<sup>10</sup> And the ransomed of יהוה shall return and enter Tsiyon with singing, with everlasting joy on their heads. They shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.
