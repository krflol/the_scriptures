<sup>1</sup> The message concerning the Wilderness of the Sea. As whirlwinds in the South sweep on, so it comes from the wilderness, from an awesome land.

<sup>2</sup> A distressing vision is revealed to me: the treacherous betrays, and the ravager ravages. Go up, O Ĕylam! Besiege, O Media! All the groaning I bring to an end.

<sup>3</sup> Therefore my loins are filled with anguish; pangs have seized me, like the pangs of a woman in labour. I was distressed when I heard it; I was troubled when I saw it.

<sup>4</sup> My heart reeled, horror overwhelmed me; the night for which I longed He turned into fear for me.

<sup>5</sup> Prepare the table, spread the mat, eat and drink. Arise, you princes, anoint the shield!

<sup>6</sup> For יהוה has said this to me, “Go, set a watchman, let him declare what he sees.”

<sup>7</sup> And he saw a chariot with a pair of horsemen, a chariot of donkeys, and a chariot of camels, and he listened attentively, very attentively.

<sup>8</sup> Then he cried, “A lion, O יהוה ! I stand continually on the watchtower in the daytime, and I have sat at my post every night.

<sup>9</sup> “And see this, a chariot of men coming with a pair of horsemen!” And he spoke up and said, “Baḇel is fallen, is fallen! And all the carved images of her mighty ones He has broken to the ground.”

<sup>10</sup> Oh, my threshing and the grain of my floor! That which I have heard from יהוה of hosts, the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, I have declared to you.

<sup>11</sup> The message concerning Dumah. He calls to me out of Sĕ‛ir, “Watchman, how much of the night is passed? Watchman, how much of the night has passed?”

<sup>12</sup> The watchman said, “Morning came, and also the night. If you inquire, inquire. Come again!”

<sup>13</sup> The message concerning Araḇia. In the forest in Araḇia you stay, O you travelling companies of Deḏanites.

<sup>14</sup> You who dwell in the land of Tĕma, bring water to him who is thirsty, meet the fugitive with bread.

<sup>15</sup> For they fled from the swords, from the drawn sword, from the bent bow, and from the stress of battle.

<sup>16</sup> For thus יהוה has said to me, “Within a year, according to the year of a hired man, all the esteem of Qĕḏar shall come to an end,

<sup>17</sup> and the rest of the number of archers, the mighty men of the people of Qĕḏar, shall be few. For יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl has spoken.”
