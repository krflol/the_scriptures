<sup>1</sup> See, יהוה is making the earth empty and making it waste, and shall overturn its surface, and shall scatter abroad its inhabitants.

<sup>2</sup> And it shall be – as with the people so with the priest, as with the servant so with his master, as with the female servant so with her mistress, as with the buyer so with the seller, as with the lender so with the borrower, as with the creditor so with the debtor;

<sup>3</sup> the earth is completely emptied and utterly plundered, for יהוה has spoken this word.

<sup>4</sup> The earth shall mourn and wither, the world shall languish and wither, the haughty people of the earth shall languish.

<sup>5</sup> For the earth has been defiled under its inhabitants, because they have transgressed the Torot, changed the law, broken the everlasting covenant.

<sup>6</sup> Therefore a curse shall consume the earth, and those who dwell in it be punished. Therefore the inhabitants of the earth shall be burned, and few men shall be left.

<sup>7</sup> The new wine shall fail, the vine shall languish, all those glad at heart shall sigh.

<sup>8</sup> The joy of the tambourine shall cease, the noise of those who rejoice shall end, the joy of the lyre shall cease.

<sup>9</sup> No more do they drink wine with a song, strong drink is bitter to those who drink it.

<sup>10</sup> The deserted city shall be broken down, every house shall be shut, no one enters.

<sup>11</sup> There is a crying for wine in the streets; all joy shall be darkened, the gladness of the earth shall be gone.

<sup>12</sup> The city is left in ruins, and the gate is stricken with destruction.

<sup>13</sup> For thus it is to be in the midst of the earth among the peoples, like the shaking of an olive tree, like the gleaning of grapes when the grape harvest is done.

<sup>14</sup> They lift up their voice, they sing of the excellency of יהוה, they shall cry aloud from the sea.

<sup>15</sup> Therefore praise יהוה in the east, the Name of יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl in the coastlands of the sea.

<sup>16</sup> From the ends of the earth we shall hear songs, “Splendour to the Righteous One!” But I say, “I waste away, I waste away! Woe to me! The treacherous betray, with treachery the treacherous betray.”

<sup>17</sup> Fear and the pit and the snare are upon you, O inhabitant of the earth.

<sup>18</sup> And it shall be that he who flees from the noise of the fear falls into the pit, and he who comes up from the midst of the pit is caught in the snare. For the windows from on high shall be opened, and the foundations of the earth be shaken.

<sup>19</sup> The earth shall be utterly broken, the earth shall be completely shattered, the earth shall be fiercely shaken.

<sup>20</sup> The earth shall stagger like a drunkard. And it shall totter like a hut, and its transgression shall be heavy upon it, and it shall fall, and not rise again.

<sup>21</sup> And in that day it shall be that יהוה punishes on high the host of exalted ones, and on the earth the sovereigns of the earth.

<sup>22</sup> And they shall be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison, and be punished after many days.

<sup>23</sup> And the moon shall blush, and the sun shall be ashamed, for יהוה of hosts shall reign on Mount Tsiyon, and in Yerushalayim, and before His elders, in esteem!
