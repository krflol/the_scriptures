<sup>1</sup> Woe to those who go down to Mitsrayim for help, and rely on horses, who trust in chariots because they are many, and in horsemen because they are very strong, but who do not look to the Set-apart One of Yisra’ĕl, nor seek יהוה !

<sup>2</sup> And He also is wise, and has brought evil, and has not turned aside His words. And He shall rise up against the house of evil-doers, and against the help of workers of wickedness.

<sup>3</sup> And the Mitsrites are men, and not Ĕl. And their horses are flesh, and not spirit. And when יהוה stretches out His hand, both he who helps shall stumble, and he who is helped shall fall. And they shall all fall, together.

<sup>4</sup> For this is what יהוה has said to me, “As a lion roars, and a young lion over his prey, though a band of shepherds is called out against him, he is not afraid of their voice nor disturbed by their noise, so יהוה of hosts shall come down to fight upon Mount Tsiyon and upon its hill.

<sup>5</sup> “Like hovering birds, so does יהוה of hosts protect Yerushalayim – protecting and delivering, passing over and rescuing.”

<sup>6</sup> Turn back to Him from whom the children of Yisra’ĕl have deeply fallen away.

<sup>7</sup> For in that day, let each man reject his idols of silver and his idols of gold, which your own hands have made for yourselves, as a sin.

<sup>8</sup> “And Ashshur shall fall by a sword not of man, and a sword not of mankind shall devour him. But he shall flee from the sword, and his young men shall become slave labour,

<sup>9</sup> and his strength pass away because of fear, and his commanders shall be afraid of the banner,” declares יהוה, whose light is in Tsiyon and whose furnace is in Yerushalayim.
