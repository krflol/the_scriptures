<sup>1</sup> Bĕl has bowed down, Neḇo is stooping, their idols were on the beasts and on the cattle. That which is carried is burdensome, a burden to the weary.

<sup>2</sup> They have stooped, they have bowed down together, they were unable to deliver the burden, but they themselves went into captivity.

<sup>3</sup> “Listen to Me, O house of Ya‛aqoḇ, and all the remnant of the house of Yisra’ĕl, who are borne from the belly, who are carried from the womb:

<sup>4</sup> even to your old age, I am He, and even to grey hairs I carry! I have made and I bear, and I carry and rescue.

<sup>5</sup> “To whom do you liken Me, and compare Me and make Me similar, that we should be alike?

<sup>6</sup> “They pour gold out of the bag, and weigh silver on the scale. They hire a goldsmith, and he makes it a mighty one. They fall down, they also bow themselves.

<sup>7</sup> “They bear it on the shoulder, they carry it and set it in its place, and it stands – from its place it does not move. Though one cries out to it, it does not answer, nor save him from his distress.

<sup>8</sup> “Remember this, and show yourselves men; turn it back, you transgressors.

<sup>9</sup> “Remember the former events of old, for I am Ĕl, and there is no one else – Elohim, and there is no one like Me,

<sup>10</sup> declaring the end from the beginning, and from of old that which has not yet been done, saying, ‘My counsel does stand, and all My delight I do,’

<sup>11</sup> calling a bird of prey from the east, the man who executes My counsel, from a distant land. Indeed I have spoken it, I also bring it to pass. I have planned it, I also do it.

<sup>12</sup> “Listen to Me, you stubborn-hearted, who are far from righteousness:

<sup>13</sup> “I shall bring My righteousness near, it is not far off, and My deliverance, it is not delayed. And I shall give deliverance in Tsiyon, My esteem to Yisra’ĕl.
