<sup>1</sup> “Thus said יהוה to His anointed, to Koresh, whose right hand I have grasped, to subdue nations before him and ungird the loins of sovereigns, to open before him the double doors, so that gates are not shut:

<sup>2</sup> ‘I go before you and make the crooked places straight; I shatter the gates of bronze and cut down the bars of iron.

<sup>3</sup> ‘And I shall give you the treasures of darkness and hoarded wealth of secret places, so that you know that I, יהוה, who are calling you by your name, am the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl.

<sup>4</sup> ‘For the sake of Ya‛aqoḇ My servant, and of Yisra’ĕl My chosen, I also call you by your name, I give you a title, though you have not known Me.

<sup>5</sup> ‘I am יהוה, and there is none else – there is no Elohim besides Me. I gird you, though you have not known Me,

<sup>6</sup> so that they know from the rising of the sun to its setting that there is none but Me. I am יהוה, and there is none else,

<sup>7</sup> forming light and creating darkness, making peace and creating evil. I, יהוה, do all these.’

<sup>8</sup> “Rain down, O heavens, from above, and let clouds pour down righteousness. Let the earth open, let them bring forth deliverance, and let righteousness spring up together. I, יהוה, have created it.

<sup>9</sup> “Woe to him who strives with his Maker! (a potsherd with the potsherds of the earth). Does clay say to him who forms it, ‘What are you making?’ Or your handiwork say, ‘He has no hands’?

<sup>10</sup> “Woe to him who says to his father, ‘What are you bringing forth?’ Or to the woman, ‘What are you labouring over?’ ”

<sup>11</sup> Thus said יהוה, the Set-apart One of Yisra’ĕl, and his Maker, “Do you ask Me about My sons what is to come? And about the work of My hands do you command Me?

<sup>12</sup> “I have made the earth, and created man on it. I, My hands have stretched out the heavens, and all their host I have commanded.

<sup>13</sup> “I have stirred him up in righteousness, and all his ways I make straight. He builds My city and lets My exiles go, not for price nor reward,” declares יהוה of hosts.

<sup>14</sup> Thus said יהוה, “The labour of Mitsrayim and merchandise of Kush and of the Seḇaites, men of size, come over to you and they are yours. They walk behind you, they come over in chains, and they bow down to you. They make supplication to you, saying, ‘Indeed, Ĕl is in you, and there is none else, no mighty one.’ ”

<sup>15</sup> Truly You are Ĕl, who hide Yourself, O Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, Saviour!

<sup>16</sup> They shall be put to shame, and even be humiliated, all of them – the makers of idols shall go away together in humiliation.

<sup>17</sup> Yisra’ĕl shall be saved by יהוה with an everlasting deliverance. You are not to be ashamed nor hurt, forever and ever.

<sup>18</sup> For thus said יהוה, Creator of the heavens, He is Elohim, Former of earth and its Maker, He established it, He did not create it to be empty, He formed it to be inhabited: “I am יהוה, and there is none else.

<sup>19</sup> “I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth. I have not said to the seed of Ya‛aqoḇ, ‘Seek Me in vain.’ I am יהוה, speaking righteousness, declaring matters that are straight.

<sup>20</sup> “Gather yourselves and come; draw near together, you who have escaped from the gentiles. No knowledge have they who are lifting up the wood of their carved image, and pray to a mighty one that does not save.

<sup>21</sup> “Declare and bring near, let them even take counsel together. Who has announced this from of old? Who has declared it from that time? Is it not I, יהוה ? And there is no mighty one besides Me, a righteous Ĕl and a Saviour, there is none besides Me.

<sup>22</sup> “Turn to Me and be saved, all you ends of the earth! For I am Ĕl, and there is none else.

<sup>23</sup> “I have sworn by Myself, a word has gone out of My mouth in righteousness, and shall not return, so that to Me every knee shall bow, every tongue swear.

<sup>24</sup> “One shall say, ‘Only in יהוה do I have righteousness and strength’ – he comes to Him. And all those displeased with Him shall be put to shame.

<sup>25</sup> “In יהוה all the seed of Yisra’ĕl shall be declared right and boast. ”
