<sup>1</sup> O יהוה, You are my Elohim. I exalt You, I praise Your Name, for You shall do a wonder – counsels of long ago, trustworthiness, truth.

<sup>2</sup> For You shall make a city a heap, a walled city a ruin, a palace of foreigners to be a city no more – never to be rebuilt.

<sup>3</sup> Therefore a strong people praise You, the city of the ruthless nations fear You.

<sup>4</sup> For You shall be a refuge to the poor, a refuge to the needy in his distress, a shelter from the storm, a shade from the heat. For the spirit of the ruthless is like a storm against a wall.

<sup>5</sup> You subdue the noise of foreigners, as heat in a dry place; as heat in the shadow of a cloud, the singing of the ruthless is subdued.

<sup>6</sup> And in this mountain יהוה of hosts shall make for all people a feast of choice pieces, a feast of old wines, of choice pieces with marrow, of old wines, well-refined.

<sup>7</sup> And He shall swallow up on this mountain the surface of the covering which covers all people, and the veil which is spread over all nations.

<sup>8</sup> He shall swallow up death forever, and the Master יהוה shall wipe away tears from all faces, and take away the reproach of His people from all the earth. For יהוה has spoken.

<sup>9</sup> And it shall be said in that day, “See, this is our Elohim. We have waited for Him, and He saves us. This is יהוה, we have waited for Him, let us be glad and rejoice in His deliverance.”

<sup>10</sup> For the hand of יהוה rests on this mountain, and Mo’aḇ is trodden down under Him, as straw is trodden down in the water of a dunghill.

<sup>11</sup> And He shall spread out His hands in their midst as he who swims spreads out his hands to swim, and He shall bring down their pride together, with the skill of His hands.

<sup>12</sup> And the high stronghold of your walls He shall bring down, lay it low, levelled to the ground, down to the dust.
