<sup>1</sup> And the men of Ephrayim gathered together, and passed over toward Tsaphon, and said to Yiphtaḥ, “Why did you pass over to fight against the children of Ammon, and did not call us to go with you? We are going to burn your house over you with fire!”

<sup>2</sup> And Yiphtaḥ said to them, “My people and I were in a great struggle with the children of Ammon. And when I called you, you did not save me out of their hands.

<sup>3</sup> “And I saw that you would not save me, then I took my life in my hands and went over against the children of Ammon. And יהוה gave them into my hand. And why have you come up to me today to fight against me?”

<sup>4</sup> Yiphtaḥ then gathered together all the men of Gil‛aḏ and fought against Ephrayim. And the men of Gil‛aḏ smote Ephrayim, because they had said, “You Gil‛aḏites are fugitives of Ephrayim in the midst of Ephrayim, in the midst of Menashsheh.”

<sup>5</sup> And Gil‛aḏ captured the fords of the Yardĕn that faced Ephrayim. And it came to be, when the fugitives from Ephrayim said, “Let me pass over,” the men of Gil‛aḏ said to him, “You are an Ephrayimite!” If he said, “No,”

<sup>6</sup> then they would say to him, “Please say, ‘Shibboleth’!” And he would say, “Sibboleth,” for he was unable to pronounce it right. Then they seized him and slew him at the fords of the Yardĕn. And at that time there fell forty-two thousand Ephrayimites.

<sup>7</sup> And Yiphtaḥ ruled Yisra’ĕl six years. And Yiphtaḥ the Gil‛aḏite died and was buried in one of the cities of Gil‛aḏ.

<sup>8</sup> And after him, Iḇtsan of Bĕyth Leḥem ruled Yisra’ĕl.

<sup>9</sup> And he came to have thirty sons and thirty daughters – he sent abroad and brought in thirty daughters for his sons. And he ruled Yisra’ĕl seven years.

<sup>10</sup> And Iḇtsan died and was buried at Bĕyth Leḥem.

<sup>11</sup> And after him Ĕlon the Zeḇulunite ruled Yisra’ĕl. And he ruled Yisra’ĕl ten years.

<sup>12</sup> And Ĕlon the Zeḇulunite died and was buried at Ayalon in the land of Zeḇulun.

<sup>13</sup> And after him, Aḇdon son of Hillĕl the Pirathonite ruled Yisra’ĕl,

<sup>14</sup> and he had forty sons and thirty grandsons, who rode on seventy young donkeys. And he ruled Yisra’ĕl eight years.

<sup>15</sup> And Aḇdon son of Hillĕl the Pirathonite died and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephrayim, in the mountains of the Amalĕqites.
