<sup>1</sup> And after Aḇimeleḵ there arose Tola son of Pu’ah, son of Doḏo, a man of Yissasḵar, to save Yisra’ĕl. And he dwelt in Shamur in the mountains of Ephrayim.

<sup>2</sup> And he ruled Yisra’ĕl twenty-three years. Then he died and was buried in Shamur.

<sup>3</sup> And after him arose Ya’ir, a Gil‛aḏite, and he ruled Yisra’ĕl twenty-two years.

<sup>4</sup> And he had thirty sons who rode on thirty donkeys. And they had thirty towns, which are called Hawoth Yair to this day, which are in the land of Gil‛aḏ.

<sup>5</sup> And Ya’ir died, and was buried in Qamon.

<sup>6</sup> And the children of Yisra’ĕl again did evil in the eyes of יהוה, and served the Ba‛als and the Ashtoreths, and the mighty ones of Aram, and the mighty ones of Tsiḏon, and the mighty ones of Mo’aḇ, and the mighty ones of the children of Ammon, and the mighty ones of the Philistines – and forsook יהוה and did not serve Him.

<sup>7</sup> Therefore the displeasure of יהוה burned against Yisra’ĕl. And He sold them into the hands of the Philistines and into the hands of the children of Ammon.

<sup>8</sup> And they crushed and oppressed the children of Yisra’ĕl that year – for eighteen years – all the children of Yisra’ĕl who were beyond the Yardĕn in the land of the Amorites, in Gil‛aḏ.

<sup>9</sup> And the children of Ammon passed over the Yardĕn to fight against Yehuḏah, and against Binyamin, and against the house of Ephrayim, so that Yisra’ĕl had great distress.

<sup>10</sup> And the children of Yisra’ĕl cried out to יהוה, saying, “We have sinned against You, because we have both forsaken our Elohim and served the Ba‛als!”

<sup>11</sup> So יהוה said to the children of Yisra’ĕl, “Was it not from the Mitsrites and from the Amorites and from the children of Ammon and from the Philistines that I saved you?

<sup>12</sup> “And the Tsiḏonians and Amalĕq and Ma‛on oppressed you. And you cried out to Me, and I saved you from their hand.

<sup>13</sup> “But you, you have forsaken Me and served other mighty ones. Therefore I do not save you again.

<sup>14</sup> “Go and cry out to the mighty ones which you have chosen, let them save you in your time of distress.”

<sup>15</sup> And the children of Yisra’ĕl said to יהוה, “We have sinned! Do to us whatever is good in Your eyes, only deliver us today, please.”

<sup>16</sup> So they put away the foreign mighty ones from their midst and served יהוה. And His being was grieved with the trouble of Yisra’ĕl.

<sup>17</sup> Then the children of Ammon were called together and encamped in Gil‛aḏ. And the children of Yisra’ĕl gathered together and encamped in Mitspah.

<sup>18</sup> And the people, the heads of Gil‛aḏ, said to each other, “Let the man who is the first to fight against the children of Ammon be head over all the inhabitants of Gil‛aḏ.”

<sup>1</sup> And after Aḇimeleḵ there arose Tola son of Pu’ah, son of Doḏo, a man of Yissasḵar, to save Yisra’ĕl. And he dwelt in Shamur in the mountains of Ephrayim.

<sup>6</sup> And the children of Yisra’ĕl again did evil in the eyes of יהוה, and served the Ba‛als and the Ashtoreths, and the mighty ones of Aram, and the mighty ones of Tsiḏon, and the mighty ones of Mo’aḇ, and the mighty ones of the children of Ammon, and the mighty ones of the Philistines – and forsook יהוה and did not serve Him.
