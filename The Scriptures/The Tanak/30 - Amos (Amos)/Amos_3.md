<sup>1</sup> Hear this word that יהוה has spoken against you, O children of Yisra’ĕl, against the entire clan which I brought up from the land of Mitsrayim, saying,
<sup>2</sup> “You alone have I known of all the clans of the earth, therefore I punish you for all your crookednesses.”
<sup>3</sup> Would two walk together, without having met?
<sup>4</sup> Does a lion roar in the forest, when he has no prey? Does a young lion give forth his voice out of his den unless he has caught?
<sup>5</sup> Does a bird fall into a snare on the earth, where there is no trap for it? Does a snare spring up from the earth, if it has not captured prey?
<sup>6</sup> If a ram’s horn is blown in a city, do the people not tremble? If there is calamity in a city, shall not יהוה have done it?
<sup>7</sup> For the Master יהוה does no matter unless He reveals His secret to His servants the prophets.
<sup>8</sup> A lion has roared! Who is not afraid? The Master יהוה has spoken! Who would not prophesy?
<sup>9</sup> “Cry out at the palaces in Ashdoḏ, and at the palaces in the land of Mitsrayim, and say, ‘Gather on the mountains of Shomeron, and see the many unrests in her midst, and the oppressed ones within her.
<sup>10</sup> ‘But they do not know to do what is right,’ declares יהוה, ‘these who store up plunder and loot in their palaces.’ ”
<sup>11</sup> Therefore thus said the Master יהוה, “An enemy, even all around the land! And he shall bring down your strength from you, and your palaces shall be plundered.”
<sup>12</sup> Thus said יהוה, “As a shepherd rescues from the mouth of a lion two legs or a piece of an ear, so are the children of Yisra’ĕl who dwell in Shomeron to be rescued – in the corner of a bed and on the edge of a couch!
<sup>13</sup> “Hear and witness against the house of Ya‛aqoḇ,” declares the Master יהוה, the Elohim of hosts.
<sup>14</sup> “For in the day I visit Yisra’ĕl for their transgressions, I shall also punish concerning the altars of Bĕyth Ĕl. And the horns of the altar shall be broken, and they shall fall to the ground.
<sup>15</sup> “And I shall smite the winter house along with the summer house. And the houses of ivory shall perish, and the great houses shall be swept away,” declares יהוה.
