<sup>1</sup> And Eliphaz the Tĕmanite answered and said,
<sup>2</sup> “Would a wise man answer with vain knowledge, or fill his belly with the east wind?
<sup>3</sup> Would he reason with useless talk, or by speeches with which do not profit?
<sup>4</sup> Indeed, you do away with reverence, and withhold prayer before Ĕl.
<sup>5</sup> For your crookedness teaches your mouth what to say, and you choose the tongue of the crafty.
<sup>6</sup> Not I, but your own mouth condemns you. And your own lips witness against you.
<sup>7</sup> Were you the first one born? Or were you made before the hills?
<sup>8</sup> Have you heard the secret counsel of Eloah? And do you limit wisdom to yourself?
<sup>9</sup> What do you know that we do not know – understand, that is not within us?
<sup>10</sup> Both the grey-haired and the aged are among us, much older than your father.
<sup>11</sup> Are the comforts of Ĕl not enough for you – and a word that deals gently with you?
<sup>12</sup> What have you taken to heart? And why do your eyes flash?
<sup>13</sup> That you should turn your spirit against Ĕl, and let such words go out of your mouth?
<sup>14</sup> What is man, that he should be clean? And one born of a woman, that he should be righteous?
<sup>15</sup> Look, He puts no trust in His set-apart ones, and the heavens are not clean in His eyes,
<sup>16</sup> how much less one who is loathsome and corrupt, drinking unrighteousness like water!
<sup>17</sup> Let me show you – hear me – and this I have seen and declare,
<sup>18</sup> which the wise declare, and have not hidden from their fathers,
<sup>19</sup> to them alone the land was given, and no stranger passed over into their midst:
<sup>20</sup> All the days of the wrong one he is paining himself, and few years have been stored up for the ruthless.
<sup>21</sup> A frightening sound is in his ears; in peace a destroyer comes to him.
<sup>22</sup> He believes not to return from darkness, and he is reserved for the sword.
<sup>23</sup> He wanders about for food – where is it? He knows that a day of darkness is prepared for him.
<sup>24</sup> Distress and pain frighten him – they overwhelm him, like a sovereign ready for the attack.
<sup>25</sup> Because he has stretched out his hand against Ĕl, and acts mightily against the Almighty.
<sup>26</sup> He runs against Him defiantly, with thick-bossed shields.
<sup>27</sup> For he has covered his face with his fatness, and he has put layers of fat on his loins.
<sup>28</sup> But he dwells in ruined cities, in houses which no one lives in, which have been ready to become heaps.
<sup>29</sup> He shall not be rich, and his wealth shall not rise, and his possessions shall not overspread the earth.
<sup>30</sup> He does not turn away from darkness. The flame dries up his branches, and he turns aside by the breath of His mouth.
<sup>31</sup> Let him not trust in falsehood, deceiving himself, for falsehood is his reward.
<sup>32</sup> Before his day it is accomplished, and his branch shall not be green.
<sup>33</sup> He shakes off his unripe grape like a vine, and throws off his blossom like an olive tree.
<sup>34</sup> For the company of the defiled ones is barren, and fire consumes the tents of bribery.
<sup>35</sup> They conceive trouble and bring forth wickedness, even their womb prepares deception.”
