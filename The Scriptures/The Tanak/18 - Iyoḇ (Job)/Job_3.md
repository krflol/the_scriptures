<sup>1</sup> After this Iyoḇ opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth.
<sup>2</sup> And Iyoḇ spoke, and said,
<sup>3</sup> “Let the day perish on which I was born, and the night it was said, ‘A male child has been conceived.’
<sup>4</sup> Let that day be darkness. Let not Eloah from above seek for it, nor let light shine upon it.
<sup>5</sup> Let darkness and the shadow of death buy it back, let a cloud dwell on it, let all that blackens the day frighten it.
<sup>6</sup> That night – let darkness seize it. Let it not be included among the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months.
<sup>7</sup> Look, let that night be silent! Let no singing come into it!
<sup>8</sup> Let those curse it who curse the day, who are ready to stir up Liwiathan.
<sup>9</sup> Let the stars of its twilight be dark. Let it wait for light, but have none. And let it not see the eyelashes of the dawn.
<sup>10</sup> For it did not shut up the doors of my mother’s womb, nor hide trouble from my eyes.
<sup>11</sup> Why did I not die from the womb, come forth from the belly and expire?
<sup>12</sup> Why were there knees to receive me? Or breasts for me to suck?
<sup>13</sup> For now I would have been lying in peace. I would have slept – then I would have been at rest,
<sup>14</sup> with sovereigns and counsellors of the earth, who built ruins for themselves,
<sup>15</sup> or with rulers who had gold, who filled their houses with silver,
<sup>16</sup> or as a hidden untimely birth, as infants who never saw light?
<sup>17</sup> There the wrong cease raging, and there the weary are at rest,
<sup>18</sup> the prisoners rest together, they do not hear the voice of the oppressor.
<sup>19</sup> The small and great are there, and the servant is free from his master.
<sup>20</sup> Why does He give light to the sufferer, and life to the bitter of being,
<sup>21</sup> who are waiting for death, but it does not come, and search for it more than treasures;
<sup>22</sup> who rejoice exceedingly, they are glad when they find the grave?
<sup>23</sup> Why does He give light to a man whose way has been hidden, and whom Eloah has hedged in?
<sup>24</sup> For my sighing comes before I eat, and my groanings pour out like water.
<sup>25</sup> For that which I greatly feared has come upon me, and that which I dreaded has overtaken me.
<sup>26</sup> I have not been at ease, nor have I been undisturbed, nor been at rest, yet trouble comes!”
