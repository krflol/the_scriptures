<sup>1</sup> Then these three men ceased to answer Iyoḇ, because he was righteous in his own eyes.
<sup>2</sup> And the wrath of Elihu, son of Baraḵ’ĕl the Buzite, of the clan of Ram, burned against Iyoḇ. His wrath burned because he declared himself right rather than Elohim.
<sup>3</sup> And against his three friends his wrath burned, because they had found no answer, and pronounced Elohim wrong.
<sup>4</sup> And because they were years older than he, Elihu had waited to speak to Iyoḇ.
<sup>5</sup> And when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, his wrath burned.
<sup>6</sup> And Elihu, son of Baraḵ’ĕl the Buzite, responded and said, “I am young in years, and you are aged. Therefore I was afraid to let you know my opinion.
<sup>7</sup> I said, ‘Days should speak, and many years should teach wisdom.’
<sup>8</sup> But truly it is the spirit in man and the breath of the Almighty that gives him understanding.
<sup>9</sup> The multitude are not wise, nor do the aged understand right-ruling.
<sup>10</sup> Therefore I have said, ‘Listen to me, let me also make my opinion known to you.’
<sup>11</sup> Look, I waited for your words, I listened to your reasonings, while you searched out what to say.
<sup>12</sup> And I paid close attention to you. But look, not one of you proved Iyoḇ wrong, nor answered his words.
<sup>13</sup> Lest you say, ‘We have found wisdom’ – it is Ĕl that drives him away, not man.
<sup>14</sup> Now he has not ordered words against me, so I would not answer him with your words.
<sup>15</sup> They have broken down; they have not answered again; words have departed from them.
<sup>16</sup> And I have waited, but they do not speak, because they have stood still, they answered no more.
<sup>17</sup> Let me answer on my part, let me also make my opinion known.
<sup>18</sup> For I am filled with words; the spirit within me presses me.
<sup>19</sup> See, within me it is like wine not opened; it shall burst like new wineskins.
<sup>20</sup> Let me speak, so that I find relief; let me open my lips and answer.
<sup>21</sup> Please, let me not show partiality to anyone, nor let me flatter any man.
<sup>22</sup> For I do not know how to flatter, lest my Maker should soon take me away!
