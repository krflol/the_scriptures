<sup>1</sup> And Iyoḇ answered and said,
<sup>2</sup> “Truly I know it is so. But how is man right with Elohim?
<sup>3</sup> If one wished to dispute with Him, he would not answer Him one time out of a thousand.
<sup>4</sup> Wise in heart and mighty in strength – who has hardened himself against Him and is at peace?
<sup>5</sup> He who removes mountains, and they do not know it, when He overturns them in His displeasure;
<sup>6</sup> who shakes the earth out of its place, and its columns tremble;
<sup>7</sup> who commands the sun, and it does not rise; and He seals up the stars,
<sup>8</sup> stretching out the heavens by Himself, and treading upon the waves of the sea;
<sup>9</sup> who made Ash, Kesil, and Kimah, and the rooms of the south;
<sup>10</sup> who performs great and unsearchable deeds, and innumerable wonders.
<sup>11</sup> Look, He goes by me, and I do not see; and He moves past, but I do not discern Him.
<sup>12</sup> Look, He snatches away, who brings it back? Who says to Him, ‘What are You doing?’
<sup>13</sup> Eloah does not turn back His dis-pleasure, the helpers of pride stoop under Him.
<sup>14</sup> How much less would I answer Him, choose my words with Him?
<sup>15</sup> For though I were righteous, I would not answer Him. I pray to Him for my right-ruling.
<sup>16</sup> Though I had called and He answered me, I would not believe that He was listening to my voice.
<sup>17</sup> For He crushes me with a storm, and has multiplied my wounds for no cause.
<sup>18</sup> He does not allow me to recover my breath, but fills me with bitterness.
<sup>19</sup> If I speak of power? Look, He is mighty. And if of right-ruling? Who sets me a time?
<sup>20</sup> If I am righteous? My mouth would declare me wrong. Am I perfect? It would declare me perverse.
<sup>21</sup> Am I perfect? Do I not know my own being? I despise my life!
<sup>22</sup> It is all the same, therefore I say, ‘He destroys the perfect and the wrong.’
<sup>23</sup> If the scourge slays suddenly, He laughs at the trial of the innocent.
<sup>24</sup> Earth has been given into the hand of the wrong. He covers the faces of its judges. If it is not He, then who is it?
<sup>25</sup> My days have become swifter than a runner – they have fled, they have not seen good.
<sup>26</sup> They have passed by like swift ships, like an eagle swooping on its prey.
<sup>27</sup> If I say, ‘Let me forget my complaint, let me put off my sad face, and let me smile,’
<sup>28</sup> I shall be afraid of all my sufferings. I know that You do not hold me innocent.
<sup>29</sup> If I am wrong, why should I labour in vain?
<sup>30</sup> If I washed myself with snow water, and cleansed my hands with soap,
<sup>31</sup> then You would plunge me into a ditch, and my garments shall abhor me.
<sup>32</sup> For He is not a man as I am that I answer Him, and we come together into right-ruling.
<sup>33</sup> There is no mediator between us, to lay his hand upon us both.
<sup>34</sup> Let Him take His rod away from me, and let His dread frighten me.
<sup>35</sup> Then I would speak and not fear Him, for I am not so within myself.
