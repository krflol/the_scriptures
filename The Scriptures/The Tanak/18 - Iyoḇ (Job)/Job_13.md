<sup>1</sup> “Look, my eye has seen it all, my ear has heard and understood it.
<sup>2</sup> What you know, I know too; I am not less than you.
<sup>3</sup> But I would speak to the Almighty, and I delight to reason with Ĕl.
<sup>4</sup> But you smear with falsehood, worthless healers, all of you!
<sup>5</sup> If you would only be silent, then it would be your wisdom!
<sup>6</sup> Please hear my reasoning, and listen to the pleadings of my lips.
<sup>7</sup> Would you speak perversely for Ĕl, and speak deceit for Him?
<sup>8</sup> Would you be partial towards Him? Would you plead for Ĕl?
<sup>9</sup> Would it be well when He searches you out? Or could you deceive Him as one deceives a man?
<sup>10</sup> He would certainly reprove you if you secretly show partiality.
<sup>11</sup> Should not His excellence make you afraid, and the dread of Him fall upon you?
<sup>12</sup> Your weighty sayings are proverbs of ashes, your shields are shields of clay.
<sup>13</sup> Be silent before me, and let me speak, and let whatever come upon me!
<sup>14</sup> Why do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in my hands?
<sup>15</sup> Though, He does slay me – I wait! But I show my ways to be right before Him.
<sup>16</sup> He also is my deliverance, for a defiled one does not come before Him.
<sup>17</sup> Listen closely to my words, and with your ears to what I say.
<sup>18</sup> Look, please, I have prepared my case, I know that I am in the right.
<sup>19</sup> Who is he who would strive with me? For then I would keep silent and die.
<sup>20</sup> Only two matters do not do to me, then I am not hidden from Your face:
<sup>21</sup> Withdraw Your hand far from me, and let not dread of You make me afraid.
<sup>22</sup> Then call, and let me answer; or let me speak, and You reply to me.
<sup>23</sup> How many are my crookednesses and sins? Let me know my transgression and my sin.
<sup>24</sup> Why do You hide Your face, and reckon me as Your enemy?
<sup>25</sup> Would You frighten a leaf driven to and fro? And would You pursue dry stubble?
<sup>26</sup> For You write bitter charges against me, and make me inherit the crookednesses of my youth,
<sup>27</sup> and put my feet in the stocks, and look closely to all my paths. You set a limit for the soles of my feet.
<sup>28</sup> And he, like that which is rotten, wastes away, as a garment that is moth-eaten.
