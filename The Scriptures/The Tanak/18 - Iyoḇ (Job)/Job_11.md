<sup>1</sup> And Tsophar the Na‛amathite answered and said,
<sup>2</sup> “Should a multitude of words go un-answered? And should a man of lips be declared right?
<sup>3</sup> Should your babblings silence men? And should you mock, and no one make you ashamed?
<sup>4</sup> Since you have said, ‘My discourse is flawless, and I have been clean in Your eyes.’
<sup>5</sup> But if only Eloah would speak, and open His lips against you,
<sup>6</sup> and show you the secrets of wisdom, doubling your ability. Know then that Eloah forgets some of your crookedness for you.
<sup>7</sup> Would you find out Eloah by searching, or search out the end of the Almighty?
<sup>8</sup> It is higher than the heavens – what would you do? Deeper than the grave – what would you know?
<sup>9</sup> Their measure is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.
<sup>10</sup> If He passes through and shuts up, and gathers, then who does reverse it?
<sup>11</sup> For He knows false men. When He sees wickedness does He not consider it?
<sup>12</sup> But a senseless man takes heart when a wild donkey’s colt is born a man!
<sup>13</sup> If you would prepare your heart, and stretch out your hands toward Him;
<sup>14</sup> if wickedness were in your hand, put it far away and do not let perverseness dwell in your tents;
<sup>15</sup> then indeed you shall lift up your face without spot; and you shall stand firm, and not be afraid,
<sup>16</sup> because you would forget sorrow, and remember it as waters that have passed away,
<sup>17</sup> and your life would be brighter than noon. You would soar upward, you would be like the morning.
<sup>18</sup> And you shall trust, because there is expectancy. And when you have searched you shall lie down in safety.
<sup>19</sup> And you shall rest, and no one would make you afraid, and many shall seek your favour.
<sup>20</sup> But the eyes of the wrong are consumed, and they shall not escape, and their expectancy is the breathing out of life!”
