<sup>1</sup> “I have made a covenant with my eyes. How then could I gaze at a maiden?
<sup>2</sup> For what is the portion of Eloah from above, and the inheritance of the Almighty from on high?
<sup>3</sup> Is it not calamity to the perverse, and strangeness to the workers of wickedness?
<sup>4</sup> Does He not see my ways, and number all my steps?
<sup>5</sup> If I have walked with falsehood, or if my foot has hurried to deceit,
<sup>6</sup> let Him weigh me in a right scale, and let Eloah know my integrity.
<sup>7</sup> If my step does turn from the way, or my heart has gone after my eyes, or if any spot has clung to my hands,
<sup>8</sup> let me sow, and another eat; and let my harvest be rooted out.
<sup>9</sup> If my heart has been enticed by a woman, or if I have lurked at my neighbour’s door,
<sup>10</sup> let my wife grind for another, and let others bow down over her.
<sup>11</sup> For that would be a wicked scheme, and a punishable crookedness.
<sup>12</sup> For that would be a fire that burns to destruction, and take root among all my increase.
<sup>13</sup> If I have refused the plea of my male servant or my female servant when they complained against me,
<sup>14</sup> then what should I do when Ĕl rises up? And when He punishes, what should I answer Him?
<sup>15</sup> Did not He who made me in the womb make him? And did not One fashion us in the womb?
<sup>16</sup> If I have withheld the poor from pleasure, or caused the widow’s eyes to fail,
<sup>17</sup> or eaten my piece of bread by myself, and the fatherless did not eat of it –
<sup>18</sup> but from my youth he grew up with me as with a father, and from my mother’s womb I guided her –
<sup>19</sup> if I have seen anyone perish for lack of garments, or a poor one without covering;
<sup>20</sup> if his loins have not blessed me, and he warmed himself with the fleece of my sheep;
<sup>21</sup> if I have raised my hand against the fatherless, when I saw I had help in the gate;
<sup>22</sup> let my arm fall from my shoulder, and my arm be broken from the bone.
<sup>23</sup> For I am in dread of destruction from Ĕl, and from His excellence I could not escape.
<sup>24</sup> If I have put my trust in gold, or called fine gold my refuge;
<sup>25</sup> if I have rejoiced because my wealth was great, and because my hand had gained much;
<sup>26</sup> if I have looked at the sun when it shines, or the moon moving in brightness,
<sup>27</sup> so that my heart has been secretly enticed, and my mouth has kissed my hand –
<sup>28</sup> that too is a punishable crookedness, for I would have denied Ĕl above.
<sup>29</sup> If I have rejoiced when he who hated me was ruined, or lifted myself up when evil found him –
<sup>30</sup> also I have not allowed my mouth to sin by asking for a curse on his life –
<sup>31</sup> if the men of my tent did not say, ‘Who is there that has not been satisfied with his meat?’
<sup>32</sup> The stranger did not have to spend the night in the street, for I have opened my doors to the way.
<sup>33</sup> If I have covered my transgressions like Aḏam, by hiding my crookedness in my bosom,
<sup>34</sup> then let me fear the great crowd, and dread the scorn of clans, then I would be silent, and go out of the door!
<sup>35</sup> Who would give me a hearing? See, my signature, let the Almighty answer me, and let my accuser write a bill!
<sup>36</sup> Would I not take it up on my shoulder, bind it on me for a crown?
<sup>37</sup> I would declare to Him the number of my steps – I would approach Him like a prince.
<sup>38</sup> If my land cries out against me, or its furrows weep together;
<sup>39</sup> if I have eaten its fruit without payment, or caused its owners to die;
<sup>40</sup> let thistles grow instead of wheat, and useless weed instead of barley.” The words of Iyoḇ are ended.
