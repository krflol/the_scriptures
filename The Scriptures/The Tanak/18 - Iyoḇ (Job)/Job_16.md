<sup>1</sup> And Iyoḇ answered and said,
<sup>2</sup> “I have heard many matters like these; all of you are comforters of trouble!
<sup>3</sup> Is there an end to words of wind? Or what provokes you that you answer?
<sup>4</sup> I might also speak like you, if you were in my place. I might heap up words against you, and shake my head at you.
<sup>5</sup> I might strengthen you with my mouth, and my moving lips might bring relief.
<sup>6</sup> If I speak, my pain is not relieved; and if I refrain, does it leave me?
<sup>7</sup> But now He has wearied me. You have stunned all my company.
<sup>8</sup> And You have plucked me, and it is a witness. And my failure rises up against me, it bears witness to my face.
<sup>9</sup> He has torn in His wrath, and He hates me. He has gnashed at me with His teeth; my adversary sharpens His eyes upon me.
<sup>10</sup> They open wide their mouths at me, in scorn they have smitten my cheeks, they mass themselves together against me.
<sup>11</sup> Ĕl has handed me over to the perverse, and cast me into the hands of the wrong.
<sup>12</sup> I was at ease, but He broke me. And He took me by my neck and shattered me, and He has set me up for His target.
<sup>13</sup> His archers surround me, He splits my kidneys in two and does not spare, He pours out my bile on the ground.
<sup>14</sup> He made a breach in me, breach upon breach. He runs upon me like a mighty man.
<sup>15</sup> I sewed sackcloth over my skin, and laid my horn in the dust.
<sup>16</sup> My face is reddened from weeping, and on my eyelids is the shadow of death;
<sup>17</sup> though no violence was on my hand, and my prayer sincere.
<sup>18</sup> O earth, do not cover my blood, and let my cry have no resting place!
<sup>19</sup> See, even now my witness is in the heavens, and my defender is on high.
<sup>20</sup> My friends are they that scorn me; my eyes pour out tears to Eloah.
<sup>21</sup> O that one might plead for a man with Eloah, as a man with his neighbour!
<sup>22</sup> When a few years are past, then I shall go the way of no return.
