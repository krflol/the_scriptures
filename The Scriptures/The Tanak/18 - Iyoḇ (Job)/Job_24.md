<sup>1</sup> “Times are not hidden from the Almighty, and why have not those who know Him seen His days?
<sup>2</sup> They remove landmarks; they rob and feed on flocks;
<sup>3</sup> they drive away the donkey of the fatherless; they take the widow’s ox as a pledge;
<sup>4</sup> they turn the needy out of the way; the poor of the earth have hidden together.
<sup>5</sup> See, as wild donkeys in the wilderness they go about their tasks, eager seekers for prey; the desert gives his bread, for the children.
<sup>6</sup> They reap his fodder in a field and they glean the vineyard of the wrong.
<sup>7</sup> They spend the night naked, without a garment, and without covering in the cold.
<sup>8</sup> They are wet with the showers of the hills, and have embraced a rock for lack of shelter.
<sup>9</sup> They snatch away the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge from the poor;
<sup>10</sup> naked, they shall go about without a garment; and hungry, they shall take away sheaves.
<sup>11</sup> They press out oil within their walls; winepresses they shall tread, yet suffer thirst.
<sup>12</sup> Men groan in the city, and the beings of the wounded cry out, and Eloah does not regard it as foolish.
<sup>13</sup> They have become rebels against the light; they have not known His ways nor remained in His paths.
<sup>14</sup> The murderer rises at daylight, he slays the poor and needy, and in the night he is as a thief.
<sup>15</sup> And the eye of the adulterer watches for dusk, saying, ‘No eye sees me.’ And he puts a covering on the face.
<sup>16</sup> In the dark he has broken into houses; by day they shut themselves up; they have not known light.
<sup>17</sup> For all of them morning is the same as the shadow of death, when he discerns the extreme fears of the shadow of death.
<sup>18</sup> He is swift on the face of the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth; he does not turn into the way of vineyards.
<sup>19</sup> Drought and heat snatch away snow waters – the grave those who have sinned.
<sup>20</sup> The womb forgets him, the worm feeds sweetly on him; he is remembered no more, and wickedness is broken like a tree;
<sup>21</sup> treating evil the barren who does not bear, and does no good for the widow.
<sup>22</sup> But He draws the mighty away with His power – He rises up, and no one is certain of life.
<sup>23</sup> He gives him safety, and he leans on it; yet His eyes are on their ways.
<sup>24</sup> They are lifted up for a little while, then they are gone, then they shall be brought low. Like all else they are gathered up, and they are cut off like the heads of grain.
<sup>25</sup> And if it is not so, who does prove me a liar, and make my word worthless?”
