<sup>1</sup> “Call out, please, is there anyone to answer you? And to which of the set-apart ones would you turn?
<sup>2</sup> For wrath kills the fool, and envy slays the simple.
<sup>3</sup> I myself have seen the fool taking root, but suddenly his home was cursed.
<sup>4</sup> His sons are far from safety, they are crushed in the gate, with no one to deliver.
<sup>5</sup> The hungry eat up his harvest, taking it even from the thorns, and the snare snaps up their wealth.
<sup>6</sup> For evil does not come from the dust, nor does trouble spring from the ground;
<sup>7</sup> for man is born for trouble, and the sparks fly upward.
<sup>8</sup> But as for me, I would seek Ĕl, and I would submit my case to Elohim,
<sup>9</sup> who is doing great and unsearchable deeds, innumerable wonders,
<sup>10</sup> who is giving rain on the earth’s face, and is sending waters on the field’s face;
<sup>11</sup> to set the lowly on high, and those who mourn shall be lifted to safety,
<sup>12</sup> thwarting the schemes of the crafty, so that their hands do not work effectively;
<sup>13</sup> catching the wise in their own craftiness, and the counsel of schemers are swept away.
<sup>14</sup> By day they encounter darkness, and at noon they grope as in the night.
<sup>15</sup> But He saves the needy from the sword of their mouth, from the clutches of the strong.
<sup>16</sup> Thus the poor have expectancy, and unrighteousness shuts her mouth.
<sup>17</sup> Look, blessed is the man whom Eloah does reprove, so do not despise the discipline of the Almighty.
<sup>18</sup> For He bruises, but He binds up; He smites, but His hands heal.
<sup>19</sup> In six distresses He delivers you, and in seven no evil strikes you.
<sup>20</sup> In scarcity of food He shall redeem you from death, and in battle from the power of the sword.
<sup>21</sup> When the tongue scourges you are shielded, and you have no fear when destruction comes.
<sup>22</sup> At destruction and at starvation you laugh, and you have no fear of the beasts of the earth.
<sup>23</sup> For your covenant is with the stones of the field, and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with you.
<sup>24</sup> And you shall know that your tent is in peace, and shall visit your tent and not sin,
<sup>25</sup> and shall know that your seed are many, and your offspring like the grass of the earth.
<sup>26</sup> You shall come to the grave in ripe old age, like the stacking of grain in its season.
<sup>27</sup> Look, this we have searched out, it is so. Hear it, and know for yourself.”
