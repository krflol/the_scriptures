<sup>1</sup> And Bildaḏ the Shuḥite answered and said,
<sup>2</sup> “When do you put an end to words? Understand, and let us then talk.
<sup>3</sup> Why should we be reckoned as beasts, as stupid in your eyes?
<sup>4</sup> You who tear yourself to pieces in displeasure – would the earth be forsaken for your sake? Or the rock move from its place?
<sup>5</sup> Indeed, the light of the wrong goes out, and the flame of his fire does not shine.
<sup>6</sup> The light shall be dark in his tent, and his lamp beside him is put out.
<sup>7</sup> The steps of his strength are impeded, and his own counsel overthrows him.
<sup>8</sup> For he is sent into a net by his own feet, and he walks on a pit-fall.
<sup>9</sup> The net seizes his heel, a snare prevails over him.
<sup>10</sup> A noose is hidden on the ground for him, and a trap for him in the path.
<sup>11</sup> Alarms frighten him on all sides, and chase him at his heels.
<sup>12</sup> His strength is starved, and calamity is ready at his side.
<sup>13</sup> It devours parts of his skin, the first-born of death devours his parts.
<sup>14</sup> He is torn from the shelter of his tent, and they parade him before the sovereign of alarms.
<sup>15</sup> In his tent dwells that which is none of his; brimstone is scattered on his house.
<sup>16</sup> His roots below dry up, and his branch is cut off above.
<sup>17</sup> Remembrance of him perishes from the earth, and he has no name on the street.
<sup>18</sup> They thrust him from light into darkness, and chase him out of the world.
<sup>19</sup> He leaves no offspring or descendant among his people, nor any survivor in his dwellings.
<sup>20</sup> Those in the west are astonished at his day, as those in the east are frightened.
<sup>21</sup> Indeed, such are the dwellings of the perverse, and this is the place of him who does not know Ĕl.”
