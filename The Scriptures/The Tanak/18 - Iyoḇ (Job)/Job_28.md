<sup>1</sup> “Indeed, there is a mine for silver, and a place where gold is refined.
<sup>2</sup> Iron is taken from the earth, and copper is smelted from ore.
<sup>3</sup> An end to darkness he has set, and to every limit he is searching, to rocks in deepest darkness.
<sup>4</sup> He opens a shaft far away from people; they are forgotten by feet; they hang far away from men; they swing to and fro.
<sup>5</sup> Earth, out of which grows food, is turned underneath as by fire;
<sup>6</sup> its stones are the place of sapphires, and it has dust of gold.
<sup>7</sup> No bird of prey knows the path, nor has the hawk’s eye seen it.
<sup>8</sup> The proud beasts have not trodden it, nor has the fierce lion passed over it.
<sup>9</sup> He puts his hand on the flint; he shall overturn the mountains at the roots.
<sup>10</sup> He cuts out channels in the rocks, and his eye sees every precious gem.
<sup>11</sup> He dams up the sources of the rivers; and he brings to light what is hidden.
<sup>12</sup> And wisdom – where is it found? And where is the place of understanding?
<sup>13</sup> Man does not know its value, and it is not found in the land of the living.
<sup>14</sup> The deep has said, ‘It is not in me,’ and the sea has said, ‘It is not with me.’
<sup>15</sup> Gold is not given for it, nor is silver weighed out as its price.
<sup>16</sup> It is not valued in the gold of Ophir, in precious shoham or sapphire.
<sup>17</sup> Gold or crystal are not to be compared with it, nor is it exchanged for a vessel of fine gold.
<sup>18</sup> No mention is made of coral or crystal, for the price of wisdom is above rubies.
<sup>19</sup> The topaz of Kush is not to be compared with it, nor is it valued in clean gold.
<sup>20</sup> And wisdom – from where does it come? And where is the place of understanding?
<sup>21</sup> It has been hidden from the eyes of all living, and concealed from the birds of the heavens.
<sup>22</sup> Destruction and death have said, ‘With our ears we have heard a report of it.’
<sup>23</sup> Elohim has understood its way, and He has known its place.
<sup>24</sup> For He looks to the ends of the earth, sees under all the heavens,
<sup>25</sup> making a weight for the wind, and measuring out the waters by measure.
<sup>26</sup> When He made a law for the rain, and a way for the lightning of thunder,
<sup>27</sup> then He saw wisdom and declared it; He prepared it and also searched it out.
<sup>28</sup> And He said to man, ‘See, the fear of יהוה, that is wisdom, and to turn from evil is understanding.’ ”
