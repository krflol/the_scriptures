<sup>1</sup> And the young Shemu’ĕl was serving יהוה before Ĕli. And the word of יהוה was rare in those days – no vision breaking forth.
<sup>2</sup> And it came to be in that day, that Ĕli was lying down in his place. And his eyes had begun to grow so dim that he was unable to see,
<sup>3</sup> And the lamp of Elohim had not gone out in the Hĕḵal of יהוה where the ark of Elohim was, and Shemu’ĕl was lying down to sleep.
<sup>4</sup> And יהוה called Shemu’ĕl, and he answered, “Here I am!”
<sup>5</sup> He then ran to Ĕli and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” But he said, “I did not call – lie down again.” So he went and lay down.
<sup>6</sup> And יהוה again called, “Shemu’ĕl!” And Shemu’ĕl arose and went to Ĕli, and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” But he answered, “My son, I did not call – lie down again.”
<sup>7</sup> Now Shemu’ĕl did not yet know יהוה, and the word of יהוה was not yet revealed to him.
<sup>8</sup> And יהוה called Shemu’ĕl again the third time, and he arose and went to Ĕli, and said, “Here I am, for you did call me.” Then Ĕli understood that יהוה had called the youth.
<sup>9</sup> So Ĕli said to Shemu’ĕl, “Go, lie down. And it shall be, if He calls you, say, ‘Speak, יהוה, for Your servant hears.’ ” And Shemu’ĕl went and lay down in his place.
<sup>10</sup> And יהוה came and stood and called as at other times, “Shemu’ĕl! Shemu’ĕl!” And Shemu’ĕl answered, “Speak, for Your servant hears.”
<sup>11</sup> And יהוה said to Shemu’ĕl, “See, I am doing a matter in Yisra’ĕl at which both ears of everyone who hears it shall tingle.
<sup>12</sup> “In that day I shall confirm against Ĕli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from beginning to end.
<sup>13</sup> “For I have declared to him that I am judging his house forever for the crookedness which he knows, because his sons cursed Elohim, and he did not rebuke them.
<sup>14</sup> “And therefore I have sworn to the house of Ĕli that the crookedness of the house of Ĕli shall never be atoned for, by slaughtering or grain offering.”
<sup>15</sup> And Shemu’ĕl lay down until morning, and opened the doors of the House of יהוה. And Shemu’ĕl was afraid to report the vision to Ĕli.
<sup>16</sup> Then Ĕli called Shemu’ĕl and said, “Shemu’ĕl, my son!” And he answered, “Here I am.”
<sup>17</sup> And he said, “What is the word that He spoke to you? Please do not hide it from me. Elohim do so to you, and more also, if you hide a word from me of all the words that He spoke to you.”
<sup>18</sup> And Shemu’ĕl reported to him all the words, and hid none from him. And he said, “It is יהוה. Let Him do what is good in His eyes.”
<sup>19</sup> And Shemu’ĕl grew up, and יהוה was with him and did not let any of his words fall to the ground.
<sup>20</sup> And all Yisra’ĕl from Dan to Be’ĕrsheḇa knew that Shemu’ĕl had been established as a prophet of יהוה.
<sup>21</sup> And יהוה continued to appear in Shiloh, because יהוה revealed Himself to Shemu’ĕl in Shiloh by the word of יהוה.
