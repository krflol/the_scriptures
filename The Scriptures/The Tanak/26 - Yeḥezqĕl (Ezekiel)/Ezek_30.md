<sup>1</sup> And the word of יהוה came to me, saying,
<sup>2</sup> “Son of man, prophesy and say, ‘Thus said the Master יהוה, “Howl, ‘Woe to the day!’
<sup>3</sup> “For the day is near, even the day of יהוה is near. It is a day of clouds, the time of the nations.
<sup>4</sup> “The sword shall come upon Mitsrayim, and great anguish shall be in Kush, when the slain fall in Mitsrayim, and they take away her wealth, and her foundations are broken down.
<sup>5</sup> “Kush, and Put, and Luḏ, all the mixed people, and Kuḇ, and the sons of the land of the covenant, shall fall with them by the sword.”
<sup>6</sup> ‘Thus said יהוה, “Those who lean on Mitsrayim shall fall, and the pride of her power shall come down. From Miḡdol to Sewĕnĕh those within her shall fall by the sword,” declares the Master יהוה.
<sup>7</sup> “They shall be ruined amidst the wasted lands, and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are dried up.
<sup>8</sup> “And they shall know that I am יהוה, when I have set a fire in Mitsrayim and all her helpers are crushed.
<sup>9</sup> “On that day messengers shall go forth before Me in ships to make the complacent Kushites afraid, and great anguish shall come upon them, as on the day of Mitsrayim – for look, it is coming!”
<sup>10</sup> ‘Thus said the Master יהוה, “I shall cause the crowd of Mitsrayim to cease, by the hand of Neḇuḵaḏretstsar sovereign of Baḇel.
<sup>11</sup> “He and his people with him, the ruthless ones of the nations, are brought to destroy the land. And they shall draw their swords against Mitsrayim, and shall fill the land with the slain.
<sup>12</sup> “And I shall make the rivers dry, and I shall sell the land into the hand of evil ones. And I shall lay the land waste, and all that is in it, by the hand of foreigners. I, יהוה, have spoken.”
<sup>13</sup> ‘Thus said the Master יהוה, “And I shall destroy the idols, and make an end of the images in Noph, and there shall no longer be a prince from the land of Mitsrayim, and I shall put fear in the land of Mitsrayim.
<sup>14</sup> “And I shall make Pathros a waste, and I shall set fire to Tso‛an, and I shall execute judgments in No.
<sup>15</sup> “And I shall pour out My wrath on Sin, the stronghold of Mitsrayim. And I shall cut off the crowd of No.
<sup>16</sup> “And I shall set a fire in Mitsrayim, Sin shall writhe in anguish, No is to be split open, and Noph has adversaries daily.
<sup>17</sup> “The young men of Awen and Pi Ḇeseth shall fall by the sword, while these cities go into captivity.
<sup>18</sup> “And in Teḥaphneḥes the day shall be darkened, when I shatter the yokes of Mitsrayim there. And the pride of her strength shall cease in her, a cloud shall cover her. And her daughters shall go into captivity.
<sup>19</sup> “And I shall execute judgments on Mitsrayim, and they shall know that I am יהוה.” ’ ”
<sup>20</sup> And it came to be in the eleventh year, in the first month, on the seventh of the month, that the word of יהוה came to me, saying,
<sup>21</sup> “Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh sovereign of Mitsrayim. And see, it has not been bound up for healing, to put a bandage to bind it, to make it strong to hold a sword.
<sup>22</sup> “Therefore thus said the Master יהוה, ‘See, I am against Pharaoh sovereign of Mitsrayim, and shall break his arms, both the strong one and the one that was broken, and shall make the sword fall out of his hand,
<sup>23</sup> and shall scatter the Mitsrites among the nations, and disperse them throughout the lands,
<sup>24</sup> and strengthen the arms of the sovereign of Baḇel. And I shall put My sword in his hand. And I shall break Pharaoh’s arms, and he shall groan before him with the groanings of the slain before him.
<sup>25</sup> ‘And I shall strengthen the arms of the sovereign of Baḇel, but the arms of Pharaoh shall fall. And they shall know that I am יהוה, when I put My sword into the hand of the sovereign of Baḇel and he shall stretch it out against the land of Mitsrayim.
<sup>26</sup> ‘And I shall scatter the Mitsrites among the nations, and I shall disperse them throughout the lands. And they shall know that I am יהוה.’ ”
