<sup>1</sup> And the word of יהוה came to me, saying,
<sup>2</sup> “Son of man, set your face against the Ammonites, and prophesy against them.
<sup>3</sup> “And you shall say to the Ammonites, ‘Hear the word of the Master יהוה ! Thus said the Master יהוה, “Because you said, ‘Aha!’ against My set-apart place when it was profaned, and against the land of Yisra’ĕl when it was ruined, and against the house of Yehuḏah when they went into exile,
<sup>4</sup> therefore, see, I am giving you as a possession to the men of the East, and they shall set their encampments among you and make their dwellings among you – they shall eat your fruit, and they shall drink your milk.
<sup>5</sup> “And I shall make Rabbah a pasture for camels and Ammon a resting place for flocks. And you shall know that I am יהוה.”
<sup>6</sup> ‘For this is what the Master יהוה said, “Because you clapped your hands, and you stamped your feet, and rejoiced with all the scorn of your being against the land of Yisra’ĕl,
<sup>7</sup> therefore see, I Myself shall stretch out My hand against you, and give you as plunder to the nations. And I shall cut you off from the peoples, and make you perish from the lands. I shall destroy you, and you shall know that I am יהוה.”
<sup>8</sup> ‘This is what the Master יהוה said, “Because Mo’aḇ and Sĕ‛ir say, ‘See, the house of Yehuḏah is like all the gentiles,’
<sup>9</sup> therefore, see, I am opening the flank of Mo’aḇ on the side of the cities, on the side of his cities on its frontiers, the splendour of the land, Bĕyth Yeshimoth, Ba‛al Me‛on, and Qiryathayim,
<sup>10</sup> and I shall give it, together with the Ammonites, as a possession to the men of the East, so that the Ammonites are no more remembered among the nations.
<sup>11</sup> “Also on Mo’aḇ I execute judgments, and they shall know that I am יהוה.”
<sup>12</sup> ‘Thus said the Master יהוה, “Because of what Eḏom has done against the house of Yehuḏah by taking vengeance, so that they became very guilty, and they have taken vengeance on them,”
<sup>13</sup> therefore thus said the Master יהוה, “I shall stretch out My hand against Eḏom, and I shall cut off man and beast from it and lay it waste – from Tĕman even to Deḏan they shall fall by the sword.
<sup>14</sup> “And I shall lay My vengeance on Eḏom by the hand of My people Yisra’ĕl. And they shall do in Eḏom according to My displeasure and according to My wrath. So they shall know My vengeance,” declares the Master יהוה.
<sup>15</sup> ‘Thus said the Master יהוה, “Because the Philistines have acted in vengeance, and took vengeance with scorn in their being, to destroy with lasting enmity,”
<sup>16</sup> therefore thus said the Master יהוה, “See, I am stretching out My hand against the Philistines, and I shall cut off the Kerĕthites and destroy the remnant of the seacoast,
<sup>17</sup> and execute great vengeance on them with raging reproofs. And they shall know that I am יהוה, when I lay My vengeance upon them.” ’ ”
