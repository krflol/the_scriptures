<sup>1</sup> And the word of יהוה came to me, saying,
<sup>2</sup> “Son of man, say to the prince of Tsor, ‘Thus said the Master יהוה, “Because your heart is lifted up, and you say, ‘I am Ĕl, I sit in the seat of Elohim, in the heart of the seas,’ whereas you are a man, and not Ĕl, though you set your heart as the heart of Elohim!
<sup>3</sup> “Look, are you wiser than Dani’ĕl? Has no secret been hidden from you?
<sup>4</sup> “By your wisdom and your understanding you have made riches for yourself, and gathered gold and silver into your treasuries.
<sup>5</sup> “By your great wisdom, by your trade you have increased your riches, and your heart is lifted up because of your riches.”
<sup>6</sup> ‘Therefore thus said the Master יהוה, “Because you have set your heart as the heart of Elohim,
<sup>7</sup> therefore see, I am bringing against you strangers, the ruthless ones of the nations. And they shall draw their swords against the loveliness of your wisdom, and they shall profane your splendour.
<sup>8</sup> “Down into the Pit they shall bring you, and you shall die the death of the slain in the heart of the seas.
<sup>9</sup> “Would you still say before him who slays you, ‘I am Elohim’, whereas you are man, and not Ĕl, in the hand of him who slays you?
<sup>10</sup> “The death of the uncircumcised you shall die, by the hand of foreigners. For I have spoken,” declares the Master יהוה.’ ”
<sup>11</sup> And the word of יהוה came to me, saying,
<sup>12</sup> “Son of man, take up a lamentation for the sovereign of Tsor, and you shall say to him, ‘Thus said the Master יהוה, “You were sealing up a pattern, complete in wisdom and perfect in loveliness.
<sup>13</sup> “You were in Ĕḏen, the garden of Elohim. Every precious stone was your covering: the ruby, topaz, and diamond, beryl, shoham, and jasper, sapphire, turquoise, and emerald and gold. The workmanship of your settings and mountings was prepared for you on the day you were created.
<sup>14</sup> “You were the anointed keruḇ that covered. And I placed you, you were on the set-apart mountain of Elohim. You walked up and down in the midst of stones of fire.
<sup>15</sup> “You were perfect in your ways from the day you were created, until unrighteousness was found in you.
<sup>16</sup> “By the greatness of your trade you became filled with violence within, and you sinned. So I thrust you from the mountain of Elohim, and I destroyed you, O covering keruḇ, from the midst of the stones of fire.
<sup>17</sup> “Your heart was lifted up because of your loveliness, you corrupted your wisdom for the sake of your splendour. I threw you to the earth, I laid you before sovereigns, to look at you.
<sup>18</sup> “You profaned your set-apart places by your many crookednesses, by the unrighteousness of your trading. Therefore I brought forth fire from your midst. It has devoured you, and I turned you to ashes upon the earth before the eyes of all who see you.
<sup>19</sup> “All who knew you among the peoples were astonished at you. Waste you shall be, and cease to be, forever.” ’ ”
<sup>20</sup> And the word of יהוה came to me, saying,
<sup>21</sup> “Son of man, set your face toward Tsiḏon, and prophesy against her,
<sup>22</sup> and you shall say, ‘Thus said the Master יהוה, “See, I am against you, O Tsiḏon, and I shall be esteemed in your midst. And they shall know that I am יהוה, when I execute judgments in her. And I shall be set-apart in her.
<sup>23</sup> “And I shall send pestilence upon her, and blood in her streets. And the slain shall fall in her midst by the sword against her, from all sides. And they shall know that I am יהוה.
<sup>24</sup> “And there shall no longer be a pricking brier or a paining thorn for the house of Yisra’ĕl from among all who are around them, who despise them. And they shall know that I am the Master יהוה.”
<sup>25</sup> ‘Thus said the Master יהוה, “When I have gathered the house of Yisra’ĕl from the peoples among whom they are scattered, I shall be set-apart in them before the eyes of the gentiles. And they shall dwell in their own land which I gave to My servant Ya‛aqoḇ.
<sup>26</sup> “And they shall dwell safely, and build houses, and plant vineyards, and dwell safely, when I execute judgments on all those around them who despise them. And they shall know that I am יהוה their Elohim.” ’ ”
