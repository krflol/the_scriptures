<sup>5</sup> “Thus said the Master יהוה, ‘This is Yerushalayim which I have set in the midst of the gentiles, with the other lands all around her.
<sup>6</sup> ‘But she rebelled against My rightrulings, doing wrong, more than the gentiles, and My laws more than the lands all around her. For they have rejected My right-rulings, and they have not walked in My laws.’

<sup>14</sup> ‘And I shall make you a waste and a reproach among the gentiles that are all around you, before the eyes of all who pass by.
<sup>15</sup> ‘And it shall be a reproach, an object of scorn, a warning, and an astonishment to the gentiles that are all around you, when I execute judgments among you in displeasure and in wrath and in heated chastisements. I, יהוה, have spoken.
<sup>16</sup> ‘When I send against them the evil arrows of scarcity of food which shall be for their destruction, which I send to destroy you, I shall increase the scarcity of food upon you and cut off your supply of bread.
<sup>17</sup> ‘And I shall send against you scarcity of food and evil beasts, and they shall bereave you. And pestilence and blood shall pass through you, while I bring the sword against you. I, יהוה, have spoken.’ ”
