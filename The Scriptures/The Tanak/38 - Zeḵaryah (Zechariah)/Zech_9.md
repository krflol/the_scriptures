<sup>1</sup> The message of the word of יהוה against the land of Ḥaḏraḵ, and Damascus its resting place – when the eye of man and all the tribes of Yisra’ĕl are on יהוה –
<sup>2</sup> and Ḥamath also borders on it, Tsor and Tsiḏon, though they are very wise.
<sup>3</sup> For Tsor built herself a tower, heaped up silver like the dust, and gold like the mud of the streets.
<sup>4</sup> See, יהוה shall dispossess her, and He shall destroy her power in the sea, and she shall be consumed by fire.
<sup>5</sup> Ashqelon sees it and fears, Azzah too, writhing in anguish, and Eqron, for her expectation has dried up. And the sovereign shall perish from Azzah, and Ashqelon shall not be inhabited.
<sup>6</sup> “And a half-breed shall settle in Ashdoḏ. So I shall cut off the pride of the Philistines,
<sup>7</sup> and shall take away his blood from his mouth, and the abominations from between his teeth. And he shall remain, even he, to our Elohim, and he shall be like a leader in Yehuḏah, and Eqron like a Yeḇusite.
<sup>8</sup> And I shall encamp around My house, against an army, against him who passes by and him who returns, so that no oppressor passes through them again, for now I have seen with My eyes.
<sup>9</sup> “Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Tsiyon! Shout, O daughter of Yerushalayim! See, your Sovereign is coming to you, He is righteous and endowed with deliverance, humble and riding on a donkey, a colt, the foal of a donkey.
<sup>10</sup> “And I shall cut off the chariot from Ephrayim and the horse from Yerushalayim. And the battle bow shall be cut off. And He shall speak peace to the nations, and His rule is from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth.
<sup>11</sup> “Also you, because of the blood of your covenant, I shall send your prisoners out of the pit.
<sup>12</sup> “Return to the stronghold, you prisoners of the expectation. Even today I declare that I return double to you.
<sup>13</sup> “For I shall bend Yehuḏah for Me, I shall fill the bow with Ephrayim, and I shall stir up your sons, O Tsiyon, against your sons, O Greece, and I shall make you like the sword of a mighty man.”
<sup>14</sup> And יהוה shall appear for them, and His arrow go forth like lightning, and the Master יהוה sound the ram’s horn. And He shall go with whirlwinds from the south,
<sup>15</sup> יהוה of hosts shall shield them. And they shall devour and trample on sling stones. And they shall drink, roar as if with wine, and they shall be filled like basins, like the corners of the altar.
<sup>16</sup> And יהוה their Elohim shall save them in that day, as the flock of His people, for the stones of a diadem, sparkling over His land.
<sup>17</sup> For what goodness is His, and what comeliness is His. Grain make the young men thrive, and new wine the maidens!
