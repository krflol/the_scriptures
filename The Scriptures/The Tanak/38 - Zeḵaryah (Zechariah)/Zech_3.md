<sup>1</sup> And he showed me Yehoshua the high priest standing before the messenger of יהוה, and Satan standing at his right hand to be an adversary to him.
<sup>2</sup> And יהוה said to Satan, “ יהוה rebuke you, Satan! יהוה who has chosen Yerushalayim rebuke you! Is this not a brand plucked from the fire?”
<sup>3</sup> And Yehoshua was dressed in filthy garments, and was standing before the messenger.
<sup>4</sup> And He answered and spoke to those who stood before Him, saying, “Remove the filthy garments from him.” And to him He said, “See, I have removed your guilt from you, and shall put costly robes on you.”
<sup>5</sup> And I said, “Let them put a clean turban on his head.” Then they put a clean turban on his head, and they put garments on him. And the messenger of יהוה stood by.
<sup>6</sup> And the messenger of יהוה witnessed to Yehoshua, saying,
<sup>7</sup> “Thus said יהוה of hosts, ‘If you walk in My ways, and if you guard My duty, then you shall also rule My house, and also guard My courts. And I shall give you access among these standing here.
<sup>8</sup> ‘Now listen, Yehoshua the high priest, you and your companions who sit before you, for they are men of symbol. For look, I am bringing forth My Servant – the Branch.
<sup>9</sup> ‘See the stone which I have put before Yehoshua: on one stone are seven eyes. See, I am engraving its inscription,’ declares יהוה of hosts, ‘and I shall remove the guilt of that land in one day.
<sup>10</sup> ‘In that day,’ declares יהוה of hosts, ‘you shall invite one another, under the vine and under the fig tree.’ ”
