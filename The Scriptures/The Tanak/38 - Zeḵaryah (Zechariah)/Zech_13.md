<sup>2</sup> “And it shall be in that day,” declares יהוה of hosts, “that I cut off the names of the idols from the earth, and they shall be remembered no more, and I shall also remove the prophets and the unclean spirit from the earth.
<sup>3</sup> “And it shall be, when one prophesies again, then his father and mother who brought him forth shall say to him, ‘You shall not to live, because you have spoken falsehood in the Name of יהוה.’ And his father and mother who brought him forth shall pierce him through when he prophesies.
<sup>4</sup> “And it shall be in that day that the prophets shall be ashamed, everyone of his vision when he prophesies, and not put a hairy robe on in order to deceive,
<sup>5</sup> but shall say, ‘I am no prophet, I am a farmer, for a man sold me as a slave in my youth.’
<sup>6</sup> “And one shall say to him, ‘What are these wounds in your hands?’ And he shall say, ‘Because I was wounded at home by those who love me.’
<sup>7</sup> “O sword, awake against My Shepherd, against the Man who is My Companion,” declares יהוה of hosts. “Smite the Shepherd, and let the sheep be scattered. But I shall turn My hand upon the little ones.
<sup>8</sup> And it shall be throughout all the soil,” declares יהוה, “that two thirds therein are cut off and die, and one third is left therein.
<sup>9</sup> “And I shall bring the third into fire, and refine them as silver is refined, and try them as gold is tried. They shall call on My Name, and I shall answer them. I shall say, ‘This is My people,’ while they say, ‘ יהוה is my Elohim.’ ”
