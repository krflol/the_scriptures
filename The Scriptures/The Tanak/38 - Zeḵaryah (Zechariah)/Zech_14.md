<sup>1</sup> See, a day shall come for יהוה, and your spoil shall be divided in your midst.
<sup>2</sup> And I shall gather all the gentiles to battle against Yerushalayim. And the city shall be taken, the houses plundered, and the women ravished. Half of the city shall go into exile, but the remnant of the people shall not be cut off from the city.
<sup>3</sup> And יהוה shall go forth, and He shall fight against those gentiles, as He fights in the day of battle.
<sup>4</sup> And in that day His feet shall stand upon the Mount of Olives, which faces Yerushalayim on the east. And the Mount of Olives shall be split in two, from east to west, a very great valley, and half of the mountain shall move toward the north and half of it toward the south.
<sup>5</sup> And you shall flee to the valley of My mountain – for the valley of the mountains reaches to Atsal. And you shall flee as you fled from the earthquake in the days of Uzziyah sovereign of Yehuḏah. And יהוה my Elohim shall come – all the set-apart ones with You.
<sup>6</sup> And in that day it shall be: there is no light, it is dark.
<sup>7</sup> And it shall be one day which is known to יהוה, neither day nor night, but at evening time there shall be light.
<sup>8</sup> And in that day it shall be that living waters flow from Yerushalayim, half of them toward the eastern sea and half of them toward the western sea, in summer as well as in winter.
<sup>9</sup> And יהוה shall be Sovereign over all the earth. In that day there shall be one יהוה, and His Name one.
<sup>10</sup> All the land shall be changed into a desert plain from Geḇa to Rimmon south of Yerushalayim, and she shall be raised up and inhabited in her place from Binyamin’s Gate to the place of the First Gate and the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Ḥanan’ĕl to the winepresses of the sovereign.
<sup>11</sup> And they shall dwell in her, and there shall be no more utter destruction, but Yerushalayim shall be safely inhabited.
<sup>12</sup> And this is the plague with which יהוה plagues all the people who fought against Yerushalayim: their flesh shall decay while they stand on their feet, and their eyes decay in their sockets, and their tongues decay in their mouths.
<sup>13</sup> And it shall be in that day that a great confusion from יהוה is among them, and everyone of them shall seize the hand of his neighbour, and his hand rise up against his neighbour’s hand.
<sup>14</sup> And Yehuḏah shall fight at Yerushalayim as well. And the wealth of all the gentiles round about shall be gathered together: gold, and silver, and garments in great quantities.
<sup>15</sup> So also is the plague on the horse and the mule, on the camel and the donkey, and on all the cattle that are in those camps – as this plague.
<sup>16</sup> And it shall be that all who are left from all the gentiles which came up against Yerushalayim, shall go up from year to year to bow themselves to the Sovereign, יהוה of hosts, and to observe the Festival of Booths.
<sup>17</sup> And it shall be, that if anyone of the clans of the earth does not come up to Yerushalayim to bow himself to the Sovereign, יהוה of hosts, on them there is to be no rain.
<sup>18</sup> And if the clan of Mitsrayim does not come up and enter in, then there is no rain. On them is the plague with which יהוה plagues the gentiles who do not come up to observe the Festival of Booths.
<sup>19</sup> This is the punishment of Mitsrayim and the punishment of all the gentiles that do not come up to observe the Festival of Booths.
<sup>20</sup> In that day “SET-APART TO יהוה ” shall be engraved on the bells of the horses. And the pots in the House of יהוה shall be like the bowls before the altar.
<sup>21</sup> And every pot in Yerushalayim and Yehuḏah shall be set-apart to יהוה of hosts. And all those who slaughter shall come and take them and cook in them. And there shall no longer be a merchant in the House of יהוה of hosts, in that day.
