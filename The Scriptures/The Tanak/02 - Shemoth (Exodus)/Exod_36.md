<sup>1</sup> “And Betsal’ĕl and Oholiaḇ, and every wise-hearted man in whom יהוה has given wisdom and understanding, to know how to do all work for the service of the set-apart place, shall do according to all that יהוה has commanded.”
<sup>2</sup> And Mosheh called Betsal’ĕl and Oholiaḇ, and every wise-hearted man in whose heart יהוה had given wisdom, everyone whose heart lifted him up, to come and do the work.
<sup>3</sup> And they received from Mosheh all the contribution which the children of Yisra’ĕl had brought for the work of the service of making the set-apart place. But they still brought to him voluntary offerings every morning,
<sup>4</sup> so all the craftsmen who were doing all the work of the set-apart place came, each from the work he was doing,
<sup>5</sup> and they spoke to Mosheh, saying, “The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work which יהוה commanded us to do.”
<sup>6</sup> Then Mosheh commanded and they sent this word throughout the camp, saying, “Let neither man nor woman do any more work for the contribution of the set-apart place.” And the people were withheld from bringing,
<sup>7</sup> for what they had was enough for all the work to be done, more than enough.
<sup>8</sup> Then all the wise-hearted ones among them who worked on the Dwelling Place made ten curtains woven of fine linen and blue and purple and scarlet material. They made them with keruḇim, the work of a skilled workman.
<sup>9</sup> The length of each curtain was twenty-eight cubits, and the width of each curtain four cubits, all the curtains having one measure.
<sup>10</sup> And he joined five curtains, one to another; and the other five curtains he joined, one to another.
<sup>11</sup> And he made loops of blue on the edge of the end curtain of one set, the same he did on the edge of the end curtain of the other set.
<sup>12</sup> Fifty loops he made on one curtain, and fifty loops he made on the edge of the end curtain of the second set; the loops held one curtain to another.
<sup>13</sup> And he made fifty hooks of gold, and joined the curtains to each other with the hooks, and the Dwelling Place became one.
<sup>14</sup> And he made curtains of goats’ hair for the tent over the Dwelling Place, he made eleven curtains.
<sup>15</sup> The length of each curtain was thirty cubits, and the width of each curtain four cubits, the eleven curtains having one measure.
<sup>16</sup> And he joined five curtains by themselves and six curtains by themselves.
<sup>17</sup> And he made fifty loops on the edge of the end curtain in one set, and fifty loops he made on the edge of the curtain of the second set.
<sup>18</sup> And he made fifty bronze hooks to join the tent, to be one.
<sup>19</sup> And he made a covering for the tent of rams’ skins, dyed red, and a covering of fine leather above that.
<sup>20</sup> And for the Dwelling Place he made boards of acacia wood, standing up.
<sup>21</sup> The length of each board was ten cubits, and the width of each board a cubit and a half.
<sup>22</sup> Each board had two tenons for binding one to another. So he did to all the boards of the Dwelling Place.
<sup>23</sup> And he made boards for the Dwelling Place, twenty boards for the south side.
<sup>24</sup> And he made forty sockets of silver to go under the twenty boards, and two sockets under each of the boards for its two tenons.
<sup>25</sup> And for the other side of the Dwelling Place, for the north side, he made twenty boards,
<sup>26</sup> and their forty sockets of silver, two sockets under the one board, and two sockets under the other board.
<sup>27</sup> And he made six boards for the west side of the Dwelling Place.
<sup>28</sup> And he made two boards for the two back corners of the Dwelling Place.
<sup>29</sup> And they were double beneath, and similarly they were complete to the top by one ring. So he did to both of them for the two corners.
<sup>30</sup> And there were eight boards, and their silver sockets, sixteen sockets, two sockets under each of the boards.
<sup>31</sup> And he made bars of acacia wood, five for the boards on one side of the Dwelling Place,
<sup>32</sup> and five bars for the boards on the other side of the Dwelling Place, and five bars for the boards of the Dwelling Place at the rear, westward.
<sup>33</sup> And he made the middle bar to pass through the boards from one end to the other.
<sup>34</sup> And he overlaid the boards with gold, and their rings he made of gold to be holders for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.
<sup>35</sup> And he made a veil of blue and purple and scarlet material, and fine worked linen. It was made with keruḇim, the work of a skilled workman.
<sup>36</sup> And he made four columns of acacia wood for it, and overlaid them with gold, with their hooks of gold. And he cast four sockets of silver for them.
<sup>37</sup> And he made a covering for the Tent door of blue and purple and scarlet material and fine woven linen, made by a weaver,
<sup>38</sup> and its five columns with their hooks. And he overlaid their tops and their rings with gold, but their five sockets were of bronze.
