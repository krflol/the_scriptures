<sup>1</sup> And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
<sup>2</sup> “On the first day of the first month, you are to raise up the Dwelling Place of the Tent of Meeting,
<sup>3</sup> and shall put in it the ark of the Witness, and screen the ark with the veil.
<sup>4</sup> “And you shall bring in the table and arrange what belongs on it, and bring in the lampstand and light its lamps.
<sup>5</sup> “And you shall set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the Witness, and put up the covering of the door to the Dwelling Place.
<sup>6</sup> “And you shall set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of the Dwelling Place of the Tent of Meeting,
<sup>7</sup> and shall set the basin between the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and shall put water therein.
<sup>8</sup> “And you shall set up the courtyard all around, and shall place the covering of the courtyard gate,
<sup>9</sup> and shall take the anointing oil, and anoint the Dwelling Place and all that is in it, and shall set it and all its utensils apart, and it shall be set-apart.
<sup>10</sup> “And you shall anoint the altar of the burnt offering and all its utensils, and set the altar apart, and the altar shall be most set-apart.
<sup>11</sup> “And you shall anoint the basin and its stand, and set it apart.
<sup>12</sup> “And you shall bring Aharon and his sons to the door of the Tent of Meeting and wash them with water.
<sup>13</sup> “And you shall put the set-apart garments on Aharon, and anoint him and set him apart to serve as priest to Me.
<sup>14</sup> “And you shall bring his sons and put long shirts on them,
<sup>15</sup> and shall anoint them, as you anointed their father, and they shall serve as priests to Me. And their anointing shall be for them an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.”
<sup>16</sup> And Mosheh did according to all that יהוה had commanded him, so he did.
<sup>17</sup> And it came to be in the first month of the second year, on the first day of the month, that the Dwelling Place was raised up.
<sup>18</sup> And Mosheh raised up the Dwelling Place and placed its sockets, and set up its boards, and put in its bars, and raised up its columns,
<sup>19</sup> and spread the tent over the Dwelling Place and put the covering of the tent on top of it, as יהוה had commanded Mosheh.
<sup>20</sup> And he took the Witness and put it into the ark, and he put the poles through the rings of the ark, and put the lid of atonement on top of the ark,
<sup>21</sup> and brought the ark into the Dwelling Place, and placed the veil of the covering to screen off the ark of the Witness, as יהוה had commanded Mosheh.
<sup>22</sup> And he put the table in the Tent of Meeting, on the north side of the Dwelling Place, outside the veil,
<sup>23</sup> and set the bread in order upon it before יהוה, as יהוה had commanded Mosheh.
<sup>24</sup> And he put the lampstand in the Tent of Meeting, opposite the table, on the south side of the Dwelling Place,
<sup>25</sup> and lit the lamps before יהוה, as יהוה had commanded Mosheh.
<sup>26</sup> And he put the gold altar in the Tent of Meeting in front of the veil,
<sup>27</sup> and burned sweet incense on it, as יהוה had commanded Mosheh.
<sup>28</sup> And he set up the covering to the door of the Dwelling Place.
<sup>29</sup> And he put the altar of burnt offering before the door of the Dwelling Place of the Tent of Meeting, and offered upon it the burnt offering and the grain offering, as יהוה had commanded Mosheh.
<sup>30</sup> And he put the basin between the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and put water therein for washing.
<sup>31</sup> And Mosheh, and Aharon, and his sons washed their hands and their feet with water from it,
<sup>32</sup> as they went into the Tent of Meeting, and as they came near the altar. They would wash, as יהוה had commanded Mosheh.
<sup>33</sup> And he raised up the courtyard all around the Dwelling Place and the altar, and placed the covering of the courtyard gate. And Mosheh completed the work.
<sup>34</sup> And the cloud covered the Tent of Meeting, and the esteem of יהוה filled the Dwelling Place.
<sup>35</sup> And Mosheh was not able to come into the Tent of Meeting, because the cloud dwelt on it, and the esteem of יהוה filled the Dwelling Place.
<sup>36</sup> And when the cloud was taken up from above the Dwelling Place, the children of Yisra’ĕl went onward in all their journeys.
<sup>37</sup> But if the cloud was not taken up, then they did not set out till the day that it was taken up.
<sup>38</sup> For the cloud of יהוה was on the Dwelling Place by day, and fire was on it by night, before the eyes of all the house of Yisra’ĕl, in all their journeys.
