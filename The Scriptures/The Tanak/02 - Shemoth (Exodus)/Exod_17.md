<sup>1</sup> And all the congregation of the children of Yisra’ĕl set out on their journey from the Wilderness of Sin, according to the command of יהוה, and camped in Rephiḏim. And there was no water for the people to drink.
<sup>2</sup> Therefore the people strove with Mosheh, and said, “Give us water to drink.” And Mosheh said to them, “Why do you strive with me? Why do you try יהוה ?”
<sup>3</sup> And the people thirsted there for water, and the people grumbled against Mosheh, and said, “Why did you bring us out of Mitsrayim, to kill us and our children and our livestock with thirst?”
<sup>4</sup> Then Mosheh cried out to יהוה, saying, “What am I to do with this people? Yet a little and they shall stone me!”
<sup>5</sup> And יהוה said to Mosheh, “Pass over before the people, and take with you some of the elders of Yisra’ĕl. And take in your hand your rod with which you smote the river, and go.
<sup>6</sup> “See, I am standing before you there on the rock in Ḥorĕḇ. And you shall smite the rock, and water shall come out of it, and the people shall drink.” And Mosheh did so before the eyes of the elders of Yisra’ĕl.
<sup>7</sup> And he called the name of the place Massah and Meriḇah, because of the ‘strife’ of the children of Yisra’ĕl, and because they ‘tried’ יהוה, saying, “Is יהוה in our midst or not?”
<sup>8</sup> And Amalĕq came and fought with Yisra’ĕl in Rephiḏim.
<sup>9</sup> And Mosheh said to Yehoshua, “Choose for us men and go out, fight with Amalĕq. Tomorrow I am stationing myself on the top of the hill with the rod of Elohim in my hand.”
<sup>10</sup> And Yehoshua did as Mosheh said to him, to fight with Amalĕq. And Mosheh, Aharon, and Ḥur went up to the top of the hill.
<sup>11</sup> And it came to be, when Mosheh held up his hand, that Yisra’ĕl prevailed. And when he let down his hand, Amalĕq prevailed.
<sup>12</sup> But Mosheh’s hands were heavy, so they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat on it. And Aharon and Ḥur supported his hands, one on one side, and the other on the other side. And his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.
<sup>13</sup> And Yehoshua defeated Amalĕq and his people with the edge of the sword.
<sup>14</sup> And יהוה said to Mosheh, “Write this for a remembrance in the book and recite it in the hearing of Yehoshua, that I shall completely blot out the remembrance of Amalĕq from under the heavens.”
<sup>15</sup> And Mosheh built an altar and called its name, יהוה Nissi,
<sup>16</sup> for he said, “Because a hand is on the throne of Yah, יהוה is to fight against Amalĕq, from generation to generation.”
