<sup>1</sup> “And you shall make an altar to burn incense on, make it of acacia wood,
<sup>2</sup> a cubit long and a cubit wide – it is a square – and two cubits high, its horns of the same.
<sup>3</sup> “And you shall overlay its top, and its sides all around, and its horns with clean gold. And you shall make for it a moulding of gold all around.
<sup>4</sup> “And make two gold rings for it, under the moulding on both its sides. Make them on its two sides, and they shall be holders for the poles to lift it with.
<sup>5</sup> “And you shall make the poles of acacia wood, and overlay them with gold.
<sup>6</sup> “And you shall put it before the veil that is before the ark of the Witness, before the lid of atonement that is over the Witness, where I am to meet with you.
<sup>7</sup> “And Aharon shall burn on it sweet incense, morning by morning. As he tends the lamps, he shall burn incense on it.
<sup>8</sup> “And when Aharon lights the lamps between the evenings, he shall burn incense on it – a continual incense before יהוה throughout your generations.
<sup>9</sup> “Do not offer strange incense on it, or a burnt offering, or a grain offering, and do not pour a drink offering on it.
<sup>10</sup> “And Aharon shall make atonement upon its horns once a year with the blood of the sin offering of atonement – once a year he makes atonement upon it throughout your generations. It is most set-apart to יהוה.”
<sup>11</sup> And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
<sup>12</sup> “When you take the census of the children of Yisra’ĕl, to register them, then each one shall give an atonement for his life to יהוה, when you register them, so that there is no plague among them when you register them.
<sup>13</sup> “Everyone among those who are registered is to give this: half a sheqel according to the sheqel of the set-apart place, twenty gĕrahs being a sheqel. The half-sheqel is the contribution to יהוה.
<sup>14</sup> “Everyone passing over to be registered, from twenty years old and above, gives a contribution to יהוה.
<sup>15</sup> “The rich does not give more and the poor does not give less than half a sheqel, when you give a contribution to יהוה, to make atonement for yourselves.
<sup>16</sup> “And you shall take the silver for the atonement from the children of Yisra’ĕl, and give it for the service of the Tent of Meeting. And it shall be to the children of Yisra’ĕl for a remembrance before יהוה, to make atonement for yourselves.”
<sup>17</sup> And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
<sup>18</sup> “And you shall make a basin of bronze, with its stand also of bronze, for washing. And you shall put it between the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and shall put water in it.
<sup>19</sup> “And Aharon and his sons shall wash from it their hands and their feet.
<sup>20</sup> “When they go into the Tent of Meeting, or when they come near the altar to attend, to burn an offering made by fire to יהוה, they wash with water, lest they die.
<sup>21</sup> “And they shall wash their hands and their feet, lest they die. And it shall be a law forever to them, to him and his seed throughout their generations.”
<sup>22</sup> And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
<sup>23</sup> “And take for yourself choice spices, five hundred sheqels of liquid myrrh, and half as much – two hundred and fifty – of sweet-smelling cinnamon, and two hundred and fifty of sweet-smelling cane,
<sup>24</sup> and five hundred of cassia, according to the sheqel of the set-apart place, and a hin of olive oil.
<sup>25</sup> “And you shall make from these a set-apart anointing oil, a compound, blended, the work of a perfumer. It is a set-apart anointing oil.
<sup>26</sup> “And with it you shall anoint the Tent of Meeting and the ark of the Witness,
<sup>27</sup> and the table and all its utensils, and the lampstand and its utensils, and the altar of incense,
<sup>28</sup> and the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, and the basin and its stand.
<sup>29</sup> “And you shall set them apart, and they shall be most set-apart. Whatever touches them is to be set-apart.
<sup>30</sup> “And you shall anoint Aharon and his sons, and set them apart, to serve as priests to Me.
<sup>31</sup> “And speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl, saying, ‘This is a set-apart anointing oil to Me throughout your generations.
<sup>32</sup> ‘It shall not be poured on the flesh of a man, and make no other like it, according to its composition. It is set-apart, it is set-apart to you.
<sup>33</sup> ‘Whoever compounds any like it, or whoever puts any of it on a stranger, shall be cut off from his people.’ ”
<sup>34</sup> And יהוה said to Mosheh, “Take sweet spices, fragrant gum and cinnamon and galbanam, and clear frankincense with these sweet spices, all in equal amounts.
<sup>35</sup> “Then you shall make of these an incense, a compound, work of a perfumer, salted, clean, set-apart.
<sup>36</sup> “And you shall beat some of it very fine, and put some of it before the Witness in the Tent of Meeting where I meet with you, it is most set-apart to you.
<sup>37</sup> “And the incense which you make, do not make any for yourselves, according to its composition, it is set-apart to you for יהוה.
<sup>38</sup> “Whoever makes any like it, to smell it, he shall be cut off from his people.”
