<sup>1</sup> In the third month after the children of Yisra’ĕl had come out of the land of Mitsrayim, on this day they came to the Wilderness of Sinai.
<sup>2</sup> For they set out from Rephiḏim, and had come to the Wilderness of Sinai, and camped in the wilderness. So Yisra’ĕl camped there before the mountain.
<sup>3</sup> And Mosheh went up to Elohim, and יהוה called to him from the mountain, saying, “This is what you are to say to the house of Ya‛aqoḇ, and declare to the children of Yisra’ĕl:
<sup>4</sup> ‘You have seen what I did to the Mitsrites, and how I bore you on eagles’ wings and brought you to Myself.
<sup>5</sup> ‘And now, if you diligently obey My voice, and shall guard My covenant, then you shall be My treasured possession above all the peoples – for all the earth is Mine –
<sup>6</sup> ‘and you shall be to Me a reign of priests and a set-apart nation.’ Those are the words which you are to speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl.”
<sup>7</sup> And Mosheh came and called for the elders of the people, and set before them all these words which יהוה commanded him.
<sup>8</sup> And all the people answered together and said, “All that יהוה has spoken we shall do.” So Mosheh brought back the words of the people to יהוה.
<sup>9</sup> And יהוה said to Mosheh, “See, I am coming to you in the thick cloud, so that the people hear when I speak with you, and believe you forever.” And Mosheh reported the words of the people to יהוה.
<sup>10</sup> And יהוה said to Mosheh, “Go to the people and set them apart today and tomorrow. And they shall wash their garments,
<sup>11</sup> and shall be prepared by the third day. For on the third day יהוה shall come down upon Mount Sinai before the eyes of all the people.
<sup>12</sup> “And you shall make a border for the people all around, saying, ‘Take heed to yourselves that you do not go up to the mountain or touch the border of it. Whoever touches the mountain shall certainly be put to death.
<sup>13</sup> ‘Not a hand is to touch it, but he shall certainly be stoned or shot with an arrow, whether man or beast, he shall not live.’ When the trumpet sounds long, let them come near the mountain.”
<sup>14</sup> And Mosheh came down from the mountain to the people and set the people apart, and they washed their garments.
<sup>15</sup> And he said to the people, “Be prepared by the third day. Do not come near a wife.”
<sup>16</sup> And it came to be, on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud on the mountain. And the sound of the ram’s horn was very loud, and all the people who were in the camp trembled.
<sup>17</sup> And Mosheh brought the people out of the camp to meet with Elohim, and they stood at the foot of the mountain.
<sup>18</sup> And Mount Sinai was in smoke, all of it, because יהוה descended upon it in fire. And its smoke went up like the smoke of a furnace, and all the mountain trembled exceedingly.
<sup>19</sup> And when the blast of the ram’s horn sounded long and became louder and louder, Mosheh spoke, and Elohim answered him by voice.
<sup>20</sup> And יהוה came down upon Mount Sinai, on the top of the mountain. And יהוה called Mosheh to the top of the mountain, and Mosheh went up.
<sup>21</sup> And יהוה said to Mosheh, “Go down, and warn the people, lest they break through unto יהוה to see, and many of them fall.
<sup>22</sup> “And let the priests who come near יהוה set themselves apart too, lest יהוה break out against them.”
<sup>23</sup> And Mosheh said to יהוה, “The people are not able to come up to Mount Sinai, for You warned us, saying, ‘Make a border around the mountain and set it apart.’ ”
<sup>24</sup> And יהוה said to him, “Come, go down and then come up, you and Aharon with you. But do not let the priests and the people break through to come up to יהוה, lest He break out against them.”
<sup>25</sup> And Mosheh went down to the people and spoke to them.
