<sup>1</sup> And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
<sup>2</sup> “Set apart to Me all the first-born, the one opening the womb among the children of Yisra’ĕl, among man and among beast, it is Mine.”
<sup>3</sup> And Mosheh said to the people, “Remember this day in which you went out of Mitsrayim, out of the house of slavery. For by strength of hand יהוה brought you out of this place, and whatever is leavened shall not be eaten.
<sup>4</sup> “Today you are going out, in the month Aḇiḇ.
<sup>5</sup> “And it shall be, when יהוה brings you into the land of the Kena‛anites, and the Ḥittites, and the Amorites, and the Ḥiwwites, and the Yeḇusites, which He swore to your fathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, that you shall keep this service in this month.
<sup>6</sup> “Seven days you eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day is a festival to יהוה.
<sup>7</sup> “Unleavened bread is to be eaten the seven days, and whatever is leavened is not to be seen with you, and leaven is not to be seen with you within all your border.
<sup>8</sup> “And you shall inform your son in that day, saying, ‘It is because of what יהוה did for me when I came up from Mitsrayim.’
<sup>9</sup> “And it shall be as a sign to you on your hand and as a reminder between your eyes, that the Torah of יהוה is to be in your mouth, for with a strong hand יהוה has brought you out of Mitsrayim.
<sup>10</sup> “And you shall guard this law at its appointed time from year to year.
<sup>11</sup> “And it shall be, when יהוה brings you into the land of the Kena‛anites, as He swore to you and your fathers, and gives it to you,
<sup>12</sup> that you shall pass over to יהוה every one opening the womb, and every first-born that comes from your livestock, the males belong to יהוה.
<sup>13</sup> “But every first-born of a donkey you are to ransom with a lamb. And if you do not ransom it, then you shall break its neck. And every first-born of man among your sons you are to ransom.
<sup>14</sup> “And it shall be, when your son asks you in time to come, saying, ‘What is this?’ then you shall say to him, ‘By strength of hand יהוה brought us out of Mitsrayim, out of the house of bondage.
<sup>15</sup> ‘And it came to be, when Pharaoh was too hardened to let us go, that יהוה killed every first-born in the land of Mitsrayim, both the first-born of man and the first-born of beast. Therefore I am slaughtering to יהוה every male that open the womb, but every first-born of my sons I ransom.’
<sup>16</sup> “And it shall be as a sign on your hand and as frontlets between your eyes, for by strength of hand יהוה brought us out of Mitsrayim.”
<sup>17</sup> And it came to be, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that Elohim did not lead them by way of the land of the Philistines, though that was nearer, for Elohim said, “Lest the people regret when they see fighting, and return to Mitsrayim.”
<sup>18</sup> So Elohim led the people around by way of the wilderness of the Sea of Reeds. And the children of Yisra’ĕl went up armed from the land of Mitsrayim.
<sup>19</sup> And Mosheh took the bones of Yosĕph with him, for he certainly made the children of Yisra’ĕl swear, saying, “Elohim shall certainly visit you, and you shall bring my bones from here with you.”
<sup>20</sup> And they departed from Sukkoth and camped in Ĕtham at the edge of the wilderness.
<sup>21</sup> And יהוה went before them by day in a column of cloud to lead the way, and by night in a column of fire to give them light, so as to go by day and night.
<sup>22</sup> The column of cloud did not cease by day, nor the column of fire by night, before the people.
