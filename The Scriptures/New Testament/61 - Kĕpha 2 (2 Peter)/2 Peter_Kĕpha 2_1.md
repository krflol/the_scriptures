<sup>1</sup> Shim‛on Kĕpha, a servant and emissary of יהושע Messiah, to those who have obtained a belief as precious as ours by the righteousness of our Elohim and Saviour יהושע Messiah:

<sup>2</sup> Favour and peace be increased to you in the knowledge of Elohim and of יהושע our Master,

<sup>3</sup> as His Mighty-like power has given to us all we need for life and reverence, through the knowledge of Him who called us to esteem and uprightness.

<sup>4</sup> Through these there have been given to us exceedingly great and precious promises, so that through these you might be partakers of the Mighty-like nature, having escaped from the corruption in the world, caused by lust.

<sup>5</sup> And for this reason do your utmost to add to your belief uprightness, to uprightness knowledge,

<sup>6</sup> to knowledge self-control, to self-control endurance, to endurance reverence,

<sup>7</sup> to reverence brotherly affection, and to brotherly affection love.

<sup>8</sup> For if these are in you and increase, they cause you to be neither inactive nor without fruit in the knowledge of our Master יהושע Messiah.

<sup>9</sup> For he in whom these are not present is blind, being shortsighted, and has forgotten that he has been cleansed from his old sins.

<sup>10</sup> For this reason, brothers, all the more do your utmost to make firm your calling and choosing, for if you are doing these matters you shall never stumble at all,

<sup>11</sup> for in this way an entrance into the everlasting reign of our Master and Saviour יהושע Messiah shall be richly supplied to you.

<sup>12</sup> And so I intend to remind you of these matters again and again, though you know them and have been established in the present truth.

<sup>13</sup> But I think it is right, as long as I am in this tent, to stir you up by a reminder,

<sup>14</sup> knowing that the putting off of my tent is soon, even as our Master יהושע Messiah made clear to me.

<sup>15</sup> And I shall do my utmost also, to see to it that you always have a reminder of these matters after my departure.

<sup>16</sup> For we did not follow cleverly devised stories when we made known to you the power and coming of our Master יהושע Messiah, but were eye-witnesses of His superbness.

<sup>17</sup> For when He received respect and esteem from Elohim the Father, such a voice came to Him from the Excellent Esteem, “This is My Son, the Beloved in whom I did delight.”

<sup>18</sup> And we heard this voice which came from heaven when we were with Him on the set-apart mountain.

<sup>19</sup> And we have the prophetic word made more certain, which you do well to heed as a light that shines in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts,

<sup>20</sup> knowing this first, that no prophecy of Scripture came to be of one’s own interpretation,

<sup>21</sup> for prophecy never came by the desire of man, but men of Elohim spoke, being moved by the Set-apart Spirit.
