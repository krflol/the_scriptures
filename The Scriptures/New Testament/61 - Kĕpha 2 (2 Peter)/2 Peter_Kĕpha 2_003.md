<sup>1</sup> This is now, beloved ones, the second letter I write to you, in which I stir up your sincere mind, to remember

<sup>2</sup> the words previously spoken by the set-apart prophets, and of the command of the Master and Saviour, spoken by your emissaries,

<sup>3</sup> knowing this first: that mockers shall come in the last days with mocking, walking according to their own lusts,

<sup>4</sup> and saying, “Where is the promise of His coming? For since the fathers fell asleep, all continues as from the beginning of creation.”

<sup>5</sup> For they choose to have this hidden from them: that the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of water and in the water, by the Word of Elohim,

<sup>6</sup> through which the world at that time was destroyed, being flooded with water.

<sup>7</sup> And the present heavens and the earth are treasured up by the same Word, being kept for fire, to a day of judgment and destruction of wicked men.

<sup>8</sup> But, beloved ones, let not this one matter be hidden from you: that with יהוה one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.

<sup>9</sup> יהוה is not slow in regard to the promise, as some count slowness, but is patient toward us, not wishing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance.

<sup>10</sup> But the day of יהוה shall come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with intense heat, and the earth and the works that are in it shall be burned up.

<sup>11</sup> Seeing all these are to be destroyed in this way, what kind of people ought you to be in set-apart behaviour and reverence,

<sup>12</sup> looking for and hastening the coming of the day of Elohim, through which the heavens shall be destroyed, being set on fire, and the elements melt with intense heat!

<sup>13</sup> But according to His promise we wait for a renewed heavens and a renewed earth in which righteousness dwells.

<sup>14</sup> So then, beloved ones, looking forward to this, do your utmost to be found by Him in peace, spotless and blameless,

<sup>15</sup> and reckon the patience of our Master as deliverance, as also our beloved brother Sha’ul wrote to you, according to the wisdom given to him,

<sup>16</sup> as also in all his letters, speaking in them concerning these matters, in which some are hard to understand, which those who are untaught and unstable twist to their own destruction, as they do also the other Scriptures.

<sup>17</sup> You, then, beloved ones, being forewarned, watch, lest you also fall from your own steadfastness, being led away with the delusion of the lawless,

<sup>18</sup> but grow in the favour and knowledge of our Master and Saviour יהושע Messiah. To Him be the esteem both now and to a day that abides. Amĕn.
