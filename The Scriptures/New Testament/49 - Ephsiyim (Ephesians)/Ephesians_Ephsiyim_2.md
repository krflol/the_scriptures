<sup>1</sup> And you were dead in trespasses and sins,

<sup>2</sup> in which you once walked according to the course of this world, according to the ruler of the authority of the air, of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience,

<sup>3</sup> among whom also we all once lived in the lusts of our flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, as also the rest.

<sup>4</sup> But Elohim, who is rich in compassion, because of His great love with which He loved us,

<sup>5</sup> even when we were dead in trespasses, made us alive together with Messiah – by favour you have been saved –

<sup>6</sup> and raised us up together, and made us sit together in the heavenlies in Messiah יהושע,

<sup>7</sup> in order to show in the coming ages the exceeding riches of His favour in kindness toward us in Messiah יהושע.

<sup>8</sup> For by favour you have been saved, through belief, and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of Elohim,

<sup>9</sup> it is not by works, so that no one should boast.

<sup>10</sup> For we are His workmanship, created in Messiah יהושע unto good works, which Elohim prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.

<sup>11</sup> Therefore remember that you, once gentiles in the flesh, who are called ‘the uncircumcision’ by what is called ‘the circumcision’ made in the flesh by hands,

<sup>12</sup> that at that time you were without Messiah, excluded from the citizenship of Yisra’ĕl and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no expectation and without Elohim in the world.

<sup>13</sup> But now in Messiah יהושע you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of the Messiah.

<sup>14</sup> For He is our peace, who has made both one, and having broken down the partition of the barrier,

<sup>15</sup> having abolished in His flesh the enmity – the Torah of the commands in dogma – so as to create in Himself one renewed man from the two, thus making peace,

<sup>16</sup> and to completely restore to favour both of them unto Elohim in one body through the stake, having destroyed the enmity by it.

<sup>17</sup> And having come, He brought as Good News peace to you who were far off, and peace to those near.

<sup>18</sup> Because through Him we both have access to the Father by one Spirit.

<sup>19</sup> So then you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the set-apart ones and members of the household of Elohim,

<sup>20</sup> having been built upon the foundation of the emissaries and prophets, יהושע Messiah Himself being chief corner-stone,

<sup>21</sup> in whom all the building, being joined together, grows into a set-apart Dwelling Place in יהוה,

<sup>22</sup> in whom you also are being built together into a dwelling of Elohim in the Spirit.
