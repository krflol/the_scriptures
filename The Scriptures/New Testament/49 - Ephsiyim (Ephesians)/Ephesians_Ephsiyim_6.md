<sup>1</sup> Children, obey your parents in the Master, for this is right.

<sup>2</sup> “Respect your father and mother,” which is the first command with promise,

<sup>3</sup> in order that it might be well with you, and you might live long on the earth.”

<sup>4</sup> And you, fathers, do not provoke your children, but bring them up in the instruction and admonition of the Master.

<sup>5</sup> Servants, obey your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in sincerity of heart, as to Messiah;

<sup>6</sup> not with eye-service as men-pleasers, but as servants of Messiah, doing the desire of Elohim from the inner self,

<sup>7</sup> rendering service with pleasure, as to the Master, and not to men,

<sup>8</sup> knowing that whatever good anyone does, he shall receive the same from the Master, whether he is slave or free.

<sup>9</sup> And, masters, do the same to them, refrain from threatening, knowing that your own Master also is in the heavens, and there is no partiality with Him.

<sup>10</sup> For the rest, my brothers, be strong in the Master and in the mightiness of His strength.

<sup>11</sup> Put on the complete armour of Elohim, for you to have power to stand against the schemes of the devil.

<sup>12</sup> Because we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against authorities, against the world-rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual matters of wickedness in the heavenlies.

<sup>13</sup> Because of this, take up the complete armour of Elohim, so that you have power to withstand in the wicked day, and having done all, to stand.

<sup>14</sup> Stand, then, having girded your waist with truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness,

<sup>15</sup> and having fitted your feet with the preparation of the Good News of peace;

<sup>16</sup> above all, having taken up the shield of belief with which you shall have power to quench all the burning arrows of the wicked one.

<sup>17</sup> Take also the helmet of deliverance, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of Elohim,

<sup>18</sup> praying at all times, with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, watching in all perseverance and supplication for all the set-apart ones;

<sup>19</sup> also for me, that a word might be given to me in the opening of my mouth, to be bold in making known the secret of the Good News,

<sup>20</sup> for which I am an envoy in chains, that in it I might speak boldly, as I should speak.

<sup>21</sup> Now, in order that you also might know about me, how I am doing, Tuchikos, a beloved brother and trustworthy servant in the Master, shall make all matters known to you,

<sup>22</sup> whom I did send to you for this same purpose, so that you know about us, and might encourage your hearts.

<sup>23</sup> Peace to the brothers, and love, with belief, from Elohim the Father and the Master יהושע Messiah.

<sup>24</sup> Favour be with all those who love our Master יהושע Messiah, undecayingly! Amĕn.
