<sup>1</sup> Because of this I, Sha’ul, am the prisoner of יהושע Messiah on behalf of you gentiles –

<sup>2</sup> if indeed you have heard of the administration of the favour of Elohim that was given to me for you,

<sup>3</sup> that by revelation was made known to me the secret, as I wrote before briefly.

<sup>4</sup> In reading this, then, you are able to understand my insight into the secret of Messiah,

<sup>5</sup> which was not made known to the sons of men in other generations, as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to His set-apart emissaries and prophets:

<sup>6</sup> The gentiles to be co-heirs, united in the same body, and partakers together in the promise in Messiah through the Good News,

<sup>7</sup> of which I became a servant according to the gift of the favour of Elohim given to me, according to the working of His power.

<sup>8</sup> To me, the very least of all the set-apart ones, this favour was given, to bring the Good News of the unsearchable riches of Messiah among the gentiles,

<sup>9</sup> and to make all see how this secret is administered, which for ages past has been hidden in Elohim who created all through יהושע Messiah,

<sup>10</sup> so that now, through the assembly, the many-sided wisdom of Elohim might be known to the principalities and authorities in the heavenlies,

<sup>11</sup> according to the everlasting purpose which He made in Messiah יהושע our Master,

<sup>12</sup> in whom we have boldness and access, with reliance, through belief in Him.

<sup>13</sup> I pray therefore, that you do not lose heart at my pressures on your behalf, which is your esteem.

<sup>14</sup> For this reason I bow my knees to the Father of our Master יהושע Messiah,

<sup>15</sup> from whom all fatherhood in the heavens and earth is named,

<sup>16</sup> in order that He might give you, according to the riches of His esteem by power, to be strengthened in the inner man, through His Spirit,

<sup>17</sup> that the Messiah might dwell in your hearts through belief – having become rooted and grounded in love,

<sup>18</sup> in order that you might be strengthened to firmly grasp, with all the set-apart ones, what is the width and length and depth and height,

<sup>19</sup> to know the love of Messiah which surpasses knowledge, in order that you might be filled to all the completeness of Elohim.

<sup>20</sup> And to Him who is able to do exceedingly above what we ask or think, according to the power that is working in us,

<sup>21</sup> to Him be esteem in the assembly by Messiah יהושע unto all generations, for ever and ever. Amĕn.
