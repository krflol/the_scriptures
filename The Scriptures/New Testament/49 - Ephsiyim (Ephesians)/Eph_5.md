<sup>1</sup> Become, then, imitators of Elohim as beloved children.
<sup>2</sup> And walk in love, as Messiah also has loved us, and gave Himself for us, a gift and an offering to Elohim for a sweet-smelling fragrance.
<sup>3</sup> But whoring and all uncleanness, or greed of gain, let it not even be named among you, as is proper among set-apart ones –
<sup>4</sup> neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor coarse jesting, which are not fitting, but rather thanksgiving.
<sup>5</sup> For this you know, that no one who whores, nor unclean one, nor one greedy of gain, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the reign of Messiah and Elohim.
<sup>6</sup> Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these the wrath of Elohim comes upon the sons of disobedience.
<sup>7</sup> Therefore do not become partakers with them.
<sup>8</sup> For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Master. Walk as children of light –
<sup>9</sup> for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness, and righteousness, and truth –
<sup>10</sup> proving what is well-pleasing to the Master.
<sup>11</sup> And have no fellowship with the fruitless works of darkness, but rather reprove them.
<sup>12</sup> For it is a shame even to speak of what is done by them in secret.
<sup>13</sup> But all matters being reproved are manifested by the light, for whatever is manifested is light.
<sup>14</sup> That is why He says, “Wake up, you who sleep, and arise from the dead, and Messiah shall shine on you.”
<sup>15</sup> See then that you walk exactly, not as unwise, but as wise,
<sup>16</sup> redeeming the time, because the days are wicked.
<sup>17</sup> So then do not be foolish, but understand what the desire of יהוה is.
<sup>18</sup> And do not be drunk with wine, in which is loose behaviour, but be filled with the Spirit,
<sup>19</sup> speaking to each other in psalms and songs of praise and spiritual songs, singing and striking the strings in your heart to the Master,
<sup>20</sup> giving thanks always for all to Elohim the Father, in the Name of our Master יהושע Messiah,
<sup>21</sup> subjecting yourselves to each other in the fear of Elohim.
<sup>22</sup> Wives, subject yourselves to your own husbands, as to the Master.
<sup>23</sup> Because the husband is head of the wife, as also the Messiah is head of the assembly, and He is Saviour of the body.
<sup>24</sup> But as the assembly is subject to Messiah, so also let the wives be to their own husbands in every respect.
<sup>25</sup> Husbands, love your wives, as Messiah also did love the assembly and gave Himself for it,
<sup>26</sup> in order to set it apart and cleanse it with the washing of water by the Word,
<sup>27</sup> in order to present it to Himself a splendid assembly, not having spot or wrinkle or any of this sort, but that it might be set-apart and blameless.
<sup>28</sup> In this way husbands ought to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.
<sup>29</sup> For no one ever hated his own flesh, but feeds and cherishes it, as also the Master does the assembly.
<sup>30</sup> Because we are members of His body, of His flesh and of His bones.
<sup>31</sup> “For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.”
<sup>32</sup> This secret is great, but I speak concerning Messiah and the assembly.
<sup>33</sup> However, you too, everyone, let each one love his own wife as himself, and let the wife see that she fears her husband.
