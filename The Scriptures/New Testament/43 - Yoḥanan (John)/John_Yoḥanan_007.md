<sup>1</sup> And after this יהושע was walking in Galil, for He did not wish to walk in Yehuḏah, because the Yehuḏim were seeking to kill Him.

<sup>2</sup> And the festival of the Yehuḏim was near, the Festival of Booths.

<sup>3</sup> So His brothers said to Him, ‘Get away from here and go into Yehuḏah, so that Your taught ones also see the works that You are doing.

<sup>4</sup> “For no one acts in secret while he himself seeks to be known openly. If You do these works, show Yourself to the world.”

<sup>5</sup> For even His brothers did not believe in Him.

<sup>6</sup> יהושע therefore said to them, “My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready.

<sup>7</sup> “It is impossible for the world to hate you, but it hates Me because I bear witness of it, that its works are wicked.

<sup>8</sup> “You go up to this festival. I am not yet going up to this festival, for My time has not yet been filled.”

<sup>9</sup> And having said this to them, He stayed in Galil.

<sup>10</sup> But when His brothers had gone up to the festival, then He also went up, not openly, but as it were in secret.

<sup>11</sup> The Yehuḏim, therefore, were seeking Him at the festival, and said, “Where is He?”

<sup>12</sup> And there was much grumbling about Him among the crowd. Some were saying, “He is good,” but others were saying, “No, but He is leading the crowd astray.”

<sup>13</sup> However, no one spoke openly of Him for fear of the Yehuḏim.

<sup>14</sup> And about the middle of the festival יהושע went up into the Set-apart Place, and He was teaching.

<sup>15</sup> And the Yehuḏim were marvelling, saying, “How does this Man know letters, not having learned?”

<sup>16</sup> יהושע answered them and said, “My teaching is not Mine, but His who sent Me.

<sup>17</sup> “If anyone desires to do His desire, he shall know concerning the teaching, whether it is from Elohim, or whether I speak from Myself.

<sup>18</sup> “He who speaks from himself is seeking his own esteem, but He who seeks the esteem of the One who sent Him is true, and no unrighteousness is in Him.

<sup>19</sup> “Did not Mosheh give you the Torah? Yet not one of you does the Torah! Why do you seek to kill Me?”

<sup>20</sup> The crowd answered and said, “You have a demon, who seeks to kill You?”

<sup>21</sup> יהושע answered and said to them, “I did one work, and you all marvel.

<sup>22</sup> “Because of this Mosheh has given you the circumcision – though it is not from Mosheh, but from the fathers – and you circumcise a man on the Sabbath.

<sup>23</sup> “If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath, so that the Torah of Mosheh should not be broken, are you wroth with Me because I made a man entirely well on the Sabbath?

<sup>24</sup> “Do not judge according to appearance, but judge with righteous judgment.”

<sup>25</sup> Therefore some of them from Yerushalayim said, “Is this not He whom they are seeking to kill?

<sup>26</sup> “And see! He speaks boldly, and they say none at all to Him. Could it be that the rulers truly know that this is truly the Messiah?

<sup>27</sup> “But we know where this One is from. And when the Messiah comes, no one knows where He is from.”

<sup>28</sup> יהושע therefore cried out in the Set-apart Place, teaching and saying, “You both know Me, and you know where I am from. And I have not come of Myself, but He who sent Me is true, whom you do not know.

<sup>29</sup> “But I know Him, because I am from Him, and He sent Me.”

<sup>30</sup> So they were seeking to seize Him, but no one laid a hand on Him, because His hour had not yet come.

<sup>31</sup> And many of the crowd believed in Him, and said, “When the Messiah comes, shall He do more signs than these which this One did?”

<sup>32</sup> The Pharisees heard the crowd muttering these matters concerning Him, and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to seize Him.

<sup>33</sup> Therefore יהושע said to them, “Yet a little while I am with you, then I go to Him who sent Me.

<sup>34</sup> “You shall seek Me and you shall not find Me, and where I am you are unable to come.”

<sup>35</sup> The Yehuḏim, therefore, said to themselves, “Where is He about to go that we shall not find Him? Is He about to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks, and to teach the Greeks?

<sup>36</sup> “What is this word which He said, ‘You shall seek Me and you shall not find Me, and where I am you are unable to come’?”

<sup>37</sup> And on the last day, the great day of the festival, יהושע stood and cried out, saying, “If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me, and let him who believes in Me drink.

<sup>38</sup> “As the Scripture said, out of His innermost shall flow rivers of living water.”

<sup>39</sup> And this He said concerning the Spirit, which those believing in Him were about to receive, for the Set-apart Spirit was not yet given, because יהושע was not yet esteemed.

<sup>40</sup> Many from the crowd, when they heard the word, then said, “This truly is the Prophet.”

<sup>41</sup> Others said, “This is the Messiah,” but others said, “Does the Messiah then come out of Galil?

<sup>42</sup> “Did not the Scripture say that the Messiah comes from the seed of Dawiḏ and from the village of Bĕyth Leḥem, where Dawiḏ was?”

<sup>43</sup> So a division came about among the people because of Him.

<sup>44</sup> And some of them wished to take Him, but no one laid hands on Him.

<sup>45</sup> The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees. And they said to them, “Why did you not bring Him?”

<sup>46</sup> The officers answered, “Never has any man spoken like this Man!”

<sup>47</sup> The Pharisees, therefore, answered them, “Have you also been led astray?

<sup>48</sup> “Has anyone of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed in Him?

<sup>49</sup> “But this crowd that does not know the Torah is accursed.”

<sup>50</sup> Naḵdimon – he who came to יהושע by night, being one of them – said to them,

<sup>51</sup> “Does our Torah judge the man unless it hears first from him and knows what he is doing?”

<sup>52</sup> They answered and said to him, “Are you also from Galil? Search and see that no prophet has arisen out of Galil.”

<sup>53</sup> And each one went to his own house.
