<sup>1</sup> After this יהושע manifested Himself again to the taught ones at the Sea of Kinnereth, and He manifested this way:

<sup>2</sup> Shim‛on Kĕpha, and T’oma called the Twin, and Nethanĕ’l of Qanah in Galil, the sons of Zaḇdai, and two others of His taught ones were together.

<sup>3</sup> Shim‛on Kĕpha said to them, “I am going to fish.” They said to him, “We are also coming with you.” They went out and immediately entered into the boat. And that night they caught none at all.

<sup>4</sup> But when it became early morning, יהושע stood on the beach. However, the taught ones did not know that it was יהושע.

<sup>5</sup> Then יהושע said to them, “Children, have you any food?” They answered Him, “No.”

<sup>6</sup> And He said to them, “Throw the net on the right side of the boat, and you shall find.” So they threw, and they were no longer able to draw it in because of the large number of fish.

<sup>7</sup> That taught one whom יהושע loved then said to Kĕpha, “It is the Master!” Then Shim‛on Kĕpha, hearing that it was the Master, put on his outer garment – for he was stripped – and plunged into the sea.

<sup>8</sup> And the other taught ones came in the little boat – for they were not far from land, but about two hundred cubits – dragging the net with fish.

<sup>9</sup> So when they had come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid on it, and bread.

<sup>10</sup> יהושע said to them, “Bring some of the fish which you have now caught.”

<sup>11</sup> Shim‛on Kĕpha went up and dragged the net to land, filled with one hundred and fifty-three big fishes. And though there were so many, the net was not broken.

<sup>12</sup> יהושע said to them, “Come, have breakfast.” And not one of the taught ones had the courage to ask Him, “Who are You?,” knowing that it was the Master.

<sup>13</sup> יהושע came and took the bread and gave it to them, and the same with the fish.

<sup>14</sup> This was now the third time יהושע was manifested to His taught ones after He was raised from the dead.

<sup>15</sup> When, therefore, they had eaten breakfast, יהושע said to Shim‛on Kĕpha, “Shim‛on, son of Yonah, do you love Me more than these?” He said to Him, “Yea, Master, You know that I love You.” He said to him, “Feed My lambs.”

<sup>16</sup> He said to him again, the second time, “Shim‛on, son of Yonah, do you love Me?” He said to Him, “Yea, Master, You know that I love You.” He said to him, “Shepherd My sheep.”

<sup>17</sup> He said to him the third time, “Shim‛on, son of Yonah, do you love Me?” Kĕpha was sad because He said to him the third time, “Do you love Me?” And he said to Him, “Master, You know all, You know that I love You.” יהושע said to him, “Feed My sheep.

<sup>18</sup> “Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were younger you girded yourself and walked where you wished, but when you are old you shall stretch out your hands, and another shall gird you and bring you where you do not wish.”

<sup>19</sup> Now this He said, signifying by what death he would esteem Elohim. And having said this, He said to him, “Follow Me.”

<sup>20</sup> And Kĕpha, turning around, saw the taught one whom יהושע loved following, who also had leaned on His breast at the supper, and said, “Master, who is the one who is delivering You up?”

<sup>21</sup> Seeing him, Kĕpha said to יהושע, “But Master, what about this one?”

<sup>22</sup> יהושע said to him, “If I wish him to remain till I come, what is that to you? You follow Me.”

<sup>23</sup> Therefore this word went out among the brothers that this taught one would not die. However, יהושע did not say to him that he would not die, but, “If I desire him to remain until I come, what is it to you?”

<sup>24</sup> This is the taught one who bears witness about these matters, and wrote these matters. And we know that his witness is true.

<sup>25</sup> Now there is much else that יהושע did. If every one of them were written down, I think that the world itself would not contain the written books. Amĕn.
