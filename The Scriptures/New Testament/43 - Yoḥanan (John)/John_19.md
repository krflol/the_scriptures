<sup>1</sup> Then, therefore, Pilate took יהושע and flogged Him.
<sup>2</sup> And the soldiers plaited a crown of thorns and placed it on His head, and they put a purple robe on Him,
<sup>3</sup> and came to Him and said, “Greetings, Sovereign of the Yehuḏim!” And they slapped Him in the face.
<sup>4</sup> And Pilate went outside again, and said to them, “See, I am bringing Him out to you, to let you know that I find no guilt in Him.”
<sup>5</sup> Then יהושע came outside, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. And Pilate said to them, “See the Man!”
<sup>6</sup> So when the chief priests and officers saw Him, they shouted, saying, “Impale! Impale!” Pilate said to them, “You take Him and impale Him, for I find no guilt in Him.”
<sup>7</sup> The Yehuḏim answered him, “We have a law, and according to our law He ought to die, for He has made Himself the Son of Elohim.”
<sup>8</sup> So when Pilate heard this word, he was more afraid,
<sup>9</sup> and went back into the palace, and asked יהושע, “Where are You from?” But יהושע gave him no answer.
<sup>10</sup> Then Pilate said to Him, “Do You not speak to me? Do You not know that I possess authority to impale You, and I possess authority to release You?”
<sup>11</sup> יהושע answered, “You would possess no authority against Me if it were not given you from above. Because of this, he who delivered Me to you has greater sin.”
<sup>12</sup> From then on Pilate was seeking to release Him, but the Yehuḏim shouted, saying, “If you release this One, you are not Caesar’s friend. Everyone who makes himself a sovereign, does speak against Caesar.”
<sup>13</sup> Therefore, when Pilate heard these words, he brought יהושע out and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called Pavement, but in Heḇrew, Gabbatha.
<sup>14</sup> And it was the Preparation Day of the Passover week, and about the sixth hour. And he said to the Yehuḏim, “See your Sovereign!”
<sup>15</sup> But they shouted, “Away, away, impale Him!” Pilate said to them, “Shall I impale your Sovereign?” The chief priests answered, “We have no sovereign except Caesar!”
<sup>16</sup> At that time, then, he delivered Him to them to be impaled. And they took יהושע and led Him away.
<sup>17</sup> And bearing His stake, He went out to the so-called Place of a Skull, which is called in Heḇrew, Golgotha,
<sup>18</sup> where they impaled Him, and two others with Him, one on this side and one on that side, and יהושע in the middle.
<sup>19</sup> And Pilate wrote a title too, and put it on the stake, and it was written: יהושע OF NATSARETH, THE SOVEREIGN OF THE YEHUḎIM.
<sup>20</sup> Many of the Yehuḏim therefore read this title, for the place where יהושע was impaled was near the city, and it was written in Heḇrew, in Greek, in Roman.
<sup>21</sup> So the chief priests of the Yehuḏim said to Pilate, “Do not write, ‘The Sovereign of the Yehuḏim,’ but, ‘He said, “I am the Sovereign of the Yehuḏim.” ’ ”
<sup>22</sup> Pilate answered, “What I have written, I have written.”
<sup>23</sup> Then the soldiers, when they had impaled יהושע, took His outer garments and made four parts, to each soldier a part, and the inner garment. But the inner garment was without seam, woven from the top in one piece.
<sup>24</sup> So they said to each other, “Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it – whose it shall be,” in order that the Scripture might be filled which says, “They divided My garments among them, and for My clothing they cast lots.” The soldiers therefore indeed did this.
<sup>25</sup> And by the stake of יהושע stood His mother, and His mother’s sister, Miryam the wife of Qlophah, and Miryam from Maḡdala.
<sup>26</sup> Then יהושע, seeing His mother and the taught one whom He loved standing by, He said to His mother, “Woman, see your son!”
<sup>27</sup> Then to the taught one He said, “See, your mother!” And from that hour that taught one took her to his own home.
<sup>28</sup> After this, יהושע, knowing that all had been accomplished, in order that the Scripture might be accomplished, said, “I thirst!”
<sup>29</sup> A bowl of sour wine stood there, and they filled a sponge with sour wine, put it on hyssop, and held it to His mouth.
<sup>30</sup> So when יהושע took the sour wine He said, “It has been accomplished!” And bowing His head, He gave up His spirit.
<sup>31</sup> Therefore, since it was the Preparation Day, that the bodies should not remain on the stake on the Sabbath – for that Sabbath was a high one – the Yehuḏim asked Pilate to have their legs broken, and that they be taken away.
<sup>32</sup> Therefore the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who was impaled with Him,
<sup>33</sup> but when they came to יהושע and saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs.
<sup>34</sup> But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and instantly blood and water came out.
<sup>35</sup> And he who has seen has witnessed, and his witness is true. And he knows that he is speaking the truth, in order that you might believe.
<sup>36</sup> For this took place in order for the Scripture to be filled: “Not one of His bones shall be broken.”
<sup>37</sup> And again another Scripture says, “They shall look on Him whom they pierced.”
<sup>38</sup> And after this, Yosĕph of Ramathayim, being a taught one of יהושע, but secretly, for fear of the Yehuḏim, asked Pilate that he might take the body of יהושע, and Pilate gave permission. Therefore he came and took the body of יהושע.
<sup>39</sup> And Naḵdimon, who at first came to יהושע by night, also came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds.
<sup>40</sup> Then they took the body of יהושע, and bound it in linen wrappings with the spices, as was the habit of the Yehuḏim for burial.
<sup>41</sup> And at the place where He was impaled there was a garden, and in the garden a fresh tomb in which no one had yet been laid.
<sup>42</sup> There, then, because of the Preparation Day of the Yehuḏim, they laid יהושע, because the tomb was near.
