<sup>1</sup> “I am the true vine, and My Father is the gardener.
<sup>2</sup> “Every branch in Me that bears no fruit He takes away. And every branch that bears fruit He prunes, so that it bears more fruit.
<sup>3</sup> “You are already clean because of the Word which I have spoken to you.
<sup>4</sup> “Stay in Me, and I stay in you. As the branch is unable to bear fruit of itself, unless it stays in the vine, so neither you, unless you stay in Me.
<sup>5</sup> “I am the vine, you are the branches. He who stays in Me, and I in him, he bears much fruit. Because without Me you are able to do naught!
<sup>6</sup> “If anyone does not stay in Me, he is thrown away as a branch and dries up. And they gather them and throw them into the fire, and they are burned.
<sup>7</sup> “If you stay in Me, and My Words stay in you, you shall ask whatever you wish, and it shall be done for you.
<sup>8</sup> “In this My Father is esteemed, that you bear much fruit, and you shall be My taught ones.
<sup>9</sup> “As the Father has loved Me, I have also loved you. Stay in My love.
<sup>10</sup> “If you guard My commands, you shall stay in My love, even as I have guarded My Father’s commands and stay in His love.
<sup>11</sup> “These words I have spoken to you, so that My joy might be in you, and that your joy might be complete.
<sup>12</sup> “This is My command, that you love one another, as I have loved you.
<sup>13</sup> “No one has greater love than this: that one should lay down his life for his friends.
<sup>14</sup> “You are My friends if you do whatever I command you.
<sup>15</sup> “No longer do I call you servants, for a servant does not know what his master is doing. But I have called you friends, for all teachings which I heard from My Father I have made known to you.
<sup>16</sup> “You did not choose Me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain, so that whatever you ask the Father in My Name He might give you.
<sup>17</sup> “These words I command you, so that you love one another.
<sup>18</sup> “If the world hates you, you know that it hated Me before it hated you.
<sup>19</sup> “If you were of the world, the world would love its own. But because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, for that reason the world hates you.
<sup>20</sup> “Remember the word that I said to you, ‘A servant is not greater than his master.’ If they persecuted Me, they shall persecute you too. If they have guarded My Word, they would guard yours too.
<sup>21</sup> “But all this they shall do to you because of My Name, because they do not know Him who sent Me.
<sup>22</sup> “If I had not come and spoken to them, they would have no sin, but now they have no excuse for their sin.
<sup>23</sup> “He who hates Me hates My Father as well.
<sup>24</sup> “If I did not do among them the works which no one else did, they would have no sin. But now they have both seen and have hated both Me and My Father,
<sup>25</sup> but...that the word might be filled which was written in their Torah, ‘They hated Me without a cause.’
<sup>26</sup> “And when the Helper comes, whom I shall send to you from the Father, the Spirit of the Truth, who comes from the Father, He shall bear witness of Me,
<sup>27</sup> but you also bear witness, because you have been with Me from the beginning.
