<sup>1</sup> And before the Festival of the Passover, יהושע knowing that His hour had come that He should move out of this world unto the Father, having loved His own who were in the world, He loved them to the end.
<sup>2</sup> And supper taking place, the devil having already put it into the heart of Yehuḏah from Qerioth, son of Shim‛on, to deliver Him up,
<sup>3</sup> יהושע, knowing that the Father had given all into His hands, and that He had come from Elohim and was going to Elohim,
<sup>4</sup> rose from supper and laid aside His garments, and having taken a towel, He girded Himself.
<sup>5</sup> After that He put water into a basin and began to wash the feet of the taught ones, and to wipe them with the towel with which He was girded.
<sup>6</sup> And so He came to Shim‛on Kĕpha, and he said to Him, “Master, do You wash my feet?”
<sup>7</sup> יהושע answered and said to him, “You do not know what I am doing now, but you shall know after this.”
<sup>8</sup> Kĕpha said to Him, “By no means shall You wash my feet, ever!” יהושע answered him, “If I do not wash you, you have no part with Me.”
<sup>9</sup> Shim‛on Kĕpha said to Him, “Master, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head!”
<sup>10</sup> יהושע said to him, “He who has had a bath does not need to wash, except his feet, but is clean altogether. And you are clean, but not all of you.”
<sup>11</sup> For He knew who would deliver Him up, so He said, “You are not all clean.”
<sup>12</sup> So when He had washed their feet and taken His garments, and sat down again, He said to them, “Do you know what I have done to you?
<sup>13</sup> “You call me Teacher and Master, and you say well, for I am.
<sup>14</sup> “Then if I, Master and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet.
<sup>15</sup> “For I gave you an example, that you should do as I have done to you.
<sup>16</sup> “Truly, truly, I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master, nor is an emissary greater than he who sent him.
<sup>17</sup> “If you know these teachings, blessed are you if you do them.
<sup>18</sup> “I do not speak concerning all of you. I know whom I have chosen, but that the Scripture might be filled, ‘He who eats bread with Me has lifted up his heel against Me.’
<sup>19</sup> “Now I say to you, before it takes place, that when it does take place, you shall believe that I am.
<sup>20</sup> “Truly, truly, I say to you, he who receives whomever I send, receives Me. And he who receives Me, receives Him who sent Me.”
<sup>21</sup> When יהושע had said this He was troubled in spirit, and witnessed and said, “Truly, truly, I say to you, one of you shall deliver Me up.”
<sup>22</sup> The taught ones looked at one another, doubting of whom He spoke.
<sup>23</sup> And one of His taught ones, whom יהושע loved, was reclining on the bosom of יהושע.
<sup>24</sup> Shim‛on Kĕpha then motioned to him to ask who it was of whom He spoke.
<sup>25</sup> And leaning back on the breast of יהושע he said to Him, “Master, who is it?”
<sup>26</sup> יהושע answered, “It is he to whom I shall give a piece of bread when I have dipped it.” And having dipped the bread, He gave it to Yehuḏah from Qerioth, son of Shim‛on.
<sup>27</sup> And after the piece of bread, Satan entered into him. יהושע, therefore, said to him, “What you do, do quickly.”
<sup>28</sup> But no one at the table knew why He said this to him,
<sup>29</sup> for some were supposing, because Yehuḏah had the bag, that יהושע was saying to him, “Buy what we need for the festival,” or that he should give somewhat to the poor.
<sup>30</sup> So, having received the piece of bread, he then went out straightaway, and it was night.
<sup>31</sup> When, therefore, he went out, יהושע said, “Now the Son of Aḏam has been esteemed, and Elohim has been esteemed in Him.
<sup>32</sup> “If Elohim has been esteemed in Him, Elohim shall also esteem Him in Himself, and straightaway esteem Him.
<sup>33</sup> “Little children, yet a little while I am with you. You shall seek Me, and as I said to the Yehuḏim, ‘Where I am going, you are unable to come,’ I now also say to you.
<sup>34</sup> “A renewed command I give to you, that you love one another, as I have loved you, that you also love one another.
<sup>35</sup> “By this shall all know that you are My taught ones, if you have love for one another.”
<sup>36</sup> Shim‛on Kĕpha said to Him, “Master, where are You going?” יהושע answered him, “Where I am going you are unable to follow Me now, but afterwards you shall follow Me.”
<sup>37</sup> Kĕpha said to Him, “Master, why am I unable to follow You now? I shall lay down my life for You.”
<sup>38</sup> יהושע answered him, “Shall you lay down your life for Me? Truly, truly, I say to you, the cock shall not crow at all until you have denied Me three times.
