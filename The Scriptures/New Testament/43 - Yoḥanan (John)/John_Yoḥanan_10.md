<sup>1</sup> “Truly, truly, I say to you, he who does not enter through the door into the sheepfold, but climbs up by another way, that one is a thief and a robber.

<sup>2</sup> “But he who enters through the door is the shepherd of the sheep.

<sup>3</sup> “The doorkeeper opens for him, and the sheep hear his voice. And he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.

<sup>4</sup> “And when he has brought out his own sheep, he goes before them. And the sheep follow him, because they know his voice.

<sup>5</sup> “And they shall by no means follow a stranger, but shall flee from him, because they do not know the voice of strangers.”

<sup>6</sup> יהושע used this figure of speech, but they did not know what He had been saying to them.

<sup>7</sup> יהושע therefore said to them again, “Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.

<sup>8</sup> “All who came before Me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not hear them.

<sup>9</sup> “I am the door. Whoever enters through Me, he shall be saved, and shall go in and shall go out and find pasture.

<sup>10</sup> “The thief does not come except to steal, and to slaughter, and to destroy. I have come that they might possess life, and that they might possess it beyond measure.

<sup>11</sup> “I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.

<sup>12</sup> “But the hireling, and not being a shepherd, one who does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees. And the wolf snatches the sheep and scatters them.

<sup>13</sup> “Now the hireling flees because he is a hireling and is not concerned about the sheep.

<sup>14</sup> “I am the good shepherd. And I know Mine, and Mine know Me,

<sup>15</sup> even as the Father knows Me, and I know the Father. And I lay down My life for the sheep.

<sup>16</sup> “And other sheep I have which are not of this fold – I have to bring them as well, and they shall hear My voice, and there shall be one flock, one shepherd.

<sup>17</sup> “Because of this the Father loves Me, because I lay down My life, in order to receive it again.

<sup>18</sup> “No one takes it from Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to receive it again. This command I have received from My Father.”

<sup>19</sup> Again there came a division among the Yehuḏim because of these words,

<sup>20</sup> and many of them said, “He has a demon and is mad, why do you listen to Him?”

<sup>21</sup> Others said, “These are not the words of one possessed by a demon. Is a demon able to open the eyes of the blind?”

<sup>22</sup> At that time the Ḥanukkah came to be in Yerushalayim, and it was winter.

<sup>23</sup> And יהושע was walking in the Set-apart Place, in the porch of Shelomoh.

<sup>24</sup> So the Yehuḏim surrounded Him and said to Him, “How long do You keep us in suspense? If You are the Messiah, say to us plainly.”

<sup>25</sup> יהושע answered them, “I have told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in My Father’s Name, they bear witness concerning Me.

<sup>26</sup> “But you do not believe, because you are not of My sheep, as I said to you.

<sup>27</sup> “My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me.

<sup>28</sup> “And I give them everlasting life, and they shall by no means ever perish, and no one shall snatch them out of My hand.

<sup>29</sup> “My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all. And no one is able to snatch them out of My Father’s hand.

<sup>30</sup> “I and My Father are one.”

<sup>31</sup> Again the Yehuḏim picked up stones to stone Him.

<sup>32</sup> יהושע answered them, “Many good works I have shown you from My Father. Because of which of these works do you stone Me?”

<sup>33</sup> The Yehuḏim answered Him, saying, “We do not stone You for a good work, but for blasphemy, and because You, being a Man, make Yourself Elohim.”

<sup>34</sup> יהושע answered them, “Is it not written in your own Torah, ‘I said, “You are elohim” ’?

<sup>35</sup> “If He called them elohim, to whom the word of Elohim came – and it is impossible for the Scripture to be broken –

<sup>36</sup> do you say of Him whom the Father set apart and sent into the world, ‘You are blaspheming,’ because I said, ‘I am the Son of Elohim’?

<sup>37</sup> “If I do not do the works of My Father, do not believe Me;

<sup>38</sup> but if I do, though you do not believe Me, believe the works, so that you know and believe that the Father is in Me, and I in Him.”

<sup>39</sup> Therefore they were seeking again to seize Him, but He went forth out of their hand,

<sup>40</sup> and went once more to the other side of the Yardĕn to the place where Yoḥanan was immersing at first, and there He stayed.

<sup>41</sup> And many came to Him and said, “Yoḥanan indeed did no sign, yet all that Yoḥanan said about this Man was true.”

<sup>42</sup> And many believed in Him there.

<sup>1</sup> “Truly, truly, I say to you, he who does not enter through the door into the sheepfold, but climbs up by another way, that one is a thief and a robber.
