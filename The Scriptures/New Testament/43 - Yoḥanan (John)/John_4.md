<sup>1</sup> So when the Master knew that the Pharisees had heard that יהושע made and immersed more taught ones than Yoḥanan –
<sup>2</sup> although יהושע Himself did not immerse, but His taught ones –
<sup>3</sup> He left Yehuḏah and went away again to Galil.
<sup>4</sup> And He had to pass through Shomeron.
<sup>5</sup> So He came to a city of Shomeron, called Sheḵem, near the piece of land Ya‛aqoḇ gave to his son Yosĕph.
<sup>6</sup> And Ya‛aqoḇ’s fountain was there. So יהושע, being wearied from the journey, was sitting thus at the fountain. It was about the sixth hour.
<sup>7</sup> A woman of Shomeron came to draw water. יהושע said to her, “Give Me to drink.”
<sup>8</sup> For His taught ones had gone off into the city to buy food.
<sup>9</sup> The woman of Shomeron therefore said to Him, “How is it that You, being a Yehuḏite, ask a drink from me, a woman of Shomeron?” For Yehuḏim do not associate with Shomeronites.
<sup>10</sup> יהושע answered and said to her, “If you knew the gift of Elohim, and who it is who says to you, ‘Give Me to drink,’ you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water.”
<sup>11</sup> The woman said to Him, “Master, You have no vessel, and the well is deep. From where, then, do You have living water?
<sup>12</sup> “Are You greater than our father Ya‛aqoḇ, who gave us the well, and drank from it himself, and his sons, and his cattle?”
<sup>13</sup> יהושע answered and said to her, “Everyone drinking of this water shall thirst again,
<sup>14</sup> but whoever drinks of the water I give him shall certainly never thirst. And the water that I give him shall become in him a fountain of water springing up into everlasting life.”
<sup>15</sup> The woman said to Him, “Master, give me this water, so that I do not thirst, nor come here to draw.”
<sup>16</sup> יהושע said to her, “Go, call your husband, and come here.”
<sup>17</sup> The woman answered and said, “I have no husband.” יהושע said to her, “You have well said, ‘I have no husband,’
<sup>18</sup> for you have had five husbands, and the one whom you now have is not your husband. What you have said is true.”
<sup>19</sup> The woman said to Him, “Master, I see that You are a prophet.
<sup>20</sup> “Our fathers worshipped on this mountain, but you people say that in Yerushalayim is the place where one needs to worship.”
<sup>21</sup> יהושע said to her, “Woman, believe Me, the hour is coming when you shall neither on this mountain, nor in Yerushalayim, worship the Father.
<sup>22</sup> “You worship what you do not know. We worship what we know, because the deliverance is of the Yehuḏim.
<sup>23</sup> “But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father also does seek such to worship Him.
<sup>24</sup> “Elohim is Spirit, and those who worship Him need to worship in spirit and truth.”
<sup>25</sup> The woman said to Him, “I know that Messiah is coming, the One who is called Anointed. When that One comes, He shall announce to us all.”
<sup>26</sup> יהושע said to her, “I who am speaking to you am He.”
<sup>27</sup> And upon this His taught ones came, and they were marvelling that He was speaking with a woman, however, no one said, “What do You seek?” or, “Why do You speak with her?”
<sup>28</sup> The woman then left her water-jug, and went away to the city, and said to the men,
<sup>29</sup> “Come, see a Man who told me all that I have done. Is this not the Messiah?”
<sup>30</sup> They went out of the city and were coming to Him.
<sup>31</sup> But in the meantime His taught ones were asking Him, saying, “Rabbi, eat.”
<sup>32</sup> And He said to them, “I have food to eat of which you do not know.”
<sup>33</sup> Then the taught ones said to each other, “Did anyone bring Him food to eat?”
<sup>34</sup> יהושע said to them, “My food is to do the desire of Him who sent Me, and to accomplish His work.
<sup>35</sup> “Do you not say, ‘There are still four months, and the harvest comes’? See, I say to you, lift up your eyes and see the fields, for they are white for harvest – already!
<sup>36</sup> “He who is reaping receives a reward, and gathers fruit for everlasting life, so that both he who is sowing and he who is reaping rejoice together.
<sup>37</sup> “For in this the word is true, ‘One sows and another reaps.’
<sup>38</sup> “I sent you to reap that for which you have not laboured. Others have laboured, and you have entered into their labours.”
<sup>39</sup> And many of the Shomeronites of that city believed in Him because of the word of the woman who witnessed, “He told me all that I have done.”
<sup>40</sup> Therefore when the Shomeronites came to Him, they were asking Him to stay with them, and He stayed there two days.
<sup>41</sup> And many more believed because of His word.
<sup>42</sup> And they said to the woman, “We no longer believe because of what you said, for we ourselves have heard, and we know that this is truly the Messiah, the Saviour of the world.”
<sup>43</sup> And after the two days He left there and went to Galil.
<sup>44</sup> For יהושע Himself witnessed that a prophet is without appreciation in his own country.
<sup>45</sup> Therefore when He came to Galil, the Galileans received Him, having seen all that He had done in Yerushalayim at the festival, for they also went to the festival.
<sup>46</sup> Then יהושע came again to Qanah of Galil where He had made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at Kephar Naḥum.
<sup>47</sup> When he heard that יהושע had come from Yehuḏah into Galil, he went to Him and was asking Him to come down and heal his son, for he was about to die.
<sup>48</sup> יהושע then said to him, “If you people do not see signs and wonders, you do not believe at all.”
<sup>49</sup> The nobleman said to Him, “Master, come down before my child dies!”
<sup>50</sup> יהושע said to him, “Go, your son lives.” And the man believed the word that יהושע spoke to him, and went.
<sup>51</sup> And while he was going down, his servants met him and reported, saying, “Your son lives!”
<sup>52</sup> He then asked from them the hour in which he became better, and they said to him, “Yesterday at the seventh hour the inflammation left him.”
<sup>53</sup> Then the father knew that it was at the same hour in which יהושע said to him, “Your son lives.” And he himself believed, and all his household.
<sup>54</sup> Again this was the second sign יהושע did, when He had come from Yehuḏah into Galil.
