<sup>1</sup> “These words I have spoken to you, so that you do not stumble.

<sup>2</sup> “They shall put you out of the congregations, but an hour is coming when everyone who kills you shall think he is rendering service to Elohim.

<sup>3</sup> “And this they shall do to you because they did not know the Father, nor Me.

<sup>4</sup> “But I have said these words to you, so that when the hour comes you remember that I told them to you. And these words I did not say to you at the beginning, for I was with you.

<sup>5</sup> “But now I go away to Him who sent Me, and not one of you asks Me, ‘Where are You going?’

<sup>6</sup> “But because I have said these words to you, grief has filled your heart.

<sup>7</sup> “But I say the truth to you. It is better for you that I go away, for if I do not go away, the Helper shall not come to you at all, but if I go, I shall send Him to you.

<sup>8</sup> “And having come, He shall reprove the world concerning sin, and concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment –

<sup>9</sup> concerning sin because they do not believe in Me,

<sup>10</sup> concerning righteousness because I go to My Father and you see Me no more,

<sup>11</sup> concerning judgment because the ruler of this world is judged.

<sup>12</sup> “I still have many words to say to you, but you are not able to bear them now.

<sup>13</sup> “But when He comes, the Spirit of the Truth, He shall guide you into all the truth. For He shall not speak from Himself, but whatever He hears He shall speak, and He shall announce to you what is to come.

<sup>14</sup> “He shall esteem Me, for He shall take of what is Mine and announce it to you.

<sup>15</sup> “All that the Father has is Mine. That is why I said that He takes from what is Mine and announces it to you.

<sup>16</sup> “A little while, and you do not see Me, and again a little while, and you shall see Me.”

<sup>17</sup> Therefore some of His taught ones said to one another, “What is this that He says to us, ‘A little while, and you do not see Me, and again a little while, and you shall see Me,’ and, ‘because I am going to the Father’?”

<sup>18</sup> So they said, “What is this that He says, ‘A little while’? We do not know what He is saying.”

<sup>19</sup> יהושע, therefore, knew that they were wishing to ask Him, and He said to them, “Are you asking one another about what I said, ‘A little while, and you do not see Me, and again a little while, and you shall see Me’?

<sup>20</sup> “Truly, truly, I say to you that you shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice. And you shall be grieved, but your grief shall become joy.

<sup>21</sup> “The woman has grief when she is in labour, because her hour has come, but as soon as she has given birth to the child, she no longer remembers the affliction, for joy that a man was born into the world.

<sup>22</sup> “And you, therefore, have grief now, but I shall see you again and your heart shall rejoice, and no one takes your joy away from you.

<sup>23</sup> “And in that day you shall ask Me none at all. Truly, truly, I say to you, whatever you ask the Father in My Name He shall give you.

<sup>24</sup> “Until now you have asked naught in My Name. Ask, and you shall receive, in order that your joy might be complete.

<sup>25</sup> “These words I have spoken to you in figures of speech, but an hour is coming when I shall no longer speak to you in figures of speech, but I shall declare the Father plainly to you.

<sup>26</sup> “In that day you shall ask in My Name, and I do not say to you that I shall pray the Father on your behalf,

<sup>27</sup> for the Father Himself does love you, because you have loved Me, and have believed that I came forth from Elohim.

<sup>28</sup> “I came forth from the Father and have come into the world. Again, I leave the world and go to the Father.”

<sup>29</sup> His taught ones said to Him, “See, now You are speaking plainly, and not using figure of speech!

<sup>30</sup> “Now we know that You know all, and have no need that anyone should question You. By this we believe that You came forth from Elohim.”

<sup>31</sup> יהושע answered them, “Do you now believe?

<sup>32</sup> “See, an hour is coming, and has now come, that you are scattered, each to his own, and leave Me alone. Yet I am not alone, because the Father is with Me.

<sup>33</sup> “These words I have spoken to you, that in Me you might have peace. In the world you have pressure, but take courage, I have overcome the world.”

<sup>1</sup> “These words I have spoken to you, so that you do not stumble.

<sup>2</sup> “They shall put you out of the congregations, but an hour is coming when everyone who kills you shall think he is rendering service to Elohim.
