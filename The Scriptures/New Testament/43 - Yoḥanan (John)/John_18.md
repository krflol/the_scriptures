<sup>1</sup> Having said these words, יהושע went out with His taught ones beyond the Qiḏron torrent, where there was a garden, into which He and His taught ones entered.
<sup>2</sup> And Yehuḏah, who delivered Him up, also knew the place, because יהושע often met there with His taught ones.
<sup>3</sup> Yehuḏah, then, having received the company of soldiers, and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, came there with lanterns, and torches, and weapons.
<sup>4</sup> יהושע, then, knowing all that would come upon Him, went forward and said to them, “Whom do you seek?”
<sup>5</sup> They answered Him, “ יהושע of Natsareth.” יהושע said to them, “I am.” And Yehuḏah, who delivered Him up, was also standing with them.
<sup>6</sup> When, therefore, He said to them, “I am,” they drew back and fell to the ground.
<sup>7</sup> Once more He asked them, “Whom do you seek?” And they said, “ יהושע of Natsareth.”
<sup>8</sup> יהושע answered, “I said to you that I am. If, then, you seek Me, allow these to go,”
<sup>9</sup> in order that the word might be filled which He spoke, “Of those whom You have given Me, I have lost none.”
<sup>10</sup> Then Shim‛on Kĕpha, having a sword, drew it and struck the high priest’s servant, and cut off his right ear. And the servant’s name was Meleḵ.
<sup>11</sup> Then יהושע said to Kĕpha, “Put your sword into the sheath. Shall I not drink the cup which My Father has given Me?”
<sup>12</sup> Then the company of soldiers and the commander and the officers of the Yehuḏim seized יהושע and bound Him,
<sup>13</sup> and they led Him away to Ḥanan first, for he was the father-in-law of Qayapha who was high priest that year.
<sup>14</sup> Now Qayapha was the one who gave counsel to the Yehuḏim that it was better that one man should die for the people.
<sup>15</sup> And Shim‛on Kĕpha followed יהושע, with another taught one, and that taught one was known to the high priest, and went with יהושע into the courtyard of the high priest.
<sup>16</sup> But Kĕpha was standing outside at the door. So the other taught one, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to her who kept the door, and brought Kĕpha in.
<sup>17</sup> Then the servant girl who kept the door said to Kĕpha, “Are you also one of this Man’s taught ones?” He said, “I am not.”
<sup>18</sup> And the servants and officers who had made a fire of coals stood there, because it was cold, and they warmed themselves. And Kĕpha was standing with them and warming himself.
<sup>19</sup> Then the high priest asked יהושע about His taught ones and His teaching.
<sup>20</sup> יהושע answered him, “I spoke openly to the world. I always taught in the congregation and in the Set-apart Place, where the Yehuḏim always meet, and I spoke no word in secret.
<sup>21</sup> “Why do you ask Me? Ask those who have heard Me what I said to them. See, they know what I said.”
<sup>22</sup> And when He had said this, one of the officers who stood by slapped יהושע in the face, saying, “Do You answer the high priest this way?”
<sup>23</sup> יהושע answered him, “If I have spoken evilly, bear witness of the evil, but if well, why do you strike Me?”
<sup>24</sup> Then Ḥanan sent Him bound to the high priest, Qayapha.
<sup>25</sup> And Shim‛on Kĕpha was standing and warming himself. Then they said to him, “Are you also one of His taught ones?” He denied it and said, “I am not!”
<sup>26</sup> One of the servants of the high priest, a relative of the one whose ear Kĕpha cut off, said, “Did I not see you in the garden with Him?”
<sup>27</sup> Then Kĕpha again denied it, and immediately a cock crowed.
<sup>28</sup> Then they led יהושע from Qayapha to the palace, and it was early. And they themselves did not go into the palace, lest they should be defiled, but that they might eat the Passover.
<sup>29</sup> Pilate, therefore, came out to them and said, “What accusation do you bring against this Man?”
<sup>30</sup> They answered and said to him, “If He were not an evil-doer, we would not have delivered Him up to you.”
<sup>31</sup> Then Pilate said to them, “You take Him and judge Him according to your law.” The Yehuḏim said to him, “It is not right for us to put anyone to death,”
<sup>32</sup> in order that the word of יהושע might be filled which He spoke, signifying by what death He was about to die.
<sup>33</sup> Then Pilate went back into the palace, and called יהושע, and said to Him, “Are You the Sovereign of the Yehuḏim?”
<sup>34</sup> יהושע answered him, “Do you say this from yourself, or did others talk to you about Me?”
<sup>35</sup> Pilate answered, “Am I a Yehuḏite? Your own nation and the chief priests have delivered You to me. What did You do?”
<sup>36</sup> יהושע answered, “My reign is not of this world. If My reign were of this world, My servants would fight, so that I should not be delivered to the Yehuḏim. But now My reign is not from here.”
<sup>37</sup> Then Pilate said to Him, “You are a sovereign, then?” יהושע answered, “You say it, because I am a sovereign. For this I was born, and for this I have come into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears My voice.”
<sup>38</sup> Pilate said to Him, “What is truth?” And when he had said this, he went out again to the Yehuḏim, and said to them, “I find no guilt in Him.
<sup>39</sup> “But you have a habit that I shall release someone to you at the Passover. Do you wish, then, that I release to you the Sovereign of the Yehuḏim?”
<sup>40</sup> Then they all shouted again, saying, “Not this One, but Barabba!” And Barabba was a robber.
