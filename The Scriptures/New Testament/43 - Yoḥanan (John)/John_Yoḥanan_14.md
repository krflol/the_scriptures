<sup>2</sup> “In My Father’s house are many staying places. And if not, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.

<sup>3</sup> “And if I go and prepare a place for you, I shall come again and receive you to Myself, that where I am, you might be too.

<sup>4</sup> “And where I go you know, and the way you know.”

<sup>5</sup> T’oma said to Him, “Master, we do not know where You are going, and how are we able to know the way?”

<sup>6</sup> יהושע said to him, “I am the Way, and the Truth, and the Life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.

<sup>7</sup> “If you had known Me, you would have known My Father too. From now on you know Him, and have seen.”

<sup>8</sup> Philip said to Him, “Master, show us the Father, and it is enough for us.”

<sup>9</sup> יהושע said to him, “Have I been with you so long, and you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father, and how do you say, ‘Show us the Father’?

<sup>10</sup> “Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me? The words that I speak to you I do not speak from Myself. But the Father who stays in Me does His works.

<sup>11</sup> “Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father in Me, otherwise believe Me because of the works themselves.

<sup>12</sup> “Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes in Me, the works that I do he shall do also. And greater works than these he shall do, because I go to My Father.

<sup>13</sup> “And whatever you ask in My Name, that I shall do, in order that the Father might be esteemed in the Son.

<sup>14</sup> “If you ask whatever in My Name, I shall do it.

<sup>15</sup> “If you love Me, you shall guard My commands.

<sup>16</sup> “And I shall ask the Father, and He shall give you another Helper, to stay with you forever –

<sup>17</sup> the Spirit of the Truth, whom the world is unable to receive, because it does not see Him or know Him. But you know Him, for He stays with you and shall be in you.

<sup>18</sup> “I shall not leave you orphans – I am coming to you.

<sup>19</sup> “Yet a little while, and the world no longer sees Me, but you shall see Me, because I live, and you shall live.

<sup>20</sup> “In that day you shall know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.

<sup>21</sup> “He who possesses My commands and guards them, it is he who loves Me. And he who loves Me shall be loved by My Father, and I shall love him and manifest Myself to him.”

<sup>22</sup> Yehuḏah – not the one from Qerioth – said to Him, “Master, what has come about that You are about to manifest Yourself to us, and not to the world?”

<sup>23</sup> יהושע answered him, “If anyone loves Me, he shall guard My Word. And My Father shall love him, and We shall come to him and make Our stay with him.

<sup>24</sup> “He who does not love Me does not guard My Words. And the Word which you hear is not Mine but of the Father Who sent Me.

<sup>25</sup> “These Words I have spoken to you while still with you.

<sup>26</sup> “But the Helper, the Set-apart Spirit, whom the Father shall send in My Name, He shall teach you all, and remind you of all that I said to you.

<sup>27</sup> “Peace I leave with you – My peace I give to you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.

<sup>28</sup> “You heard that I said to you, ‘I am going away and I am coming to you.’ If you did love Me, you would have rejoiced that I said, ‘I am going to the Father,’ for My Father is greater than I.

<sup>29</sup> “And now I have told you before it takes place, that when it does take place, you shall believe.

<sup>30</sup> “I shall no longer talk much with you, for the ruler of this world is coming, and he possesses none at all in Me,

<sup>31</sup> but, in order for the world to know that I love the Father, and that as the Father commanded Me, so I am doing. Rise up, let us go from here.
