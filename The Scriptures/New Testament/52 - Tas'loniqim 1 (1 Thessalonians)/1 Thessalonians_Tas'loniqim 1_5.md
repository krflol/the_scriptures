<sup>1</sup> Now, brothers, as to the times and the seasons, you do not need to be written to.

<sup>2</sup> For you yourselves know very well that the day of יהוה comes as a thief in the night.

<sup>3</sup> For when they say, “Peace and safety!” then suddenly destruction comes upon them, as labour pains upon a pregnant woman, and they shall not escape.

<sup>4</sup> But you, brothers, are not in darkness, so that this Day should overtake you as a thief.

<sup>5</sup> For you are all sons of light and sons of the day. We are not of the night nor of darkness.

<sup>6</sup> So, then, we should not sleep, as others do, but we should watch and be sober.

<sup>7</sup> For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk are drunk at night.

<sup>8</sup> But we who are of the day should be sober, putting on the breastplate of belief and love, and as a helmet the expectation of deliverance.

<sup>9</sup> Because Elohim did not appoint us to wrath, but to obtain deliverance through our Master יהושע Messiah,

<sup>10</sup> who died for us, so that we, whether awake or asleep, should live together with Him.

<sup>11</sup> Therefore encourage one another, and build up one another, as indeed you do.

<sup>12</sup> But brothers, we beg you to know those who labour among you, and are over you in the Master and admonish you,

<sup>13</sup> and to hold them in the highest regard in love because of their work. Be at peace among yourselves.

<sup>14</sup> And we appeal to you, brothers, warn those who are disorderly, encourage the faint-hearted, uphold the weak, be patient with all.

<sup>15</sup> See that no one renders evil for evil to anyone, but always pursue what is good both for yourselves and for all.

<sup>16</sup> Rejoice always,

<sup>17</sup> pray without ceasing,

<sup>18</sup> in all circumstances give thanks, for this is the desire of Elohim in Messiah יהושע for you.

<sup>19</sup> Do not quench the Spirit.

<sup>20</sup> Do not despise prophecies,

<sup>21</sup> prove them all. Hold fast what is good.

<sup>22</sup> Keep back from every form of wickedness.

<sup>23</sup> And the Elohim of peace Himself set you completely apart, and your entire spirit, and being, and body - be preserved blameless at the coming of our Master יהושע Messiah!

<sup>24</sup> He who calls you is trustworthy, who also shall do it.

<sup>25</sup> Brothers, pray for us.

<sup>26</sup> Greet all the brothers with a set-apart kiss.

<sup>27</sup> I charge you by the Master that this letter be read to all the set-apart brothers.

<sup>28</sup> The favour of our Master יהושע Messiah be with you. Amĕn.
