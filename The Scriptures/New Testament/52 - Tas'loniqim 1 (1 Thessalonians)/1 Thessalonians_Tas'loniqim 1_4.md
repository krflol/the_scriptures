<sup>1</sup> For the rest then, brothers, we beg you and call upon you in the Master יהושע, that as you received from us how you should walk and to please Elohim, you should excel still more,

<sup>2</sup> for you know what commands we gave you through the Master יהושע.

<sup>3</sup> For this is the desire of Elohim: your set-apartness! – that you should abstain from whoring,

<sup>4</sup> that each one of you should know how to possess his own vessel in set-apartness and respect,

<sup>5</sup> not in passion of lust, like the gentiles who do not know Elohim,

<sup>6</sup> not to overstep and take advantage of his brother in this matter, because the Master is the revenger of all such, as we indeed said to you before and earnestly warned.

<sup>7</sup> For Elohim did not call us to uncleanness, but in set-apartness.

<sup>8</sup> Therefore he who rejects this does not reject man, but Elohim, who also gives us His Set-apart Spirit.

<sup>9</sup> And it is not necessary to write to you about brotherly love, for you yourselves are taught by Elohim to love one another,

<sup>10</sup> for, in fact, you do so toward all the brothers who are in all Makedonia. But we call upon you, brothers, that you do so more and more,

<sup>11</sup> and to make it your ambition to live peaceably, and to attend to your own, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you,

<sup>12</sup> so that you behave decently toward those who are outside, and not be in any need.

<sup>13</sup> Now, brothers, we do not wish you to be ignorant concerning those who have fallen asleep, lest you be sad as others who have no expectation.

<sup>14</sup> For if we believe that יהושע died and rose again, so also Elohim shall bring with Him those who sleep in יהושע.

<sup>15</sup> For this we say to you by the word of the Master, that we, the living who are left over at the coming of the Master shall in no way go before those who are asleep.

<sup>16</sup> Because the Master Himself shall come down from heaven with a shout, with the voice of a chief messenger, and with the trumpet of Elohim, and the dead in Messiah shall rise first.

<sup>17</sup> Then we, the living who are left over, shall be caught away together with them in the clouds to meet the Master in the air – and so we shall always be with the Master.

<sup>18</sup> So, then, encourage one another with these words.

<sup>1</sup> For the rest then, brothers, we beg you and call upon you in the Master יהושע, that as you received from us how you should walk and to please Elohim, you should excel still more,

<sup>2</sup> for you know what commands we gave you through the Master יהושע.
