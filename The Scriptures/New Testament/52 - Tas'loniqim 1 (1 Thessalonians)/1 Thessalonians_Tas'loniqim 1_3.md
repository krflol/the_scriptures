<sup>1</sup> So, when we could no longer stand it, we thought it good to be left in Athens alone,

<sup>2</sup> and sent Timothy, our brother and servant of Elohim, and our fellow worker in the Good News of Messiah, to establish you and encourage you concerning your belief,

<sup>3</sup> that no one should be unsettled by these pressures, for you yourselves know that we are appointed to this.

<sup>4</sup> For indeed, we did inform you beforehand, when we were with, you that we would suffer pressure, and so it came to be, as you know.

<sup>5</sup> Because of this, when I could no longer stand it, I sent to find out about your belief, lest the trying one might have tried you, and our labour should be in vain.

<sup>6</sup> But now that Timothy has come to us from you, and having brought us good news of your belief and love, and that you always have good remembrance of us, longing to see us, as we also to see you,

<sup>7</sup> therefore, brothers, in all our pressure and distress we were encouraged concerning you by your belief.

<sup>8</sup> Because we now live, if you stand fast in the Master.

<sup>9</sup> For what thanks are we able to return to Elohim for you, for all the joy with which we rejoice for your sake in the presence of our Elohim,

<sup>10</sup> night and day praying exceedingly, to see your face and make complete what is lacking in your belief?

<sup>11</sup> And our Elohim and Father Himself, and our Master יהושע Messiah, direct our way to you!

<sup>12</sup> And the Master make you increase and overflow in love to each other and to all, as we also do to you,

<sup>13</sup> to establish your hearts blameless in set-apartness before our Elohim and Father at the coming of our Master יהושע Messiah with all His set-apart ones!
