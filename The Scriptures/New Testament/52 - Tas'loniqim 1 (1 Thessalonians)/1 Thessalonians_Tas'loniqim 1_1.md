<sup>1</sup> Sha’ul, and Sila, and Timothy, to the assembly of the Thessalonians in Elohim the Father and the Master יהושע Messiah: Favour to you and peace from Elohim our Father and the Master יהושע Messiah.

<sup>2</sup> We give thanks to Elohim always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers,

<sup>3</sup> remembering without ceasing your work of the belief, and the labour of love, and the endurance of the expectation in our Master יהושע Messiah in the presence of our Elohim and Father,

<sup>4</sup> knowing, brothers beloved by Elohim, that you were chosen.

<sup>5</sup> Because our Good News did not come to you in word only, but also in power, and in the Set-apart Spirit and in entire confirmation, as you know what kind of men we were among you for your sake.

<sup>6</sup> And you became imitators of us and of the Master, having received the word in much pressure, with joy of the Set-apart Spirit,

<sup>7</sup> so that you became an example to all who believe in Makedonia and Achaia.

<sup>8</sup> For from you the word of the Master has sounded forth, not only in Makedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your belief toward Elohim has gone out, so that it is unnecessary for us to say whatever.

<sup>9</sup> For they themselves report what kind of reception we had with you, and how you turned to Elohim from idols, to serve the living and true Elohim,

<sup>10</sup> and to wait for His Son from the heavens, whom He raised from the dead, יהושע, who is delivering us from the wrath to come.
