<sup>1</sup> You then, my son, be strong in the favour that is in Messiah יהושע.
<sup>2</sup> And what you have heard from me among many witnesses, entrust these to trustworthy men who shall be competent to teach others as well.
<sup>3</sup> Suffer hardship with us as a good soldier of יהושע Messiah.
<sup>4</sup> No one serving as a soldier gets involved in the affairs of this life, in order to please only him who enlisted him as a soldier.
<sup>5</sup> And if anyone competes in a game, he is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules.
<sup>6</sup> The hard-working farmer ought to be first to receive his share of the crops.
<sup>7</sup> Think over what I say, for the Master shall give you understanding into all this.
<sup>8</sup> Remember that יהושע Messiah, of the seed of Dawiḏ, was raised from the dead according to my Good News,
<sup>9</sup> for which I suffer hardship, as a criminal, unto chains, but the Word of Elohim is not chained.
<sup>10</sup> So I endure through it all for the sake of the chosen, so that they too obtain deliverance which is in Messiah יהושע with everlasting esteem.
<sup>11</sup> Trustworthy is the word: For if we died with Him, we shall also live with Him.
<sup>12</sup> If we endure, we shall also reign with Him. If we deny Him, He also shall deny us.
<sup>13</sup> If we are not trustworthy, He remains trustworthy, it is impossible for Him to deny Himself.
<sup>14</sup> Remind them of this, earnestly witnessing before the Master, not to wage verbal battles – which is useless – to the overthrowing of the hearers.
<sup>15</sup> Do your utmost to present yourself approved to Elohim, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, rightly handling the Word of Truth.
<sup>16</sup> But keep away from profane, empty babblings, for they go on to more wickedness,
<sup>17</sup> and their word shall eat its way like gangrene. Humenaios and Philetos are of this sort,
<sup>18</sup> who have missed the goal concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection has already taken place, and overthrow the belief of some.
<sup>19</sup> However, the solid foundation of Elohim stands firm, having this seal, “ יהוה knows those who are His,” Bem. 16:5 and, “Let everyone who names the Name of Messiah turn away from unrighteous-ness.”
<sup>20</sup> But in a large house there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay, some unto value and some unto no value.
<sup>21</sup> If, then, anyone cleanses himself from these matters, he shall be a vessel unto value, having been set apart, of good use to the Master, having been prepared for every good work.
<sup>22</sup> And flee from the lusts of youth, but pursue righteousness, belief, love, peace with those calling on the Master out of a clean heart.
<sup>23</sup> But refuse foolish and stupid questions, knowing that they breed quarrels.
<sup>24</sup> And a servant of the Master should not quarrel but be gentle towards all, able to teach, patient when wronged,
<sup>25</sup> in meekness instructing those who are in opposition, lest somehow Elohim gives them repentance unto a thorough knowledge of the truth,
<sup>26</sup> and they come to their senses, out of the snare of the devil, having been taken captive by him to do his desire.
