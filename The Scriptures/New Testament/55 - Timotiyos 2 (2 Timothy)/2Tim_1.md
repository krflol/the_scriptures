<sup>1</sup> Sha’ul, an emissary of יהושע Messiah by the desire of Elohim, according to the promise of life which is in Messiah יהושע,
<sup>2</sup> to Timothy, my beloved son: Favour, compassion, peace from Elohim the Father, and Messiah יהושע our Master.
<sup>3</sup> I thank Elohim, whom I serve with a clear conscience, as my forefathers did, as I unceasingly remember you in my prayers night and day,
<sup>4</sup> longing to see you, as I remember your tears, so that I might be filled with joy.
<sup>5</sup> For I recollect the sincere belief which is in you, which dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunike, and I am persuaded is in you too.
<sup>6</sup> For this reason I remind you to stir up the gift of Elohim which is in you through the laying on of my hands.
<sup>7</sup> For Elohim has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and of love and of self-control.
<sup>8</sup> So do not be ashamed of the witness of our Master, nor of me His prisoner, but suffer hardship with me for the Good News according to the power of Elohim,
<sup>9</sup> who has saved us and called us with a set-apart calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and favour which was given to us in Messiah יהושע before times of old,
<sup>10</sup> but now revealed by the appearing of our Saviour יהושע Messiah, who indeed abolished death and brought life and incorruptibility to light through the Good News,
<sup>11</sup> for which I was appointed a proclaimer, and an emissary, and a teacher of the gentiles.
<sup>12</sup> For this reason I also suffer these matters, but I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that He is able to watch over that which I have entrusted to Him until that Day.
<sup>13</sup> Hold the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me, in belief and love which are in Messiah יהושע.
<sup>14</sup> Watch over the good deposit that was entrusted to you, by the Set-apart Spirit dwelling in us.
<sup>15</sup> You know this, that all those in Asia have turned away from me, among whom are Phugellos and Hermogenes.
<sup>16</sup> The Master grant compassion unto the household of Onesiphoros, for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain,
<sup>17</sup> but when he was in Rome, he eagerly searched for me and found me.
<sup>18</sup> The Master grant to him to find compassion from the Master in that Day. And you know very well how many ways he attended to me at Ephesos.
