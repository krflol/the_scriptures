<sup>1</sup> In the sight of Elohim and the Master יהושע Messiah, who shall judge the living and the dead at His appearing and His reign, I earnestly charge you:
<sup>2</sup> Proclaim the Word! Be urgent in season, out of season. Reprove, warn, appeal, with all patience and teaching.
<sup>3</sup> For there shall be a time when they shall not bear sound teaching, but according to their own desires, they shall heap up for themselves teachers tickling the ear,
<sup>4</sup> and they shall indeed turn their ears away from the truth, and be turned aside to myths.
<sup>5</sup> But you be sober in all matters, suffer hardships, do the work of an evangelist, accomplish your service completely.
<sup>6</sup> For I am already being poured out, and the time of my departure has arrived.
<sup>7</sup> I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have guarded the belief.
<sup>8</sup> For the rest, there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Master, the righteous Judge, shall give to me on that Day, and not to me only but also to all those loving His appearing.
<sup>9</sup> Do your best to come to me soon,
<sup>10</sup> for Demas, having loved this present world, has deserted me and went to Thessalonike, Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.
<sup>11</sup> Luke alone is with me. Take Mark and bring him with you, for he is of good use to me for service.
<sup>12</sup> And Tuchikos I have sent to Ephesos.
<sup>13</sup> Bring the cloak that I left with Karpos at Troas when you come, and the books, especially the parchments.
<sup>14</sup> Alexander the coppersmith did many evils to me. The Master shall repay him according to his works.
<sup>15</sup> You, too, beware of him, for he strongly opposed our words.
<sup>16</sup> At my first defence no one stood with me, but all forsook me. Let it not be held against them.
<sup>17</sup> But the Master stood with me and did strengthen me, so that through me the preaching might be completely accomplished, and that all the gentiles should hear. And I was rescued out of the lion’s mouth.
<sup>18</sup> And the Master shall rescue me from every wicked work and save me for His heavenly reign. To Him be esteem forever and ever. Amĕn!
<sup>19</sup> Greet Prisca and Aqulas, and the house of Onesiphoros.
<sup>20</sup> Ĕrastos stayed in Corinth, but I left Trophimos sick in Miletos.
<sup>21</sup> Do your best to come before winter. Eubulos greets you, and Pudes, and Linos, and Klaudia, and all the brothers.
<sup>22</sup> The Master יהושע Messiah be with your spirit. Favour be with you. Amĕn.
