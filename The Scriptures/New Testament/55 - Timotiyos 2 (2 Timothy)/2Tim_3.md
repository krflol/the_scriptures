<sup>1</sup> But know this, that in the last days hard times shall come.
<sup>2</sup> For men shall be lovers of self, lovers of money, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, thankless, wrong-doers,
<sup>3</sup> unloving, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, haters of good,
<sup>4</sup> betrayers, reckless, puffed up, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of Elohim,
<sup>5</sup> having a form of reverence but denying its power. And turn away from these!
<sup>6</sup> For among them are those who creep into households and captivate silly women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts,
<sup>7</sup> always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.
<sup>8</sup> And as Yoḥane and Mamrĕ opposed Mosheh, so do these also oppose the truth – men of corrupt minds, found worthless concerning the belief;
<sup>9</sup> but they shall not go on further, for their folly shall be obvious to all, as also that of those men became.
<sup>10</sup> But you did closely follow my teaching, the way of life, the purpose, the belief, the patience, the love, the endurance,
<sup>11</sup> the persecutions, the sufferings, which came to me at Antioch, at Ikonion, and at Lustra – what persecutions I bore. Yet out of them all the Master delivered me.
<sup>12</sup> And indeed, all those wishing to live reverently in Messiah יהושע, shall be persecuted.
<sup>13</sup> But evil men and impostors shall go on to the worse, leading astray and being led astray.
<sup>14</sup> But you, stay in what you have learned and trusted, having known from whom you have learned,
<sup>15</sup> and that from a babe you have known the Set-apart Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for deliverance through belief in Messiah יהושע.
<sup>16</sup> All Scripture is breathed by Elohim and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for setting straight, for instruction in righteousness,
<sup>17</sup> that the man of Elohim might be fitted, equipped for every good work.
