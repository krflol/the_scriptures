<sup>1</sup> Sha’ul, an emissary – not from men, nor by a man, but by יהושע Messiah and Elohim the Father who raised Him from the dead –

<sup>2</sup> and all the brothers who are with me, to the assemblies of Galatia:

<sup>3</sup> Favour to you and peace from Elohim the Father and our Master יהושע Messiah,

<sup>4</sup> who gave Himself for our sins, to deliver us out of this present wicked age, according to the desire of our Elohim and Father,

<sup>5</sup> to whom be the praise forever and ever. Amĕn.

<sup>6</sup> I marvel that you are so readily turning away from Him who called you in the favour of Messiah, to a different ‘Good News,’

<sup>7</sup> which is not another, only there are some who are troubling you and wishing to pervert the Good News of Messiah.

<sup>8</sup> However, even if we, or a messenger out of heaven, bring a ‘Good News’ to you beside what we announced to you, let him be accursed.

<sup>9</sup> As we have said before, and now I say again, if anyone brings a ‘Good News’ to you beside what you have received, let him be accursed.

<sup>10</sup> For do I now persuade men, or Elohim? Or do I seek to please men? For if I still pleased men, I should not be a servant of Messiah.

<sup>11</sup> And I make known to you, brothers, that the Good News announced by me is not according to man.

<sup>12</sup> For I did not receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but through a revelation of יהושע Messiah.

<sup>13</sup> For you have heard of my former way of life in Yehuḏaism, how intensely I persecuted the assembly of Elohim, and ravaged it.

<sup>14</sup> And I progressed in Yehuḏaism beyond many of my age in my race, being more exceedingly ardent for the traditions of my fathers.

<sup>15</sup> But when it pleased Elohim, who separated me from my mother’s womb and called me by His favour,

<sup>16</sup> to reveal His Son in me, that I might bring Him, the Good News, to the gentiles, I did not immediately consult with flesh and blood,

<sup>17</sup> neither did I go up to Yerushalayim, to those who were emissaries before me. But I went to Araḇia, and returned again to Damascus.

<sup>18</sup> Then after three years I went up to Yerushalayim to learn from Kĕpha, and remained with him for fifteen days.

<sup>19</sup> And I saw no other of the emissaries except Ya‛aqoḇ, the brother of the Master.

<sup>20</sup> And what I write to you, see, before Elohim, I do not lie.

<sup>21</sup> Then I went into the districts of Syria and of Kilikia.

<sup>22</sup> And I was still not known by sight to the assemblies of Yehuḏah which were in Messiah,

<sup>23</sup> but they were hearing only that, “The one who once persecuted us now brings as Good News the belief which he once ravaged.”

<sup>24</sup> So they were esteeming Elohim in me.
