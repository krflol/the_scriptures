<sup>1</sup> In the freedom with which Messiah has made us free, stand firm, then, and do not again be held with a yoke of slavery.

<sup>2</sup> See, I, Sha’ul, say to you that if you become circumcised, Messiah shall be of no use to you.

<sup>3</sup> And I witness again to every man being circumcised that he is a debtor to do the entire Torah.

<sup>4</sup> You who are declared right by Torah have severed yourselves from Messiah, you have fallen from favour.

<sup>5</sup> For we, in Spirit, by belief, eagerly wait for the expectation of righteousness.

<sup>6</sup> For in Messiah יהושע neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any strength, but belief working through love.

<sup>7</sup> You were running well, who held you back from obeying the truth?

<sup>8</sup> That persuasion does not come from Him who calls you.

<sup>9</sup> A little leaven leavens all the lump.

<sup>10</sup> I trust in you, in the Master, that you shall have no other mind. And he who is troubling you shall bear his judgment, whoever he is.

<sup>11</sup> And I, brothers, if I still proclaim circumcision, why am I still persecuted? Then the stumbling-block of the stake has been set aside.

<sup>12</sup> O that those who disturb you would even cut themselves off!

<sup>13</sup> For you, brothers, have been called to freedom, only do not use freedom as an occasion for the flesh, but through love serve one another.

<sup>14</sup> For the entire Torah is completed in one word, in this, “You shall love your neighbour as yourself.”

<sup>15</sup> And if you bite and devour one another, beware lest you be consumed by one another!

<sup>16</sup> And I say: Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not accomplish the lust of the flesh.

<sup>17</sup> For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh. And these are opposed to each other, so that you do not do what you desire to do.

<sup>18</sup> But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under Torah.

<sup>19</sup> And the works of the flesh are well-known, which are these: adultery, whoring, uncleanness, indecency,

<sup>20</sup> idolatry, drug sorcery, hatred, quarrels, jealousies, fits of rage, selfish ambitions, dissensions, factions,

<sup>21</sup> envy, murders, drunkenness, wild parties, and the like – of which I forewarn you, even as I also said before, that those who practise such as these shall not inherit the reign of Elohim.

<sup>22</sup> But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, trustworthiness,

<sup>23</sup> gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no Torah.

<sup>24</sup> And those who are of Messiah have impaled the flesh with its passions and the desires.

<sup>25</sup> If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.

<sup>26</sup> Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another.
