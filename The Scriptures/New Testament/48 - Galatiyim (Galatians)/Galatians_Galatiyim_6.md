<sup>1</sup> Brothers, if a man is overtaken in some trespass, you the spiritual ones, set such a one straight in a spirit of meekness, looking at yourself lest you be tried too.

<sup>2</sup> Bear one another’s burdens, and so complete the Torah of Messiah.

<sup>3</sup> For if anyone thinks himself to be somebody, when he is not, he deceives himself.

<sup>4</sup> But let each one examine his own work, and then he shall have boasting in himself alone, and not in another.

<sup>5</sup> For each one shall bear his own burden.

<sup>6</sup> And let him who is instructed in the Word share in all that is good, with him who is instructing.

<sup>7</sup> Do not be led astray: Elohim is not mocked, for whatever a man sows, that he shall also reap.

<sup>8</sup> Because he who sows to his own flesh shall reap corruption from the flesh, but he who sows to the Spirit shall reap everlasting life from the Spirit.

<sup>9</sup> And let us not lose heart in doing good, for in due season we shall reap if we do not grow weary.

<sup>10</sup> So then, as we have occasion, let us do good to all, especially to those who are of the household of the belief.

<sup>11</sup> See with what big letters I have written to you with my own hand!

<sup>12</sup> As many as wish to make a good show in the flesh, these compel you to be circumcised, only so that they should not be persecuted for the stake of Messiah.

<sup>13</sup> For those who are circumcised do not even watch over the Torah, but they wish to have you circumcised so that they might boast in your flesh.

<sup>14</sup> And for me, let it not be that I should boast except in the stake of our Master יהושע Messiah, through whom the world has been impaled to me, and I to the world.

<sup>15</sup> For in Messiah יהושע neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any strength, but a renewed creature.

<sup>16</sup> And as many as walk according to this rule, peace and compassion be upon them, and upon the Yisra’ĕl of Elohim.

<sup>17</sup> From now on let no one trouble me, for I bear in my body the scars of the Master יהושע.

<sup>18</sup> The favour of our Master יהושע Messiah be with your spirit, brothers. Amĕn.
