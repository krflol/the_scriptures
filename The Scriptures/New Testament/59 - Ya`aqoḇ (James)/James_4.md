<sup>1</sup> Where do fightings and strivings come from among you? Do they not come from your pleasures that battle in your members?
<sup>2</sup> You desire, and do not have. You murder, and are jealous, and are unable to obtain. You strive and fight, and you do not possess, because you do not ask.
<sup>3</sup> You ask and do not receive, because you ask evilly, in order to spend it on your pleasures.
<sup>4</sup> Adulterers and adulteresses! Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with Elohim? Whoever therefore intends to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of Elohim.
<sup>5</sup> Or do you think that the Scripture speaks to no purpose? Does the Spirit which dwells in us intensely crave unto envy?
<sup>6</sup> But He gives greater favour. Because of this He says, “Elohim resists the proud, but gives favour to the humble.”
<sup>7</sup> So then subject yourselves to Elohim. Resist the devil and he shall flee from you.
<sup>8</sup> Draw near to Elohim and He shall draw near to you. Cleanse hands, sinners. And cleanse the hearts, you double-minded!
<sup>9</sup> Lament and mourn and weep! Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to dejection.
<sup>10</sup> Humble yourselves in the sight of the Master, and He shall lift you up.
<sup>11</sup> Brothers, do not speak against one another. He that speaks against a brother and judges his brother, speaks against Torah and judges Torah. And if you judge Torah, you are not a doer of Torah but a judge.
<sup>12</sup> There is one Lawgiver and Judge, who is able to save and to destroy. Who are you to judge another?
<sup>13</sup> Come now, you who say, “Today or tomorrow, let us go to such and such a city, spend a year there, and trade, and make a profit,”
<sup>14</sup> when you do not know of tomorrow. For what is your life? For it is a vapour that appears for a little, and then disappears –
<sup>15</sup> instead of your saying, “If the Master desires, we shall live and do this or that.”
<sup>16</sup> But now you boast in your proud speeches. All such boasting is wicked.
<sup>17</sup> To him, then, who knows to do good and does not do it, to him it is sin.
