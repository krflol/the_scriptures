<sup>1</sup> My brothers, do not hold the belief of our Master יהושע Messiah, the Master of esteem, with partiality.
<sup>2</sup> For if there should come into your meeting a man with gold rings, in a splendid robe, and there should also come in a poor one dressed in rags,
<sup>3</sup> and you pay attention to the one wearing the splendid robe and say to him, “You sit here in a good place,” and say to the poor one, “You stand there,” or, “Sit here by my feet,”
<sup>4</sup> have you not discriminated among yourselves, and become judges with wicked thoughts?
<sup>5</sup> Listen, my beloved brothers: Has Elohim not chosen the poor of this world, rich in belief and heirs of the reign which He promised to those who love Him?
<sup>6</sup> But you have shown disrespect towards the poor man. Do not the rich oppress you and drag you into the courts?
<sup>7</sup> Do they not blaspheme that good Name by which you are called?
<sup>8</sup> If you truly accomplish the sovereign law according to the Scripture, “You shall love your neighbour as yourself,” you do well,
<sup>9</sup> but if you show partiality, you commit sin, being found guilty by the Torah as transgressors.
<sup>10</sup> For whoever shall guard all the Torah, and yet stumble in one point, he is guilty of all.
<sup>11</sup> For He who said, “Do not commit adultery,” also said, “Do not murder.” Now if you do not commit adultery, but you do murder, you have become a transgressor of Torah.
<sup>12</sup> So speak and so do as those who are to be judged by a Torah of freedom.
<sup>13</sup> For the judgment is without compassion to the one who has shown no compassion. And compassion boasts over judgment.
<sup>14</sup> My brothers, what use is it for anyone to say he has belief but does not have works? This belief is unable to save him.
<sup>15</sup> And if a brother or sister is naked and in need of daily food,
<sup>16</sup> but one of you says to them, “Go in peace, be warmed and be filled,” but you do not give them the bodily needs, what use is it?
<sup>17</sup> So also belief, if it does not have works, is in itself dead.
<sup>18</sup> But someone might say, “You have belief, and I have works.” Show me your belief without your works, and I shall show you my belief by my works.
<sup>19</sup> You believe that Elohim is one. You do well. The demons also believe – and shudder!
<sup>20</sup> But do you wish to know, O foolish man, that the belief without the works is dead?
<sup>21</sup> Was not Aḇraham our father declared right by works when he offered Yitsḥaq his son on the altar?
<sup>22</sup> Do you see that the belief was working with his works, and by the works the belief was perfected?
<sup>23</sup> And the Scripture was filled which says, “Aḇraham believed Elohim, and it was reckoned to him for righteousness.” And he was called, “Elohim’s friend.”
<sup>24</sup> You see, then, that a man is declared right by works, and not by belief alone.
<sup>25</sup> In the same way, was not Raḥaḇ the whore also declared right by works when she received the messengers and sent them out another way?
<sup>26</sup> For as the body without the spirit is dead, so also the belief is dead without the works.
