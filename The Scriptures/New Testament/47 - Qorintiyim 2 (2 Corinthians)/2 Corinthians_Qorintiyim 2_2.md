<sup>1</sup> And I decided this within myself, not to come to you again in sadness.

<sup>2</sup> For if I make you sad, then who is he who makes me glad but the one who is made sad by me?

<sup>3</sup> And I wrote to you as I did, so that having come, I might not have sadness over those from whom I should have joy, trusting in you all that my joy is that of you all.

<sup>4</sup> For out of much pressure and distress of heart I wrote to you, with many tears, not that you should be sad, but that you might know the love which I so richly have for you.

<sup>5</sup> But if anyone has caused sadness, he has not made me sad, but in some degree you all – not to be too harsh.

<sup>6</sup> For such a one this punishment, by the many, is sufficient,

<sup>7</sup> so that, on the contrary, you should rather forgive and comfort, lest somehow such a one be swallowed up with too much sadness.

<sup>8</sup> So I appeal to you to confirm your love to him.

<sup>9</sup> Besides, I wrote for this purpose also, that I might know the proof of you, if you are obedient in all matters.

<sup>10</sup> And whom you forgive any matter, I do also. For indeed, if I have forgiven any matter, I have forgiven that one for your sakes in the sight of Messiah,

<sup>11</sup> lest Satan should take advantage of us, for we are not ignorant of his thoughts.

<sup>12</sup> And when I came to Troas for the Good News of Messiah, and a door was opened to me by the Master,

<sup>13</sup> I had no rest in my spirit, because I did not find Titus my brother. But taking my leave of them, I went on to Makedonia.

<sup>14</sup> But thanks be to Elohim who always leads us on, to overcome in Messiah, and manifests through us the fragrance of His knowledge in every place.

<sup>15</sup> Because we are to Elohim the fragrance of Messiah among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing.

<sup>16</sup> To the one we are the smell of death to death, and to the other the fragrance of life to life. And who is competent for these?

<sup>17</sup> For we are not, as so many, adulterating the Word of Elohim for gain – but as of sincerity, but as from Elohim, in the sight of Elohim, we speak in Messiah.
