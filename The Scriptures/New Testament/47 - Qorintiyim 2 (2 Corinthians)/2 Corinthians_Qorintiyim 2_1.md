<sup>1</sup> Sha’ul, an emissary of יהושע Messiah, by the desire of Elohim, and Timothy the brother, to the assembly of Elohim that is at Corinth, with all the set-apart ones who are in all Achaia:

<sup>2</sup> Favour to you and peace from Elohim our Father and the Master יהושע Messiah.

<sup>3</sup> Blessed be the Elohim and Father of our Master יהושע Messiah, the Father of compassion and Elohim of all comfort,

<sup>4</sup> who is comforting us in all our pressure, enabling us to comfort those who are in every pressure, through the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by Elohim.

<sup>5</sup> Because, as the sufferings of Messiah overflow in us, so our comfort also overflows through Messiah.

<sup>6</sup> And if we suffer pressure, it is for your comfort and deliverance, being worked out in enduring the same sufferings which we also suffer. If we are comforted, it is for your comfort and deliverance.

<sup>7</sup> And our expectation for you is steadfast, because we know that as you are sharing in the sufferings – so also in the comfort.

<sup>8</sup> For we do not wish you to be ignorant, brothers, of our pressure which came to us in Asia, that we were weighed down, exceedingly, beyond ability, so that we despaired even of life.

<sup>9</sup> Indeed, we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves but in Elohim who raises the dead,

<sup>10</sup> who rescued us from so great a death, and does rescue, in whom we trust that He shall still rescue us,

<sup>11</sup> you also helping together in prayer for us, that thanks shall be given by many on our behalf for the favour bestowed upon us through many.

<sup>12</sup> For our boasting is this: the witness of our conscience that we behaved ourselves in the world in simplicity and sincerity of Elohim, not in fleshly wisdom but in the favour of Elohim, and much more toward you.

<sup>13</sup> For we are not writing any other matters to you than what you read or understand. Now I trust you shall understand, even to the end,

<sup>14</sup> as also you have understood us in part, that we are your boast as you also are ours, in the day of the Master יהושע.

<sup>15</sup> And relying on this I intended to come to you before, that you might twice receive a favour,

<sup>16</sup> and to pass your way into Makedonia, and again from Makedonia come to you, and to be sent by you on my way to Yehuḏah.

<sup>17</sup> Since I intended this, did I do it lightly? Or what I plan, do I plan according to the flesh, that with me there should be Yea, Yea, and No, No?

<sup>18</sup> But Elohim is trustworthy, that our word to you was not Yea and No.

<sup>19</sup> For the Son of Elohim, יהושע Messiah, who was proclaimed among you by us – by me, Sila, and Timothy – was not Yea and No, but in Him was Yea.

<sup>20</sup> For as many promises as are of Elohim, in Him they are Yea, and in Him Amĕn, to the esteem of Elohim through us.

<sup>21</sup> But He who establishes us with you in Messiah and has anointed us is Elohim,

<sup>22</sup> who also sealed us, and gave the Spirit in our hearts as a pledge.

<sup>23</sup> And I call Elohim as witness against my being, that to spare you I came no more to Corinth.

<sup>24</sup> Not that we rule over your belief, but we are fellow workers for your joy, for you stand by belief.
