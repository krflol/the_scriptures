<sup>1</sup> And working together, we also call upon you not to receive the favour of Elohim in vain –

<sup>2</sup> For He says, “In an acceptable time I have heard you, and in a day of deliverance I have helped you.” See, now is the well-accepted time, see, now is a day of deliverance –

<sup>3</sup> giving no cause of stumbling in whatever, so that the service is not blamed.

<sup>4</sup> Rather, we commend ourselves as servants of Elohim in every way: in much endurance, in pressures, in hardships, in distresses,

<sup>5</sup> in stripes, in imprisonments, in disturbances, in toils, in watchings, in fastings,

<sup>6</sup> in cleanness, in knowledge, in patience, in kindness, in the Set-apart Spirit, in love unfeigned,

<sup>7</sup> in the word of truth, in the power of Elohim, through the weapons of righteousness, on the right and on the left,

<sup>8</sup> through esteem and disrespect, through evil report and good report; regarded as deceivers, and yet true;

<sup>9</sup> as unknown, and yet well-known; as dying, and see, we live; as disciplined, and yet not killed;

<sup>10</sup> as sad, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet enriching many; as having none, and yet possessing all.

<sup>11</sup> Our mouth has spoken openly to you, O Corinthians, our heart is wide open.

<sup>12</sup> You are not restrained by us, but you are restrained by your own affections.

<sup>13</sup> But for the same reward – I speak as to children – open wide your hearts too.

<sup>14</sup> Do not become unevenly yoked with unbelievers. For what partnership have righteousness and lawlessness? And what fellowship has light with darkness?

<sup>15</sup> And what agreement has Messiah with Beliya‛al? Or what part does a believer have with an unbeliever?

<sup>16</sup> And what union has the Dwelling Place of Elohim with idols? For you are a Dwelling Place of the living Elohim, as Elohim has said, “I shall dwell in them and walk among them, and I shall be their Elohim, and they shall be My people.”

<sup>17</sup> Therefore, “Come out from among them and be separate, says יהוה, and do not touch what is unclean, and I shall receive you.

<sup>18</sup> “And I shall be a Father to you, and you shall be sons and daughters to Me, says יהוה the Almighty.”
