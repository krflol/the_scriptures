<sup>1</sup> Are we to begin to recommend ourselves again? Or do we need, as some, letters of recommendation to you, or from you?
<sup>2</sup> You are our letter, having been written in our hearts, known and read by all men,
<sup>3</sup> making it obvious that you are a letter of Messiah, served by us, written not with ink but by the Spirit of the living Elohim, not on tablets of stone but on fleshly tablets of the heart.
<sup>4</sup> And such trust we have toward Elohim, through the Messiah.
<sup>5</sup> Not that we are competent in ourselves to reckon any matter as from ourselves, but our competence is from Elohim,
<sup>6</sup> who also made us competent as servants of a renewed covenant, not of the letter but of the Spirit, for the letter kills but the Spirit gives life.
<sup>7</sup> But if the administering of death in letters, engraved on stones, was esteemed, so that the children of Yisra’ĕl were unable to look steadily at the face of Mosheh because of the esteem of his face, which was passing away,
<sup>8</sup> how much more esteemed shall the administering of the Spirit not be?
<sup>9</sup> For if the administering of condemnation had esteem, the administering of righteousness exceeds much more in esteem.
<sup>10</sup> For indeed what was made esteemed had no esteem in this respect, in view of the esteem that excels.
<sup>11</sup> For if that which is passing away was esteemed, much more that which remains in esteem.
<sup>12</sup> Having then such expectation, we use much boldness of speech,
<sup>13</sup> and not like Mosheh, who put a veil over his face so that the children of Yisra’ĕl should not look steadily at the end of what was passing away.
<sup>14</sup> But their minds were hardened, for to this day, when the old covenant is being read, that same veil remains, not lifted, because in Messiah it is taken away.
<sup>15</sup> But to this day, when Mosheh is being read, a veil lies on their heart.
<sup>16</sup> And when one turns to the Master, the veil is taken away.
<sup>17</sup> Now יהוה is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of יהוה is, there is freedom.
<sup>18</sup> And we all, as with unveiled face we see as in a mirror the esteem of יהוה, are being transformed into the same likeness from esteem to esteem, as from יהוה, the Spirit.
