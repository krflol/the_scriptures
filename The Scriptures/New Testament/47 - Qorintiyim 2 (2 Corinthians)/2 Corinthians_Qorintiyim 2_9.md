<sup>1</sup> Indeed, concerning the service to the set-apart ones, it is unnecessary for me to write to you;

<sup>2</sup> for I know your eagerness, about which I boast of you to the Makedonians, that Achaia was ready a year ago. And your ardour has stirred up most of them.

<sup>3</sup> But I sent the brothers, lest our boasting on behalf of you should be made empty in this part, in order that, as I said, you were ready,

<sup>4</sup> lest if some Makedonians come with me and find you not ready, we – not to speak of you – should be put to shame because of our belief.

<sup>5</sup> So I thought it necessary to appeal to the brothers to come to you in advance, and arrange your promised blessing beforehand – this to be ready as a blessing and not as greediness.

<sup>6</sup> And this: He who sows sparingly shall also reap sparingly, and he who sows on blessing shall also reap on blessing.

<sup>7</sup> Let each one give as he purposes in his heart, not of grief or of necessity, for Elohim loves a joyous giver.

<sup>8</sup> And Elohim is able to make all favour overflow toward you, that you, always having all you need in every way, have plenty for every good work.

<sup>9</sup> As it has been written, “He scattered abroad, He gave to the poor, His righteousness remains forever.”

<sup>10</sup> And He who supplies seed to the sower, and bread for food, shall supply and increase the seed you have sown and increase the fruit of your righteousness,

<sup>11</sup> being enriched in every way for all simplicity, which works out thanksgiving to Elohim through us.

<sup>12</sup> Because the rendering of this service not only supplies the needs of the set-apart ones, but also is overflowing through many thanksgivings to Elohim.

<sup>13</sup> Through the proof of this service, they esteem Elohim on the submission of your confession to the Good News of Messiah, and generosity in sharing with them and all men,

<sup>14</sup> and by their prayer for you, who long for you because of the exceeding favour of Elohim in you.

<sup>15</sup> Thanks also to Elohim for His unspeakable gift!
