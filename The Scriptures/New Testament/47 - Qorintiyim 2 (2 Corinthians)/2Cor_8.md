<sup>1</sup> Now brothers, we make known to you the favour of Elohim which has been given in the assemblies of Makedonia:
<sup>2</sup> that in much trial of pressure the overflowing of their joy and their deep poverty overflowed into the riches of their generosity.
<sup>3</sup> Because I bear witness that according to their ability, and beyond their ability, they gave voluntarily,
<sup>4</sup> begging us with much urgency for the favour of taking part in this service to the set-apart ones.
<sup>5</sup> And, not as we had expected, they gave themselves first to the Master, and then to us by the desire of Elohim,
<sup>6</sup> that we should urge Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also complete this kind gift in you as well.
<sup>7</sup> But as you excel in every way – in belief, and speech, and knowledge, and all diligence, and in your love for us – that you should excel in this kind gift as well.
<sup>8</sup> I speak not by command, but I am proving the genuineness of your love by the eagerness of others.
<sup>9</sup> For you know the favour of our Master יהושע Messiah, that being rich, He became poor for your sake, so that you might become rich through His poverty.
<sup>10</sup> And in this I give an opinion: It is to your advantage not only to be doing what you began and were desiring to do a year ago,
<sup>11</sup> and now also complete the work, that as there was a readiness in desiring it, so there also should be a completion out of what you have.
<sup>12</sup> For if the readiness is present, it is well received according to what one has, not according to what he does not have –
<sup>13</sup> not, however, that others should be eased and you hard pressed,
<sup>14</sup> but by fair sharing, that now at this time your plenty for their need, so that their plenty might also be for your need – that there might be fair sharing.
<sup>15</sup> As it has been written, “He who gathered much did not have too much, and he who gathered little had not less.”
<sup>16</sup> But thanks be to Elohim who puts the same eagerness for you into the heart of Titus.
<sup>17</sup> Because he received the appeal, indeed, but being more eager, he went to you of his own accord.
<sup>18</sup> And we sent with him the brother whose praise is in the Good News through all the assemblies,
<sup>19</sup> and not only so, but who was also chosen by the assemblies to travel with us with this gift that is administered by us to the esteem of the Master Himself, and your ready mind,
<sup>20</sup> avoiding this: that anyone should blame us in this generous gift which is administered by us.
<sup>21</sup> For we provide what is right, not only in the sight of יהוה, but also in the sight of men.
<sup>22</sup> And we sent with them our brother whom we have often proved eager in many ways, but now much more eager, because of the great reliance which we have in you.
<sup>23</sup> As for Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker for you. As for our brothers, they are messengers of the assemblies, the esteem of Messiah.
<sup>24</sup> Therefore show to them the proof of your love and of our boasting on your behalf, and in the presence of the assemblies.
