<sup>1</sup> For we know that if the tent of our earthly house, is destroyed, we have a building from Elohim, a house not made with hands, everlasting in the heavens.

<sup>2</sup> For indeed in this we groan, longing to put on our dwelling which is from heaven,

<sup>3</sup> so that, having put it on, we shall not be found naked.

<sup>4</sup> For indeed, we who are in this tent groan, being burdened, not because we wish to put it off, but to put on the other, so that what is to die might be swallowed up by life.

<sup>5</sup> Now He who has prepared us for this same purpose is Elohim, who has given us the Spirit as a pledge of what is to come.

<sup>6</sup> Therefore, being always of good courage, and knowing that while we are at home in the body we are absent from the Master –

<sup>7</sup> for we walk by belief, not by sight –

<sup>8</sup> we are of good courage, and are well pleased rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the Master.

<sup>9</sup> So we also make it our aim to be well-pleasing to Him, whether being at home, or being away from home.

<sup>10</sup> For we all have to appear before the judgment seat of Messiah, in order for each one to receive according to what he has done in the body, whether good or evil.

<sup>11</sup> Knowing, therefore, the fear of יהוה, we persuade men, but we have been made manifest to Elohim, and I also trust in your consciences to have been manifested.

<sup>12</sup> For we do not again commend ourselves to you, but give you an occasion to boast on our behalf, in order that you have an answer for those who take pride in appearance and not in heart.

<sup>13</sup> For whether we are beside ourselves, it was for Elohim, or whether we are of sound mind, it is for you.

<sup>14</sup> For the love of Messiah compels us, having judged this: that if One died for all, then all died;

<sup>15</sup> and He died for all, that those who live should no longer live for themselves, but for Him who died for them, and was raised.

<sup>16</sup> So from now onwards we know no one according to the flesh. And if we have known Messiah according to the flesh, yet now we no longer know Him thus.

<sup>17</sup> Therefore, if anyone is in Messiah, he is a renewed creature – the old matters have passed away, see, all matters have become renewed!

<sup>18</sup> And all matters are from Elohim, who has restored us to favour with Himself through יהושע Messiah, and has given us the service of restoration to favour,

<sup>19</sup> that is, that Elohim was in Messiah restoring the world to favour unto Himself, not reckoning their trespasses to them, and has committed to us the word of restoration to favour.

<sup>20</sup> Therefore we are envoys on behalf of Messiah, as though Elohim were pleading through us. We beg, on behalf of Messiah: Be restored to favour with Elohim.

<sup>21</sup> For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, so that in Him we might become the righteousness of Elohim.

<sup>1</sup> For we know that if the tent of our earthly house, is destroyed, we have a building from Elohim, a house not made with hands, everlasting in the heavens.

<sup>2</sup> For indeed in this we groan, longing to put on our dwelling which is from heaven,
