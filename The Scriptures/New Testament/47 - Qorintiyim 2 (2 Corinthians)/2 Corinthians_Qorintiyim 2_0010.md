<sup>1</sup> And I, Sha’ul, myself appeal to you, through the meekness and gentleness of Messiah – I who am indeed lowly when face to face with you, but bold toward you when absent!

<sup>2</sup> But I pray, that when I am present, I might not be bold with that bravery by which I think to be bold against some who reckon us as if we walked according to the flesh.

<sup>3</sup> For though we walk in the flesh, we do not fight according to the flesh.

<sup>4</sup> For the weapons we fight with are not fleshly but mighty in Elohim for overthrowing strongholds,

<sup>5</sup> overthrowing reasonings and every high matter that exalts itself against the knowledge of Elohim, taking captive every thought to make it obedient to the Messiah,

<sup>6</sup> and being ready to punish all disobedience, when your obedience is complete.

<sup>7</sup> Take a look at what you are facing. If anyone seems to trust in himself that he is of Messiah, let him reckon again for himself, that as he is of Messiah, so also are we.

<sup>8</sup> For even if I should boast somewhat more about our authority, which the Master gave us for building up, and not for overthrowing you, I shall not be put to shame,

<sup>9</sup> lest I seem to frighten you away by letters.

<sup>10</sup> Because they say, “His letters are truly weighty and strong, but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech amounts to naught.”

<sup>11</sup> Let such a one take this into account, that what we are in word by letters when absent, such we are also in deed when we are present.

<sup>12</sup> For we do not presume to count ourselves or compare ourselves with those who commend themselves. But they, measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise.

<sup>13</sup> But we shall not boast beyond measure, but within the measure of the limits Elohim assigned unto us, to reach even to you.

<sup>14</sup> For we are not overextending ourselves, as if we did not reach to you, for we also came to you with the Good News of the Messiah,

<sup>15</sup> not boasting beyond measure in the labours of others, but having an expectation, that as your belief grows, we shall be greatly enlarged by you, according to our limits,

<sup>16</sup> to bring the Good News in the parts beyond you – not to boast in another’s limits in what has been accomplished.

<sup>17</sup> But “He who boasts, let him boast in יהוה.”

<sup>18</sup> For not he who commends himself is approved, but he whom the Master commends.
