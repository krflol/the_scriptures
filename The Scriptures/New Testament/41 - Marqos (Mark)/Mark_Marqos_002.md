<sup>1</sup> And some days later He again entered into Kephar Naḥum, and it was heard that He was in the house.

<sup>2</sup> And so many gathered together, that there was no more room, not even at the door. And He spoke the Word to them.

<sup>3</sup> And they came to Him, bringing a paralytic, carried by four.

<sup>4</sup> And not being able to come near Him because of the crowd, they uncovered the roof where He was. And when they had broken through, they let down the bed on which the paralytic was lying.

<sup>5</sup> And when יהושע saw their belief, He said to the paralytic, “Son, your sins are forgiven you.”

<sup>6</sup> Now some of the scribes were sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,

<sup>7</sup> “Why does this One talk like this? He is blaspheming! Who is able to forgive sins but Elohim alone?”

<sup>8</sup> And immediately יהושע, knowing in His spirit that they were reasoning that way within themselves, said to them, “Why do you reason about all this in your hearts?

<sup>9</sup> “Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Rise, take up your bed and walk’?

<sup>10</sup> “But in order for you to know that the Son of Aḏam possesses authority on earth to forgive sins...” He said to the paralytic,

<sup>11</sup> “I say to you, rise, take up your bed, and go to your house.”

<sup>12</sup> And he rose straightaway, and took up the bed, and went out before all, so that all were amazed and praised Elohim, saying, “We have never seen the like of it!”

<sup>13</sup> And He went out again by the sea, and all the crowd was coming to Him, and He taught them.

<sup>14</sup> And passing by, He saw Lĕwi the son of Alphai sitting at the tax office, and said to him, “Follow Me.” And having risen he followed Him.

<sup>15</sup> And it came to be, as He sat at the table at his house, that many tax collectors and sinners also sat with יהושע and His taught ones, for there were many, and they followed Him.

<sup>16</sup> And when the scribes and Pharisees saw Him eating with the tax collectors and sinners, they said to His taught ones, “Why does He eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?”

<sup>17</sup> And hearing this, יהושע said to them, “Those who are strong have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I did not come to call the righteous to repentance, but sinners.”

<sup>18</sup> And the taught ones of Yoḥanan and of the Pharisees were fasting. And they came and said to Him, “Why do the taught ones of Yoḥanan and of the Pharisees fast, but Your taught ones do not fast?”

<sup>19</sup> And יהושע said to them, “Are the friends of the bridegroom able to fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them they are not able to fast.

<sup>20</sup> “But the days shall come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then they shall fast in those days.

<sup>21</sup> “And no one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, otherwise the renewed piece pulls away from the old, and the tear is made worse.

<sup>22</sup> “And no one puts new wine into old wineskins, otherwise the new wine bursts the wineskins, and the wine runs out, and the wineskins are ruined. But new wine is to be put into fresh wineskins.”

<sup>23</sup> And it came to be that He went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. And as they went His taught ones began to pluck heads of grain,

<sup>24</sup> and the Pharisees said to Him, “Look, why do they do what is not right on the Sabbath?”

<sup>25</sup> And He said to them, “Have you never read what Dawiḏ did when he had need and was hungry, he and those with him?

<sup>26</sup> “How he went into the House of Elohim, while Eḇyathar was high priest, and ate the showbread, which is not right to eat, except for the priests, and he gave it also to those who were with him?”

<sup>27</sup> And He said to them, “The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath.

<sup>28</sup> “So the Son of Aḏam is also Master of the Sabbath.”
