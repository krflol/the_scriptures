<sup>1</sup> And rising up from there He came into the borders of Yehuḏah by the other side of the Yardĕn. And crowds gathered to Him again, and as He usually did, He was teaching them again.

<sup>2</sup> And Pharisees came and asked Him, “Is it right for a man to put away his wife?” – trying Him.

<sup>3</sup> And He answering, said to them, “What did Mosheh command you?”

<sup>4</sup> And they said, “Mosheh allowed a man to write a certificate of divorce, and to put her away.”

<sup>5</sup> And יהושע said to them, “Because of the hardness of your heart he wrote you this command.

<sup>6</sup> “However, from the beginning of the creation, Elohim ‘made them male and female.’

<sup>7</sup> ‘For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife,

<sup>8</sup> and the two shall become one flesh,’ so that they are no longer two, but one flesh.

<sup>9</sup> “Therefore what Elohim has joined together, let man not separate.”

<sup>10</sup> And in the house His taught ones asked Him about this again.

<sup>11</sup> And He said to them, “Whoever puts away his wife and marries another commits adultery against her.

<sup>12</sup> “And if a woman puts away her husband and marries another, she commits adultery.”

<sup>13</sup> And they were bringing little children for Him to touch them, but the taught ones were rebuking those who were bringing them.

<sup>14</sup> And when יהושע saw it, He was much displeased and said to them, “Let the little children come to Me, and do not forbid them, for of such is the reign of Elohim.

<sup>15</sup> “Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the reign of Elohim as a little child, shall certainly not enter into it.”

<sup>16</sup> And taking them up in His arms, laying His hands on them, He blessed them.

<sup>17</sup> And as He was setting out on the way, one came running, and knelt before Him, and asked Him, “Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit everlasting life?”

<sup>18</sup> And יהושע said to him, “Why do you call Me good? No one is good except One – Elohim.

<sup>19</sup> “You know the commands, ‘Do not commit adultery,’ ‘Do not murder,’ ‘Do not steal,’ ‘Do not bear false witness,’ ‘Do not rob,’ ‘Respect your father and your mother.’ ”

<sup>20</sup> And he answering, said to Him, “Teacher, all these I have watched over from my youth.”

<sup>21</sup> And יהושע, looking at him, loved him, and said to him, “One matter you lack: Go, sell all you possess and give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven. And come, follow Me, taking up the stake.”

<sup>22</sup> But he, being sad at this word, went away grieved, for he had many possessions.

<sup>23</sup> And יהושע, looking around, said to His taught ones, “How hard it is for those who have riches to enter into the reign of Elohim!”

<sup>24</sup> And the taught ones were astonished at His words. And יהושע responding, said to them again, “Children, how hard it is for those who trust in riches to enter into the reign of Elohim!

<sup>25</sup> “It is easier for a camel to enter through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the reign of Elohim.”

<sup>26</sup> And they were immeasurably astonished, saying among themselves, “Who then is able to be saved?”

<sup>27</sup> And looking at them, יהושע said, “With men it is impossible, but not with Elohim, for with Elohim all is possible.”

<sup>28</sup> And Kĕpha began to say to Him, “See, we have left all and we have followed You.”

<sup>29</sup> יהושע said, “Truly, I say to you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands, for the sake of Me and the Good News,

<sup>30</sup> who shall not receive a hundredfold now in this time, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands, with persecutions, and in the age to come, everlasting life.

<sup>31</sup> “But many who are first shall be last, and the last first.”

<sup>32</sup> And they were on the way, going up to Yerushalayim, and יהושע was going before them. And they were astonished, and those who followed were afraid. And again He took the twelve aside and began to say to them what was about to befall Him:

<sup>33</sup> “See, we are going up to Yerushalayim, and the Son of Aḏam shall be delivered to the chief priests and to the scribes, and they shall condemn Him to death and shall deliver Him to the gentiles,

<sup>34</sup> and they shall mock Him, and flog Him, and spit on Him, and kill Him. And the third day He shall rise again.”

<sup>35</sup> And Ya‛aqoḇ and Yoḥanan, the sons of Zaḇdai, came up to Him, saying, “Teacher, we wish that You would do for us whatever we ask.”

<sup>36</sup> And He said to them, “What do you wish Me to do for you?”

<sup>37</sup> And they said to Him, “Grant us to be seated in Your esteem, one on Your right hand and the other on Your left.”

<sup>38</sup> But יהושע said to them, “You do not know what you ask. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, and be immersed with the immersion that I am immersed with?”

<sup>39</sup> And they said to Him, “We are able.” And יהושע said to them, “You shall indeed drink the cup that I drink, and with the immersion I am immersed with you shall be immersed,

<sup>40</sup> but to sit on My right hand and on My left is not Mine to give, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared.”

<sup>41</sup> And when the ten heard it, they began to be sorely displeased with Ya‛aqoḇ and Yoḥanan.

<sup>42</sup> And יהושע, calling them near, said to them, “You know that those who think to rule the gentiles are masters over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them.

<sup>43</sup> “But it is not so among you, but whoever wishes to become great among you shall be your servant.

<sup>44</sup> “And whoever wishes to be first among you, shall be servant of all.

<sup>45</sup> “For even the Son of Aḏam did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many.”

<sup>46</sup> And they came to Yeriḥo. And as He was leaving Yeriḥo with His taught ones and a large crowd, blind Bartimai, the son of Timai, was sitting by the way begging.

<sup>47</sup> And when he heard that it was יהושע of Natsareth, he began to cry out and to say, “ יהושע, Son of Dawiḏ, have compassion on me!”

<sup>48</sup> And many were reprimanding him to be silent, but he cried out all the more, “Son of Dawiḏ, have compassion on me!”

<sup>49</sup> And יהושע stopped and said, “Call him.” And they called the blind man, saying to him, “Take courage, arise, He is calling you.”

<sup>50</sup> And he, throwing aside his garment, rose and came to יהושע.

<sup>51</sup> And יהושע responding, said to him, “What do you desire I do for you?” And the blind man said to Him, “Rabboni, that I receive my sight.”

<sup>52</sup> And יהושע said to him, “Go, your belief has healed you.” And immediately he saw again and followed יהושע on the way.
