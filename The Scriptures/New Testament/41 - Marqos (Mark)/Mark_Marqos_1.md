<sup>1</sup> The beginning of the Good News of יהושע Messiah, the Son of Elohim.

<sup>2</sup> As it has been written in the Prophets, “See, I send My messenger before Your face, who shall prepare Your way before You,

<sup>3</sup> a voice of one crying in the wilderness, ‘Prepare the way of יהוה, make His paths straight.’ ”

<sup>4</sup> Yoḥanan came immersing in the wilderness and proclaiming an immersion of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.

<sup>5</sup> And all the country of Yehuḏah, and those of Yerushalayim, went out to him and were all immersed by him in the Yardĕn River, confessing their sins.

<sup>6</sup> And Yoḥanan was clothed with camel’s hair and a leather girdle around his waist, and eating locusts and wild honey.

<sup>7</sup> And he proclaimed, saying, “After me comes One who is mightier than I, whose sandal strap I am not worthy to stoop down and loosen.

<sup>8</sup> “I indeed did immerse you in water, but He shall immerse you in the Set-apart Spirit.”

<sup>9</sup> And it came to be in those days that יהושע came from Natsareth of Galil, and was immersed by Yoḥanan in the Yardĕn.

<sup>10</sup> And immediately, coming up from the water, He saw the heavens being torn open and the Spirit coming down on Him like a dove.

<sup>11</sup> And a voice came out of the heavens, “You are My Son, the Beloved, in whom I did delight.”

<sup>12</sup> And immediately the Spirit drove Him into the wilderness.

<sup>13</sup> And He was there in the wilderness forty days, tried by Satan, and was with the wild beasts. And the messengers attended Him.

<sup>14</sup> And after Yoḥanan was delivered up, יהושע came to Galil, proclaiming the Good News of the reign of Elohim,

<sup>15</sup> and saying, “The time has been filled, and the reign of Elohim has come near. Repent, and believe in the Good News.”

<sup>16</sup> And walking by the Sea of Galil, He saw Shim‛on, and Andri his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishers.

<sup>17</sup> And יהושע said to them, “Come, follow Me, and I shall make you become fishers of men.”

<sup>18</sup> And immediately they left their nets and followed Him.

<sup>19</sup> And having gone on a little from there, He saw Ya‛aqoḇ the son of Zaḇdai, and Yoḥanan his brother, and they were in the boat mending their nets.

<sup>20</sup> And immediately He called them, and leaving their father Zaḇdai in the boat with the hired servants, they went after Him.

<sup>21</sup> And they went into Kephar Naḥum, and immediately on the Sabbath He went into the congregation and taught.

<sup>22</sup> And they were astonished at His teaching, for He was teaching them as possessing authority, and not as the scribes.

<sup>23</sup> And there was a man in their congregation with an unclean spirit, and he cried out,

<sup>24</sup> saying, “Ha! What have we to do with You, יהושע of Natsareth? Did You come to destroy us? I know who You are: the Set-apart One of Elohim!”

<sup>25</sup> And יהושע rebuked him, saying, “Be silenced, and come out of him!”

<sup>26</sup> And throwing him into convulsions, the unclean spirit called out with a loud voice, and came out of him.

<sup>27</sup> And they were all so amazed, as to reason among themselves, saying, “What is this, a fresh teaching? With authority He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey Him!”

<sup>28</sup> And news about Him immediately spread into all the country around Galil.

<sup>29</sup> And coming out of the congregation, they went straight to the house of Shim‛on and Andri, with Ya‛aqoḇ and Yoḥanan.

<sup>30</sup> And the mother-in-law of Shim‛on lay sick with inflammation, and immediately they spoke to Him about her.

<sup>31</sup> And having come, He took her by the hand and lifted her up, and immediately the inflammation left her, and she served them.

<sup>32</sup> And when evening came, when the sun had set, they brought to Him all who were sick and those who were demon-possessed.

<sup>33</sup> And the entire city had gathered at the door.

<sup>34</sup> And He healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons, and was not allowing the demons to speak, because they knew Him.

<sup>35</sup> And having risen very early in the morning, while still dark, He went out, and went away to a lonely place, and there He prayed.

<sup>36</sup> And Shim‛on and those who were with Him searched for Him,

<sup>37</sup> and when they found Him, they said to Him, “All are seeking You.”

<sup>38</sup> And He said to them, “Let us go into the neighbouring towns, so that I proclaim there also, because for this I have come forth.”

<sup>39</sup> And He was proclaiming in their congregations, in all Galil, and casting out demons.

<sup>40</sup> And a leper came to Him, calling upon Him, kneeling down to Him and saying to Him, “If You desire, You are able to make me clean.”

<sup>41</sup> And יהושע, moved with compassion, stretched out His hand and touched him, and said to him, “I desire it. Be cleansed.”

<sup>42</sup> And immediately the leprosy left him, and he was cleansed.

<sup>43</sup> And having strictly warned him, He immediately sent him away,

<sup>44</sup> and said to him, “See, say none at all to anyone, but go show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing what Mosheh ordered, as a witness to them.”

<sup>45</sup> But he went out and began to publish it so much, and to spread the word, that יהושע was no longer able to openly enter the city, but was outside in lonely places. Yet they came to Him from all directions.
