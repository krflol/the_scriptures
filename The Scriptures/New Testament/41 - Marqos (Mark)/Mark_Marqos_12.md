<sup>1</sup> And He began to speak to them in parables, “A man planted a vineyard and put a hedge around it, and dug a vat for the winepress and built a watchtower, and let it out to farmers and went away.

<sup>2</sup> “And at harvest time he sent a servant to the farmers, to receive some of the fruit of the vineyard from the farmers.

<sup>3</sup> “And they seized him and beat him and sent him away empty-handed.

<sup>4</sup> “And again he sent them another servant, and throwing stones at him, they wounded him in the head, and sent him away, having insulted him.

<sup>5</sup> “And again he sent another, and they killed him; and many others, beating some and killing some.

<sup>6</sup> “He had one more son, his beloved. He sent him last of all, saying, ‘They shall respect my son.’

<sup>7</sup> “But those farmers said among themselves, ‘This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours.’

<sup>8</sup> “So they took him and killed him and threw him out of the vineyard.

<sup>9</sup> “What then shall the owner of the vineyard do? He shall come and destroy the farmers, and give the vineyard to others.

<sup>10</sup> “Have you not read this Scripture, ‘The stone which the builders rejected has become the chief corner-stone.

<sup>11</sup> ‘This was from יהוה, and it is marvellous in our eyes’?”

<sup>12</sup> And they were seeking to seize Him, but feared the crowd, for they knew He had spoken the parable against them. And leaving Him, they went away.

<sup>13</sup> And they sent to Him some of the Pharisees and the Herodians, to catch Him in a word.

<sup>14</sup> And when they came, they said to Him, “Teacher, we know that You are true, and it does not concern You about anyone, for You are not partial to any, but teach the way of Elohim in truth. Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?

<sup>15</sup> “Should we pay, or should we not pay?” And He, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, “Why do you try Me? Bring Me a silver piece to look at.”

<sup>16</sup> And they brought it, and He said to them, “Whose likeness and inscription is this?” And they said to Him, “Caesar’s.”

<sup>17</sup> So יהושע said to them, “Give to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to Elohim what is Elohim’s.” And they marvelled at Him.

<sup>18</sup> And Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Him. And they asked Him, saying,

<sup>19</sup> “Teacher, Mosheh wrote to us that if a brother of anyone dies, and leaves his wife behind, and leaves no children, his brother should take his wife and raise up offspring for his brother.

<sup>20</sup> “There were seven brothers, and the first took a wife, and died, leaving no offspring.

<sup>21</sup> “And the second took her, and he died, leaving behind no offspring. And the third likewise.

<sup>22</sup> “And the seven left no offspring. Last of all the woman died too.

<sup>23</sup> “In the resurrection then, when they rise, whose wife shall she be? For seven had her as wife.”

<sup>24</sup> And יהושע answering, said to them, “Is this not why you go astray, because you do not know the Scriptures nor the power of Elohim?

<sup>25</sup> “For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are as messengers in the heavens.

<sup>26</sup> “And concerning the dead, that they rise – have you not read in the book of Mosheh, at the bush, how Elohim spoke to him, saying, ‘I am the Elohim of Aḇraham, and the Elohim of Yitsḥaq, and the Elohim of Ya‛aqoḇ’?

<sup>27</sup> “He is not the Elohim of the dead, but Elohim of the living. You, then, go greatly astray.”

<sup>28</sup> And one of the scribes coming near, hearing them reasoning together, knowing that He had answered them well, asked Him, “Which is the first command of all?”

<sup>29</sup> And יהושע answered him, “The first of all the commands is, ‘Hear, O Yisra’ĕl, יהוה our Elohim, יהוה is one.

<sup>30</sup> ‘And you shall love יהוה your Elohim with all your heart, and with all your being, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.’ This is the first command.

<sup>31</sup> “And the second, like it, is this, ‘You shall love your neighbour as yourself.’ There is no other command greater than these.”

<sup>32</sup> And the scribe said to Him, “Well said, Teacher. You have spoken the truth, for there is one Elohim, and there is no other besides Him.

<sup>33</sup> “And to love Him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the being, and with all the strength, and to love one’s neighbour as oneself, is more than all the burnt offerings and offerings.”

<sup>34</sup> And when יהושע saw that he answered wisely, He said to him, “You are not far from the reign of Elohim.” And after that no one was bold enough to question Him.

<sup>35</sup> And יהושע responding, said, while teaching in the Set-apart Place, “How is it that the scribes say that the Messiah is the Son of Dawiḏ?

<sup>36</sup> “Dawiḏ himself said by the Set-apart Spirit, ‘ יהוה said to my Master, “Sit at My right hand, until I make Your enemies a footstool of Your feet.” ’

<sup>37</sup> “Dawiḏ himself calls Him ‘Master.’ In what way then is He his Son?” And the large crowd heard Him gladly.

<sup>38</sup> And in His teaching He was saying to them, “Beware of the scribes, who like to walk around in long robes, and like greetings in the market-places,

<sup>39</sup> and the best seats in the congregations, and the best places at feasts,

<sup>40</sup> who are devouring widows’ houses, and for a show make long prayers. These shall receive greater judgment.”

<sup>41</sup> And sitting opposite the treasury He saw how the people put copper into the treasury. And many rich ones put in much.

<sup>42</sup> And a poor widow came and threw in two small copper coins, which amount to a cent.

<sup>43</sup> And calling near His taught ones He said to them, “Truly, I say to you that this poor widow has put in more than all those putting into the treasury,

<sup>44</sup> for they all put in out of their excess, but she out of her poverty put in all that she had, her entire livelihood.”
