<sup>1</sup> And immediately, in the morning, the chief priests had a council meeting with the elders and scribes and all the council. Having bound יהושע, they led Him away, and delivered Him to Pilate.

<sup>2</sup> And Pilate asked Him, “Are You the Sovereign of the Yehuḏim?” And He answering, said to him, “You say it.”

<sup>3</sup> And the chief priests accused Him of much, but He made no answer.

<sup>4</sup> And Pilate again asked Him, saying, “Have You no answer? See how much they witness against You!”

<sup>5</sup> But יהושע still gave no answer, so that Pilate marvelled.

<sup>6</sup> And at a festival he released to them one prisoner, whomever they were asking.

<sup>7</sup> And there was one called Barabba, chained with his fellow rebels, who had committed murder in the uprising.

<sup>8</sup> And the crowd, crying aloud, began to ask, as he had always done for them.

<sup>9</sup> But Pilate answered them, saying, “Do you wish me to release for you the Sovereign of the Yehuḏim?”

<sup>10</sup> For he knew that the chief priests had handed Him over because of envy.

<sup>11</sup> And the chief priests stirred up the crowd, that he should rather release Barabba to them.

<sup>12</sup> And Pilate answered and again said to them, “What then do you wish me to do to Him whom you call the Sovereign of the Yehuḏim?”

<sup>13</sup> And again they cried out, “Impale Him!”

<sup>14</sup> And Pilate said to them, “Why, what evil has He done?” And they vehemently cried out, “Impale Him!”

<sup>15</sup> And Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, released Barabba to them, and having whipped Him, he delivered יהושע over to be impaled.

<sup>16</sup> And the soldiers led Him away into the court, which is the palace, and they called together the entire company of soldiers,

<sup>17</sup> and decked Him with purple. And they plaited a crown of thorns, put it on Him,

<sup>18</sup> and they began to call out to Him, “Greetings, Sovereign of the Yehuḏim!”

<sup>19</sup> And they kept beating Him on the head with a reed and were spitting on Him. And bending the knee, they were bowing down to Him.

<sup>20</sup> And when they had mocked Him, they took the purple off Him, and put His own garments on Him, and led Him out to impale Him.

<sup>21</sup> And they compelled a passer-by, Shim‛on, a Cyrenian, coming from a field, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear His stake.

<sup>22</sup> And they brought Him to the place Golgotha, which is translated, Place of a Skull.

<sup>23</sup> And they were giving Him wine mixed with myrrh to drink, but He did not take it.

<sup>24</sup> And when they impaled Him, they divided His garments, casting lots for them, what each one should take.

<sup>25</sup> And it was the third hour, and they impaled Him.

<sup>26</sup> And the inscription of His accusation was written above: THE SOVEREIGN OF THE YEHUḎIM.

<sup>27</sup> And with Him they impaled two robbers, one on His right and the other on His left.

<sup>28</sup> And the Scripture was filled which says, “And He was reckoned with the lawless.”

<sup>29</sup> And those passing by were blaspheming Him, shaking their heads and saying, “Ah! You who destroy the Dwelling Place and build it in three days,

<sup>30</sup> save Yourself, and come down from the stake!”

<sup>31</sup> And likewise the chief priests and the scribes, mocking to one another said, “He saved others, He is unable to save Himself.

<sup>32</sup> “The Messiah? The Sovereign of Yisra’ĕl? Come down now from the stake, so that we see and believe.” And those who were impaled with Him were reproaching Him.

<sup>33</sup> And when the sixth hour came, darkness came over all the land until the ninth hour.

<sup>34</sup> And at the ninth hour יהושע cried out with a loud voice, saying, “Ĕli, Ĕli, lamah sheḇaqtani?” which is translated, “My Ĕl, My Ĕl, why have You forsaken Me?”

<sup>35</sup> And some of those standing by, when they heard it, said, “See, He is calling for Ĕliyahu!”

<sup>36</sup> And someone ran and filled a sponge with sour wine, and put it on a reed, and offered it to Him to drink, saying, “Leave Him, let us see if Ĕliyahu does come to take Him down.”

<sup>37</sup> And יהושע cried out with a loud voice, and breathed His last.

<sup>38</sup> And the veil of the Dwelling Place was torn in two from top to bottom.

<sup>39</sup> And when the captain, who was standing opposite Him, saw that He cried out like this and breathed His last, he said, “Truly this Man was the Son of Elohim!”

<sup>40</sup> And there were also women watching from a distance, among whom was also Miryam from Maḡdala, and Miryam the mother of Ya‛aqoḇ the Less and of Yosĕph, and Shelomah,

<sup>41</sup> who also followed Him and attended Him when He was in Galil, and many other women who came up with Him to Yerushalayim.

<sup>42</sup> And when evening had come, because it was the Preparation Day, that is, the day before the Sabbath,

<sup>43</sup> Yosĕph of Ramathayim, a prominent council member, who was himself waiting for the reign of Elohim, came, boldly went in to Pilate and asked for the body of יהושע.

<sup>44</sup> But Pilate wondered whether He was already dead, so summoning the captain, he asked him if He was already dead.

<sup>45</sup> And when he learned this from the captain, he gave the body to Yosĕph.

<sup>46</sup> And he, having bought fine linen, took Him down, and wrapped Him in the linen. And he laid Him in a tomb which had been hewn out of the rock, and rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb.

<sup>47</sup> And Miryam from Maḡdala, and Miryam the mother of Yosĕph, saw where He was laid.
