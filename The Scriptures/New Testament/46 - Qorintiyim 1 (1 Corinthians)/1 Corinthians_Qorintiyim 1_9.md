<sup>1</sup> Am I not an emissary? Am I not free? Have I not seen יהושע Messiah our Master? Are you not my work in the Master?

<sup>2</sup> If to others I am not an emissary, I certainly am to you. For you are the seal of my office of the emissary in the Master.

<sup>3</sup> My defence to those who examine me is this:

<sup>4</sup> Do we not have a right to eat and drink?

<sup>5</sup> Do we not have a right to take along a sister – a wife – as do also the other emissaries, and the brothers of the Master, and Kĕpha?

<sup>6</sup> Or do only Barnaḇah and I have no right to refrain from working?

<sup>7</sup> Who serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat of its fruit? Or who shepherds a flock and does not feed on the milk of the flock?

<sup>8</sup> Do I say this as a man? Or does not the Torah say the same too?

<sup>9</sup> For it has been written in the Torah of Mosheh, “You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the grain.” Is it about oxen Elohim is concerned?

<sup>10</sup> Or does He say it because of us all? For this was written because of us, that he who ploughs should plough in expectation, and the thresher in expectation of sharing.

<sup>11</sup> If we have sown spiritual seed among you, is it too much if we reap material goods from you?

<sup>12</sup> If others share authority over you, should not rather we? But we have not used this authority, but we put up with all, lest we hinder the Good News of Messiah.

<sup>13</sup> Do you not know that those serving the Set-apart Place eat from the Set-apart Place, and those attending at the altar have their share of the offerings of the altar?

<sup>14</sup> So also the Master instituted that those announcing the Good News should live from the Good News.

<sup>15</sup> But I have used none of these, nor have I written this that it should be done so to me. For it would be better for me to die than that anyone should make my boasting empty.

<sup>16</sup> For if I bring the Good News, it is no boasting for me, for necessity is laid on me, and it is woe to me if I do not bring the Good News!

<sup>17</sup> For if I do this voluntarily I have a reward, but if not voluntarily, I am entrusted with a management.

<sup>18</sup> What then is my reward? That in bringing the Good News, I should offer the Good News of Messiah without cost, so as not to abuse my authority in the Good News.

<sup>19</sup> For though I am free from all, I made myself a servant to all, in order to win more,

<sup>20</sup> and to the Yehuḏim I became as a Yehuḏite, that I might win Yehuḏim; to those who are under Torah, as under Torah, so as to win those who are under Torah;

<sup>21</sup> to those without Torah, as without Torah – not being without Torah toward Elohim, but under Torah of Messiah – so as to win those who are without Torah.

<sup>22</sup> To the weak I became as weak, so as to win the weak. To all men I have become all, so as to save some, by all means.

<sup>23</sup> And I do this because of the Good News, so as to become a fellow-partaker with it.

<sup>24</sup> Do you not know that those who run in a race indeed all run, but one receives the prize? Run in such a way as to obtain it.

<sup>25</sup> And everyone who competes controls himself in every way. Now they do it to receive a corruptible crown, but we for an incorruptible crown.

<sup>26</sup> Therefore I run accordingly, not with uncertainty. Thus I fight, not as one who beats the air.

<sup>27</sup> But I treat my body severely and make it my slave, so that when I have proclaimed to others, I myself might be rejected.
