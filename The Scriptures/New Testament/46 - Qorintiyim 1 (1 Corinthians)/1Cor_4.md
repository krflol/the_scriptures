<sup>1</sup> Let a man regard us as servants of Messiah and trustees of the secrets of Elohim.
<sup>2</sup> For the rest, it is sought in trustees, that those should be found trustworthy.
<sup>3</sup> But with me it is a small matter that I should be judged by you or by a man’s court. But not even myself I judge.
<sup>4</sup> For I am not conscious of any matter against myself, yet I am not declared right by this, but He who judges me is יהוה.
<sup>5</sup> So do not judge any at all before the time, until the Master comes, who shall bring to light what is hidden in darkness and reveal the thoughts of the hearts. And then each one’s praise shall come from Elohim.
<sup>6</sup> And these matters, brothers, I have applied in a figure to myself and Apollos for your sakes, so that in us you might learn not to think beyond what is written, so that none of you be puffed up on behalf of one against the other.
<sup>7</sup> For who makes you to differ? And what do you have that you did not receive? And if you did indeed receive it, why do you boast as if you had not received it?
<sup>8</sup> You are already satisfied! You are already enriched! You have reigned as sovereigns, apart from us! And I wish, indeed, you did reign, that we also might reign with you!
<sup>9</sup> For I think that Elohim has exhibited us, the emissaries, last, as appointed to death, because we became a spectacle to the world, both to messengers and to men.
<sup>10</sup> We are fools for the sake of Messiah, but you are wise in Messiah! We are weak, but you are strong! You are in esteem, but we are not appreciated!
<sup>11</sup> Until the present hour we both hunger and thirst, and we are scantily clad, and beaten, and homeless,
<sup>12</sup> and labour, working with our own hands. Being cursed, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer;
<sup>13</sup> being insulted, we help. We have been made as the filth of the world – dirt wiped off by all until now.
<sup>14</sup> I do not write this to shame you, but to warn you as my beloved children.
<sup>15</sup> For if you should have ten thousand instructors in Messiah, yet not many fathers, for in Messiah יהושע I have brought you forth through the Good News.
<sup>16</sup> Therefore I appeal to you, to become imitators of me.
<sup>17</sup> For this reason I have sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved and trustworthy son in the Master, who shall remind you of my ways in Messiah, as I teach everywhere in every assembly.
<sup>18</sup> Now some are puffed up, as though I were not coming to you.
<sup>19</sup> But I shall come to you shortly, if the Master desires, and I shall know, not the word of those who are puffed up, but the power.
<sup>20</sup> For the reign of Elohim is not in speech, but in power.
<sup>21</sup> What do you wish? Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of meekness?
