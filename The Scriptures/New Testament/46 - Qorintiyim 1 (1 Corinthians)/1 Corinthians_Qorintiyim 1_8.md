<sup>1</sup> And concerning food offered to idols: We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.

<sup>2</sup> If anyone thinks that he knows somewhat, he does not yet know as he should know.

<sup>3</sup> But if anyone loves Elohim, this one is known by Him.

<sup>4</sup> So then, concerning the eating of food offered to idols, we know that an idol is no matter at all in the world, and that there is no other Elohim but one.

<sup>5</sup> For even if there are so-called mighty ones, whether in heaven or on earth – as there are many mighty ones and many masters –

<sup>6</sup> for us there is one Elohim, the Father, from whom all came and for whom we live, and one Master יהושע Messiah, through whom all came and through whom we live.

<sup>7</sup> However, not all have this knowledge. But some, being aware of the idol, until now eat it as having been offered to an idol, so their conscience, being weak, is defiled.

<sup>8</sup> But food does not commend us to Elohim, for we are none the better if we eat, nor any worse for not eating.

<sup>9</sup> But look to it, lest somehow this right of yours become a stumbling-block to those who are weak.

<sup>10</sup> For if anyone sees you who have knowledge eating in an idol’s place, shall not his conscience, if he is weak, be built up to eat food offered to idols?

<sup>11</sup> So this weak brother, for whom Messiah died, shall perish through your knowledge!

<sup>12</sup> Now sinning in this way against the brothers, and wounding their weak conscience, you sin against Messiah.

<sup>13</sup> Therefore, if food makes my brother stumble, I am never again going to eat meat, lest I make my brother stumble.
