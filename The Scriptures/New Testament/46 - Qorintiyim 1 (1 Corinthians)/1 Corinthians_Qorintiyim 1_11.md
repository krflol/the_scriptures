<sup>1</sup> Become imitators of me, as I also am of Messiah.

<sup>2</sup> And I praise you, brothers, that you remember me in every way and keep the traditions as I delivered them to you.

<sup>3</sup> And I wish you to know that the head of every man is the Messiah, and the head of woman is the man, and the head of Messiah is Elohim.

<sup>4</sup> Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, brings shame to his Head.

<sup>5</sup> And every woman praying or prophesying with her head uncovered brings shame to her head, for that is one and the same as if her head were shaved.

<sup>6</sup> For if a woman is not covered, let her also be shorn. But if it is a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaved, let her be covered.

<sup>7</sup> For a man indeed should not cover his head, since he is the likeness and esteem of Elohim, but woman is the esteem of man.

<sup>8</sup> For man is not from woman, but woman from man.

<sup>9</sup> For man also was not created for the woman, but woman for the man.

<sup>10</sup> Because of this the woman ought to have a symbol of authority on her head, because of the messengers.

<sup>11</sup> However, man is not independent of woman, nor woman independent of man, in the Master.

<sup>12</sup> For as the woman was from the man, even so the man also is through the woman. But all are from Elohim.

<sup>13</sup> Judge for yourselves: is it proper for a woman to pray to Elohim with her head uncovered?

<sup>14</sup> Does not nature itself teach you that if a man indeed has long hair, it is a disrespect to him?

<sup>15</sup> And if a woman has long hair, it is an esteem to her, because the long hair has been given to her over against a veil.

<sup>16</sup> If, however, anyone seems to be contentious, we do not have such a habit, nor do the assemblies of Elohim.

<sup>17</sup> And in declaring this I do not praise you, since you come together not for the better but for the worse.

<sup>18</sup> For in the first place, I hear that when you come together as an assembly, there are divisions among you, and to some extent I believe it.

<sup>19</sup> For there have to be factions even among you, so that the approved ones might be revealed among you.

<sup>20</sup> So when you come together in one place, it is not to eat the Master’s supper.

<sup>21</sup> For, when you eat, each one takes his own supper first, and one is hungry and another is drunk.

<sup>22</sup> Have you not houses to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the assembly of Elohim and shame those who have not? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you in this? I do not praise!

<sup>23</sup> For I received from the Master that which I also delivered to you: that the Master יהושע in the night in which He was delivered up took bread,

<sup>24</sup> and having given thanks, He broke it and said, “Take, eat, this is My body which is broken for you; do this in remembrance of Me.”

<sup>25</sup> In the same way also the cup, after supper, saying, “This cup is the renewed covenant in My blood. As often as you drink it, do this in remembrance of Me.”

<sup>26</sup> For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the death of the Master until He comes.

<sup>27</sup> So that whoever should eat this bread or drink this cup of the Master unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Master.

<sup>28</sup> But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup.

<sup>29</sup> For the one who is eating and drinking unworthily, eats and drinks judgment to himself, not discerning the body of the Master.

<sup>30</sup> Because of this many are weak and sick among you, and many sleep.

<sup>31</sup> For if we were to examine ourselves, we would not be judged.

<sup>32</sup> But when we are judged, we are disciplined by the Master, that we should not be condemned with the world.

<sup>33</sup> So then, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.

<sup>34</sup> And if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, lest you come together for judgment. And the rest I shall set in order when I come.

<sup>1</sup> Become imitators of me, as I also am of Messiah.

<sup>2</sup> And I praise you, brothers, that you remember me in every way and keep the traditions as I delivered them to you.

<sup>3</sup> And I wish you to know that the head of every man is the Messiah, and the head of woman is the man, and the head of Messiah is Elohim.
