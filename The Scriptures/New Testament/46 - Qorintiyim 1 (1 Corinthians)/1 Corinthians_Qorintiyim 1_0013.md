<sup>1</sup> If I speak with the tongues of men and of messengers, but do not have love, I have become as sounding brass or a clanging cymbal.

<sup>2</sup> And if I have prophecy, and know all secrets and all knowledge, and if I have all belief, so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am none at all.

<sup>3</sup> And if I give out all my possessions to feed the poor, and if I give my body to be burned, but do not have love, I am not profited at all.

<sup>4</sup> Love is patient, is kind, love does not envy, love does not boast, is not puffed up,

<sup>5</sup> does not behave indecently, does not seek its own, is not provoked, reckons not the evil,

<sup>6</sup> does not rejoice over the unrighteousness, but rejoices in the truth,

<sup>7</sup> it covers all, believes all, expects all, endures all.

<sup>8</sup> Love never fails. And whether there be prophecies, they shall be inactive; or tongues, they shall cease; or knowledge, it shall be inactive.

<sup>9</sup> For we know in part and we prophesy in part.

<sup>10</sup> But when that which is perfect has come, then that which is in part shall be inactive.

<sup>11</sup> When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I thought as a child, I reasoned as a child. But when I became a man, I did away with childish matters.

<sup>12</sup> For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know, as I also have been known.

<sup>13</sup> And now belief, expectation, and love remain â€“ these three. But the greatest of these is love.
