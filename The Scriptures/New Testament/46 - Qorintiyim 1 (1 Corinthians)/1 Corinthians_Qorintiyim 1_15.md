<sup>1</sup> But brothers, I make known to you the Good News, which I brought as Good News to you, which you also did receive, and in which you stand,

<sup>2</sup> through which also you are being saved, if you hold fast that word I brought as Good News to you. Otherwise, you have believed in vain.

<sup>3</sup> For I delivered to you at the first that which I also received: that Messiah died for our sins according to the Scriptures,

<sup>4</sup> and that He was buried, and that He was raised the third day, according to the Scriptures,

<sup>5</sup> and that He was seen by Kĕpha, then by the twelve.

<sup>6</sup> After that He was seen by over five hundred brothers at one time, of whom the greater part remain till now, but some have fallen asleep.

<sup>7</sup> After that He was seen by Ya‛aqoḇ, then by all the emissaries.

<sup>8</sup> And last of all He was seen by me also, as if to one born prematurely.

<sup>9</sup> For I am the least of the emissaries, who am not worthy to be called an emissary, because I persecuted the assembly of Elohim.

<sup>10</sup> But by the favour of Elohim I am what I am, and His favour toward me was not in vain, but I laboured much more than they all, yet not I, but the favour of Elohim with me.

<sup>11</sup> Whether, then, it was I or they, so we proclaimed and so you believed.

<sup>12</sup> And if Messiah is proclaimed that He has been raised from the dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?

<sup>13</sup> And if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Messiah has not been raised.

<sup>14</sup> And if Messiah has not been raised, then our proclaiming is empty, and your belief also empty,

<sup>15</sup> and we are also found false witnesses of Elohim, because we have witnessed of Elohim that He raised up Messiah, whom He did not raise up, if then the dead are not raised.

<sup>16</sup> For if the dead are not raised, then neither Messiah has been raised.

<sup>17</sup> And if Messiah has not been raised, your belief is to no purpose, you are still in your sins!

<sup>18</sup> Then also those who have fallen asleep in Messiah have perished.

<sup>19</sup> If in this life only we have expectation in Messiah, we are of all men the most wretched.

<sup>20</sup> But now Messiah has been raised from the dead, and has become the first-fruit of those having fallen asleep.

<sup>21</sup> For since death is through a man, resurrection of the dead is also through a Man.

<sup>22</sup> For as all die in Aḏam, so also all shall be made alive in Messiah .

<sup>23</sup> And each in his own order: Messiah the first-fruits, then those who are of Messiah at His coming,

<sup>24</sup> then the end, when He delivers up the reign to Elohim the Father, when He has brought to naught all rule and all authority and power.

<sup>25</sup> For He has to reign until He has put all enemies under His feet.

<sup>26</sup> The last enemy to be brought to naught is death.

<sup>27</sup> For “He has put all under His feet.” But when He says “all are put under Him,” it is clear that He who put all under Him is excepted.

<sup>28</sup> And when all are made subject to Him, then the Son Himself shall also be subject to Him who put all under Him, in order that Elohim be all in all.

<sup>29</sup> Otherwise, what shall they do who are immersed for the dead, if the dead are not raised at all? Why indeed are they immersed for the dead?

<sup>30</sup> And why do we stand in danger every hour?

<sup>31</sup> I affirm, by the boasting in you which I have in Messiah יהושע our Master, I die day by day.

<sup>32</sup> If, as men do, I have fought with beasts at Ephesos, of what good is it to me? If the dead are not raised, “Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.”

<sup>33</sup> Do not be led astray, “Evil company corrupts good habits.”

<sup>34</sup> Wake up to soberness, righteously, and do not sin, for some do not have the knowledge of Elohim. I speak this to your shame.

<sup>35</sup> But someone might say, “How are the dead raised up? And with what body do they come?”

<sup>36</sup> Senseless one! What you sow is not made alive unless it dies.

<sup>37</sup> And as to what you sow: you do not sow the body which is to be, but a bare grain, it might be wheat or some other grain.

<sup>38</sup> But Elohim gives it a body as He wishes, and to each seed a body of its own.

<sup>39</sup> All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one flesh of men, and another flesh of beasts, and another of fishes, and another of birds.

<sup>40</sup> And there are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies, but the esteem of the heavenly is truly one, and the esteem of the earthly is another,

<sup>41</sup> one esteem of the sun, and another esteem of the moon, and another esteem of the stars – for star differs from star in esteem.

<sup>42</sup> So also is the resurrection of the dead: it is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption;

<sup>43</sup> it is sown in disrespect, it is raised in esteem; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power;

<sup>44</sup> it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body; there is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.

<sup>45</sup> And so it has been written, “The first man Aḏam became a living being,” the last Aḏam a life-giving Spirit.

<sup>46</sup> The spiritual, however, was not first, but the natural, and afterward the spiritual.

<sup>47</sup> The first man was of the earth, earthy; the second Man is the Master from heaven.

<sup>48</sup> As is the earthy, so also are those who are earthy; and as is the heavenly, so also are those who are heavenly.

<sup>49</sup> And as we have borne the likeness of the earthy, we shall also bear the likeness of the heavenly.

<sup>50</sup> And this I say, brothers, that flesh and blood is unable to inherit the reign of Elohim, neither does corruption inherit incorruption.

<sup>51</sup> See, I speak a secret to you: We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,

<sup>52</sup> in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.

<sup>53</sup> For this corruptible has to put on incorruption, and this mortal to put on immortality.

<sup>54</sup> And when this corruptible has put on incorruption, and this mortal has put on immortality, then shall come to be the word that has been written, “Death is swallowed up in overcoming.”

<sup>55</sup> “O Death, where is your sting? O grave, where is your overcoming?”

<sup>56</sup> And the sting of death is the sin, and the power of the sin is the Torah.

<sup>57</sup> But thanks to Elohim who gives us the overcoming through our Master יהושע Messiah.

<sup>58</sup> Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always excelling in the work of the Master, knowing that your labour is not in vain in the Master.

<sup>1</sup> But brothers, I make known to you the Good News, which I brought as Good News to you, which you also did receive, and in which you stand,

<sup>43</sup> it is sown in disrespect, it is raised in esteem; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power;

<sup>44</sup> it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body; there is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.
