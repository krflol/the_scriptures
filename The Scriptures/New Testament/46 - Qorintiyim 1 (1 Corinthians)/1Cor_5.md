<sup>1</sup> It is commonly reported that there is whoring among you, and such whoring as is not even named among the gentiles, so as one to have his father’s wife!
<sup>2</sup> And you have been puffed up, and did not rather mourn, so that he who has done this deed, be removed from among you!
<sup>3</sup> For I indeed, as absent in body but present in spirit, have already judged the one who did this, as though I were present.
<sup>4</sup> In the Name of our Master יהושע Messiah, when you are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Master יהושע Messiah,
<sup>5</sup> deliver such a one to Satan for destruction of the flesh, in order that his spirit be saved in the day of the Master יהושע.
<sup>6</sup> Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the entire lump?
<sup>7</sup> Therefore cleanse out the old leaven, so that you are a new lump, as you are unleavened. For also Messiah our Passover was offered for us.
<sup>8</sup> So then let us observe the festival, not with old leaven, nor with the leaven of evil and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
<sup>9</sup> I wrote to you in my letter not to keep company with those who whore.
<sup>10</sup> And I certainly did not mean with those of this world who whore, or with the greedy of gain, or swindlers, or idolaters, since then you would need to go out of the world.
<sup>11</sup> But now I have written to you not to keep company with anyone called ‘a brother,’ if he is one who whores, or greedy of gain, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or a swindler – not even to eat with such a one.
<sup>12</sup> For what have I to do with judging outsiders? Do you not judge those who are inside?
<sup>13</sup> But Elohim judges those who are outside. And put away the wicked one from among you!
