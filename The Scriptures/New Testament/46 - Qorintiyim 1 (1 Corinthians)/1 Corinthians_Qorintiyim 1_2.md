<sup>1</sup> And, when I came to you, brothers, I did not come with excellence of speech or wisdom, proclaiming to you the witness of Elohim.

<sup>2</sup> For I resolved not to know any matter among you except יהושע Messiah and Him impaled.

<sup>3</sup> And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.

<sup>4</sup> And my word and my preaching were not with persuasive words of man’s wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power,

<sup>5</sup> in order that your belief should not be in the wisdom of men but in the power of Elohim.

<sup>6</sup> Yet we speak wisdom among those who are perfect, and not the wisdom of this age, nor of the rulers of this age that are being brought to naught.

<sup>7</sup> But we speak the wisdom of Elohim, which was hidden in a secret, and which Elohim ordained before the ages for our esteem,

<sup>8</sup> which no one of the rulers of this age knew, for if they had known, they would not have impaled the Master of esteem.

<sup>9</sup> But as it has been written, “Eye has not seen, and ear has not heard, nor have entered into the heart of man what Elohim has prepared for those who love Him.”

<sup>10</sup> But Elohim has revealed them to us through His Spirit. For the Spirit searches all matters, even the depths of Elohim.

<sup>11</sup> For who among men knows the thoughts of a man except the spirit of the man that is in him? So also, the thoughts of Elohim no one has known, except the Spirit of Elohim.

<sup>12</sup> And we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit that is from Elohim, in order to know what Elohim has favourably given us,

<sup>13</sup> which we also speak, not in words which man’s wisdom teaches but which the Set-apart Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual matters with spiritual matters.

<sup>14</sup> But the natural man does not receive the matters of the Spirit of Elohim, for they are foolishness to him, and he is unable to know them, because they are spiritually discerned.

<sup>15</sup> But he who is spiritual discerns indeed all matters, but he himself is discerned by no one.

<sup>16</sup> For “Who has known the mind of יהוה ? Who shall instruct Him?” But we have the mind of Messiah.
