<sup>1</sup> Should any of you, holding a matter against another, go to be judged before the unrighteous, and not before the set-apart ones?

<sup>2</sup> Do you not know that the set-apart ones shall judge the world? And if the world is judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?

<sup>3</sup> Do you not know that we shall judge messengers? How much more, matters of this life?

<sup>4</sup> If then you truly have judgments of this life, do you appoint them as judges who are least esteemed by the assembly?

<sup>5</sup> I say this to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise one among you, not even one, who shall be able to judge between his brothers?

<sup>6</sup> But brother against brother goes to be judged and that before unbelievers!

<sup>7</sup> Already, then, there is a failure with you, that you have lawsuits among you. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be cheated?

<sup>8</sup> But you yourselves do wrong and cheat, and that to your brothers!

<sup>9</sup> Do you not know that the unrighteous shall not inherit the reign of Elohim? Do not be deceived. Neither those who whore, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals,

<sup>10</sup> nor thieves, nor greedy of gain, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers shall inherit the reign of Elohim.

<sup>11</sup> And such were some of you. But you were washed, but you were set apart, but you were declared right in the Name of the Master יהושע and by the Spirit of our Elohim.

<sup>12</sup> All is permitted me, but not all do profit. All is permitted me, but I shall not be under authority of any.

<sup>13</sup> Foods for the stomach and the stomach for foods – but Elohim shall destroy both it and them. And the body is not for whoring but for the Master, and the Master for the body.

<sup>14</sup> And Elohim, who raised up the Master, shall also raise us up through His power.

<sup>15</sup> Do you not know that your bodies are members of Messiah? Shall I then take the members of Messiah and make them members of a whore? Let it not be!

<sup>16</sup> Or do you not know that he who is joined to a whore is one body? For He says, “The two shall become one flesh.”

<sup>17</sup> And he who is joined to the Master is one spirit.

<sup>18</sup> Flee whoring. Every sin that a man does is outside the body, but he who commits whoring sins against his own body.

<sup>19</sup> Or do you not know that your body is the Dwelling Place of the Set-apart Spirit who is in you, which you have from Elohim, and you are not your own?

<sup>20</sup> For you were bought with a price, therefore esteem Elohim in your body and in your spirit, which are of Elohim.
