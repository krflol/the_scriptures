<sup>1</sup> Elohim, having of old spoken in many portions and many ways to the fathers by the prophets,

<sup>2</sup> has in these last days spoken to us by the Son, whom He has appointed heir of all, through whom also He made the ages,

<sup>3</sup> who being the brightness of the esteem and the exact representation of His substance, and sustaining all by the word of His power, having made a cleansing of our sins through Himself, sat down at the right hand of the Greatness on high,

<sup>4</sup> having become so much better than the messengers, as He has inherited a more excellent Name than them.

<sup>5</sup> For to which of the messengers did He ever say, “You are My Son, today I have brought You forth”? And again, “I shall be to Him a Father, and He shall be to Me a Son”?

<sup>6</sup> And when He again brings the first-born into the world, He says, “Let all the messengers of Elohim do reverence to Him.”

<sup>7</sup> And of the messengers indeed He says, “... who is making His messengers spirits and His servants a flame of fire.”

<sup>8</sup> But to the Son He says, “Your throne, O Elohim, is forever and ever, a sceptre of straightness is the sceptre of Your reign.

<sup>9</sup> “You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness.Because of this, Elohim, Your Elohim,has anointed You with the oil of gladness more than Your companions.”

<sup>10</sup> And, “You, Master, did found the earth in the beginning, and the heavens are the work of Your hands.

<sup>11</sup> “They shall perish, but You remain. And they shall all grow old like a garment,

<sup>12</sup> and like a mantle You shall fold them up, and they shall be changed. But You are the same, and Your years shall not fail.”

<sup>13</sup> And to which of the messengers did He ever say, “Sit at My right hand, until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet”?

<sup>14</sup> Are they not all serving spirits sent out to attend those who are about to inherit deliverance?
