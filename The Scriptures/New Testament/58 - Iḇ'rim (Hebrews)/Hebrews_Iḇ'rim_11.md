<sup>1</sup> And belief is the substance of what is expected, the proof of what is not seen.

<sup>2</sup> For by this the elders obtained witness.

<sup>3</sup> By belief, we understand that the ages were prepared by the word of Elohim, so that what is seen was not made of what is visible.

<sup>4</sup> By belief, Heḇel offered to Elohim a greater slaughter offering than Qayin, through which he obtained witness that he was righteous, Elohim witnessing of his gifts. And through it, having died, he still speaks.

<sup>5</sup> By belief, Ḥanoḵ was translated so as not to see death, “and was not found because Elohim had translated him.” For before his translation he obtained witness, that he pleased Elohim.

<sup>6</sup> But without belief it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to Elohim has to believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who earnestly seek Him.

<sup>7</sup> By belief, Noaḥ, having been warned of what was yet unseen, having feared, prepared an ark to save his house, through which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is according to belief.

<sup>8</sup> By belief, Aḇraham obeyed when he was called to go out to the place which he was about to receive as an inheritance. And he went out, not knowing where he was going.

<sup>9</sup> By belief, he sojourned in the land of promise as a stranger, dwelling in tents with Yitsḥaq and Ya‛aqoḇ, the heirs with him of the same promise,

<sup>10</sup> for he was looking for the city having foundations, whose builder and maker is Elohim.

<sup>11</sup> By belief also, Sarah herself was enabled to conceive seed, and she bore a child when she was past the normal age, because she deemed Him trustworthy who had promised.

<sup>12</sup> And so from one, and him as good as dead, were born as numerous as the stars of the heaven, as countless as the sand which is by the seashore.

<sup>13</sup> In belief all these died, not having received the promises, but seeing them from a distance, welcomed and embraced them, and confessed that they were aliens and strangers on the earth.

<sup>14</sup> For those who speak this way make it clear that they seek a fatherland.

<sup>15</sup> And yet, if they had indeed kept remembering that place from which they had come out, they would have had the chance to return.

<sup>16</sup> But now they long for a better place, that is, a heavenly. Therefore Elohim is not ashamed to be called their Elohim, for He has prepared a city for them.

<sup>17</sup> By belief, Aḇraham, when he was tried, offered up Yitsḥaq, and he who had received the promises offered up his only brought-forth son,

<sup>18</sup> of whom it was said, “In Yitsḥaq your seed shall be called,”

<sup>19</sup> reckoning that Elohim was able to raise, even from the dead, from which he received him back, as a type.

<sup>20</sup> By belief, Yitsḥaq blessed Ya‛aqoḇ and Ĕsaw concerning that which was to come.

<sup>21</sup> By belief, Ya‛aqoḇ, when he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Yosĕph, and did reverence on the top of his staff.

<sup>22</sup> By belief, Yosĕph, when he was dying, made mention of the outgoing of the children of Yisra’ĕl, and gave orders concerning his bones.

<sup>23</sup> By belief, Mosheh, having been born, was hidden three months by his parents, because they saw he was a comely child, and were not afraid of the sovereign’s command.

<sup>24</sup> By belief, Mosheh, having become great, refused to be called the son of the daughter of Pharaoh,

<sup>25</sup> choosing rather to be afflicted with the people of Elohim than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a time,

<sup>26</sup> deeming the reproach of Messiah greater riches than the treasures in Mitsrayim, for he was looking to the reward.

<sup>27</sup> By belief, he left Mitsrayim, not fearing the wrath of the sovereign, for he was steadfast, as seeing Him who is invisible.

<sup>28</sup> By belief, he performed the Passover and the sprinkling of blood, lest he who destroyed the first-born should touch them.

<sup>29</sup> By belief, they passed through the Red Sea as by dry land, and when the Mitsrites tried it, they were drowned.

<sup>30</sup> By belief, the walls of Yeriḥo fell, having been surrounded for seven days.

<sup>31</sup> By belief, Raḥaḇ the whore did not perish with those who did not believe, having received the spies with peace.

<sup>32</sup> And what more shall I say? For the time would fail me to relate of Gid‛on and Baraq and Shimshon and Yiphtaḥ, also of Dawiḏ and Shemu’ĕl and the prophets,

<sup>33</sup> who through belief, overcame reigns, worked righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,

<sup>34</sup> quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, became mighty in battle, put foreign armies to flight.

<sup>35</sup> Women received back their dead by resurrection. And others were tortured, not accepting release, to obtain a better resurrection.

<sup>36</sup> And others had trial of mockings and floggings and more, of chains and imprisonment.

<sup>37</sup> They were stoned, they were tried, they were sawn in two, they were slain with the sword. They went about in sheepskins, in goatskins, being in need, afflicted, mistreated,

<sup>38</sup> of whom the world was not worthy – wandering in deserts and mountains and caves and holes of the earth.

<sup>39</sup> And having obtained witness through the belief, all these did not receive the promise,

<sup>40</sup> Elohim having provided what is better for us, that they should not be made perfect apart from us.
