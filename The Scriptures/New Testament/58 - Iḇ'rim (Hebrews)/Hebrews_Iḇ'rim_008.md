<sup>1</sup> Now the summary of what we are saying is: We have such a High Priest, who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the Greatness in the heavens,

<sup>2</sup> and who serves in the set-apart place and of the true Tent, which יהוה set up, and not man.

<sup>3</sup> For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and slaughters. So it was also necessary for this One to have somewhat to offer.

<sup>4</sup> For if indeed He were on earth, He would not be a priest, since there are priests who offer the gifts according to the Torah,

<sup>5</sup> who serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly, as Mosheh was warned when he was about to make the Tent. For He said, “See that you make all according to the pattern shown you on the mountain.”

<sup>6</sup> But now He has obtained a more excellent service, inasmuch as He is also Mediatorof a better covenant, which was constituted on better promises.

<sup>7</sup> For if that first covenant had been faultless, then no place would have been sought for a second.

<sup>8</sup> For finding fault with them, He says, “See, the days are coming,” says יהוה, “when I shall conclude with the house of Yisra’ĕl and with the house of Yehuḏah a renewed covenant,

<sup>9</sup> not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Mitsrayim, because they did not continue in My covenant, and I disregarded them,” says יהוה.

<sup>10</sup> “Because this is the covenant that I shall make with the house of Yisra’ĕl after those days, says יהוה, giving My laws in their mind, and I shall write them on their hearts, and I shall be their Elohim, and they shall be My people.

<sup>11</sup> “And they shall by no means teach each one his neighbour, and each one his brother, saying, ‘Know יהוה,’ because they all shall know Me, from the least of them to the greatest of them.

<sup>12</sup> “Because I shall forgive their unrighteousness, and their sins and their lawlessnesses I shall no longer remember.”

<sup>13</sup> By saying, ‘renewed,’ He has made the first old. Now what becomes old and growing aged is near disappearing.
