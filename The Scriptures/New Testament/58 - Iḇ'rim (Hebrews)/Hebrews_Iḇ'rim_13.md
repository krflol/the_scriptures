<sup>1</sup> Let the brotherly love continue.

<sup>2</sup> Do not forget to receive strangers, for by so doing some have unwittingly entertained messengers.

<sup>3</sup> Remember the prisoners as if chained with them, and those being mistreated, since you yourselves also are in the body.

<sup>4</sup> Let marriage be respected by all, and the bed be undefiled. But Elohim shall judge those who whore, and adulterers.

<sup>5</sup> Let your way of life be without the love of money, and be satisfied with what you have. For He Himself has said, “I shall never leave you nor forsake you,”

<sup>6</sup> so that we boldly say, “ יהוה is my helper, I shall not fear what man shall do to me.”

<sup>7</sup> Remember those leading you, who spoke the Word of Elohim to you. Consider the outcome of their way of life and imitate their belief.

<sup>8</sup> יהושע Messiah is the same yesterday, and today, and forever.

<sup>9</sup> Do not be borne about by various and strange teachings. For it is good for the heart to be established by favour, not with foods which have not profited those who have been occupied with them.

<sup>10</sup> We have an altar from which those serving the Tent have no authority to eat.

<sup>11</sup> For the bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the Set-apart Place by the high priest for sin, are burned outside the camp.

<sup>12</sup> And so יהושע also suffered outside the gate, to set apart the people with His own blood.

<sup>13</sup> Let us, then, go to Him outside the camp, bearing His reproach.

<sup>14</sup> For we have no lasting city here, but we seek the one coming.

<sup>15</sup> Through Him then, let us continually offer up a slaughter offering of praise to Elohim, that is, the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to His Name.

<sup>16</sup> And do not forget to do good and to share, for with such slaughter offerings Elohim is well pleased.

<sup>17</sup> Obey those leading you, and be subject to them, for they watch for your lives, as having to give account. Let them do so with joy and not groaning, for that would be of no advantage to you.

<sup>18</sup> Pray for us, for we trust that we have a good conscience, desiring to behave well in every way.

<sup>19</sup> But I particularly encourage you to do this, that I might be restored to you the sooner.

<sup>20</sup> And the Elohim of peace who brought up our Master יהושע from the dead, that great Shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,

<sup>21</sup> make you perfect in every good work to do His desire, working in you what is pleasing in His sight, through יהושע Messiah, to whom be esteem forever and ever. Amĕn.

<sup>22</sup> And I call upon you, brothers, bear with the word of encouragement for I have written to you in few words.

<sup>23</sup> Know that brother Timothy has been released, with whom I shall see you if he comes shortly.

<sup>24</sup> Greet all those leading you, and all the set-apart ones. Those from Italy greet you.

<sup>25</sup> Favour be with you all. Amĕn.
