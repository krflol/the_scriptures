<sup>1</sup> Therefore, having left the word of the beginning of the Messiah, let us go on to perfection, not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of belief toward Elohim,

<sup>2</sup> of the teaching of immersions, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of everlasting judgment.

<sup>3</sup> And this we shall do, if Elohim indeed permits.

<sup>4</sup> For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted the heavenly gift, and have become partakers of the Set-apart Spirit,

<sup>5</sup> and have tasted the good Word of Elohim and the powers of the age to come,

<sup>6</sup> and fall away, to renew them again to repentance – having impaled for themselves the Son of Elohim again, and put Him to open shame.

<sup>7</sup> For ground that is drinking the rain often falling on it, and is bearing plants fit for those by whom it is tilled, receives blessing from Elohim,

<sup>8</sup> but if it brings forth thorns and thistles, it is rejected and near to being cursed, and ends up by being burned.

<sup>9</sup> But although we speak in this way, beloved, we are persuaded, concerning you, of better matters which possess deliverance.

<sup>10</sup> For Elohim is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love which you have shown toward His Name, in that you have attended to the set-apart ones, and still attend.

<sup>11</sup> And we desire that each one of you show the same eagerness, to the entire confirmation of expectation until the end,

<sup>12</sup> in order that you do not become sluggish, but imitate those who through belief and patience inherit the promises.

<sup>13</sup> For Elohim, having promised Aḇraham, since He could swear by no one greater, swore by Himself,

<sup>14</sup> saying, “Truly, blessing I shall bless you, and increasing I shall increase you.”

<sup>15</sup> And so, after being patient, he obtained the promise.

<sup>16</sup> For men do indeed swear by the one greater, and an oath for confirmation is for them an end of all dispute.

<sup>17</sup> In this way Elohim, resolving to show even more clearly to the heirs of promise the unchangeableness of His purpose, confirmed it by an oath,

<sup>18</sup> so that by two unchangeable matters in which it is impossible for Elohim to lie, we might have strong encouragement, we who have fled for refuge to lay hold of the expectation set before us,

<sup>19</sup> which we have as an anchor of the life, both safe and firm, and entering into that within the veil,

<sup>20</sup> where יהושע has entered as a forerunner for us, having become High Priest forever according to the order of Malkitseḏeq.
