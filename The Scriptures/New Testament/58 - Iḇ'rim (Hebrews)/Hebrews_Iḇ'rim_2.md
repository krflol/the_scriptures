<sup>1</sup> Because of this we have to pay more attention to what we have heard, lest we drift away.

<sup>2</sup> For if the word spoken through messengers proved to be firm, and every transgression and disobedience received a right reward,

<sup>3</sup> how shall we escape if we neglect so great a deliverance, which first began to be spoken by the Master, and was confirmed to us by those that heard,

<sup>4</sup> Elohim also bearing witness both with signs and wonders, with various miracles, and gifts of the Set-apart Spirit, distributed according to His own desire?

<sup>5</sup> For it is not to messengers that He has subjected the world to come, concerning which we speak.

<sup>6</sup> But somewhere one has witnessed, saying, “What is man that You remember him, or the son of man that You look after him?

<sup>7</sup> “You have made him a little lower than the messengers. You have crowned him with esteem and respect, and set him over the works of Your hands.

<sup>8</sup> “You have put all in subjection under his feet.” For in that He put all in subjection under him, He left none that is not subjected to him. But now we do not yet see all subjected to him.

<sup>9</sup> But we do see Him who was made for a little while lower than the messengers, יהושע, because of the suffering of death crowned with esteem and respect, that by the favour of Elohim He should taste death for everyone.

<sup>10</sup> For it was fitting for Him, because of whom all are and through whom all are, in bringing many sons to esteem, to make the Princely Leader of their deliverance perfect through sufferings.

<sup>11</sup> For both He who sets apart and those who are being set apart are all of One, for which reason He is not ashamed to call them brothers,

<sup>12</sup> saying, “I shall announce Your Name to My brothers, in the midst of the congregation I shall sing praise to You.”

<sup>13</sup> And again, “I shall put My trust in Him.” And again, “See, I and the children whom Elohim gave Me.”

<sup>14</sup> Therefore, since the children share in flesh and blood, He Himself similarly shared in the same, so that by means of His death He might destroy him having the power of death, that is, the devil,

<sup>15</sup> and deliver those who throughout life were held in slavery by fear of death.

<sup>16</sup> For, doubtless, He does not take hold of messengers, but He does take hold of the seed of Aḇraham.

<sup>17</sup> So in every way He had to be made like His brothers, in order to become a compassionate and trustworthy High Priest in matters related to Elohim, to make atonement for the sins of the people.

<sup>18</sup> For in what He had suffered, Himself being tried, He is able to help those who are tried.
