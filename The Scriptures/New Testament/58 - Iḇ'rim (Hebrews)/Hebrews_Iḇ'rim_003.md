<sup>1</sup> Therefore, set-apart brothers, partakers of the heavenly calling, closely consider the Emissary and High Priest of our confession, Messiah יהושע,

<sup>2</sup> who was trustworthy to Him who appointed Him, as also Mosheh in all His house.

<sup>3</sup> For this One has been deemed worthy of more esteem than Mosheh, as much as He who built the house enjoys more respect than the house.

<sup>4</sup> For every house is built by someone, but He who built all is Elohim.

<sup>5</sup> And Mosheh indeed was trustworthy in all His house as a servant, for a witness of what would be spoken later,

<sup>6</sup> but Messiah as a Son over His own house, whose house we are if we hold fast the boldness and the boasting of the expectation firm to the end.

<sup>7</sup> Therefore, as the Set-apart Spirit says, “Today, if you hear His voice,

<sup>8</sup> do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion, in the day of trial in the wilderness,

<sup>9</sup> where your fathers tried Me, proved Me, and saw My works forty years.

<sup>10</sup> “Therefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, ‘They always go astray in their heart, and they have not known My ways.’

<sup>11</sup> “As I swore in My wrath, ‘If they shall enter into My rest...’ ”

<sup>12</sup> Look out, brothers, lest there be in any of you a wicked heart of unbelief in falling away from the living Elohim,

<sup>13</sup> but encourage one another daily, while it is called “Today,” lest any of you be hardened by the deceivableness of sin.

<sup>14</sup> For we have become partakers of Messiah if we hold fast the beginning of our trust firm to the end,

<sup>15</sup> while it is said, “Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion.”

<sup>16</sup> For who, having heard, rebelled? Was it not all who came out of Mitsrayim, led by Mosheh?

<sup>17</sup> And with whom was He grieved forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose corpses fell in the wilderness?

<sup>18</sup> And to whom did He swear that they would not enter into His rest, but to those who did not obey?

<sup>19</sup> So we see that they were unable to enter in because of unbelief.
