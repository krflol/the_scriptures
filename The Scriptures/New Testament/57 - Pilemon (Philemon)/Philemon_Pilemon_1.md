<sup>1</sup> Sha’ul, a prisoner of Messiah יהושע, and Timothy the brother, to Philemon our beloved one and fellow worker,

<sup>2</sup> and Apphia our sister, and Archippos our fellow soldier, and the assembly at your house:

<sup>3</sup> Favour to you and peace from Elohim our Father and the Master יהושע Messiah.

<sup>4</sup> I always thank my Elohim when I mention you in my prayers,

<sup>5</sup> hearing of your love and the belief which you have toward the Master יהושע and toward all the set-apart ones,

<sup>6</sup> so that the sharing of your belief might become working in the knowledge of all the good which is in you toward Messiah יהושע.

<sup>7</sup> For we have much joy and encouragement in your love, because the tender affections of the set-apart ones have been refreshed by you, brother.

<sup>8</sup> Therefore, although I have much boldness in Messiah to command you what is fitting,

<sup>9</sup> because of love, I rather appeal – being such a one as Sha’ul, the aged, and now also a prisoner of יהושע Messiah –

<sup>10</sup> I appeal to you for my child Onesimos, whom I brought forth while in my chains,

<sup>11</sup> who formerly was of no use to you, but now is of good use to you and to me,

<sup>12</sup> whom I sent back to you, and receive him, that is, my own tender affections,

<sup>13</sup> whom I wished to keep with me, that on your behalf he might serve me in my chains for the Good News.

<sup>14</sup> But without your opinion I wished to do none at all, so that your good deed should not be by way of necessity, but voluntary.

<sup>15</sup> For he parted from you for a while, possibly because of this, so that you might have him back forever,

<sup>16</sup> no longer as a slave but more than a slave, as a beloved brother, especially to me, and how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Master.

<sup>17</sup> So, if you regard me as your partner, receive him as you would me.

<sup>18</sup> But if he has wronged you or owes you whatever, put that on my account.

<sup>19</sup> I, Sha’ul, wrote with my own hand. I shall repay – not to mention to you that you indeed owe yourself to me also.

<sup>20</sup> Yes, brother, let me derive pleasure from you in the Master, refresh my tender affections in the Master.

<sup>21</sup> Trusting in your obedience, I wrote to you, knowing that you shall do even more than I say.

<sup>22</sup> And at the same time also prepare a place for me to stay, for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given to you.

<sup>23</sup> Epaphras, fellow prisoner of me in Messiah יהושע, greets you,

<sup>24</sup> and Mark, Aristarchos, Demas, Luke, my fellow workers.

<sup>25</sup> The favour of our Master יהושע Messiah be with your spirit. Amĕn.
