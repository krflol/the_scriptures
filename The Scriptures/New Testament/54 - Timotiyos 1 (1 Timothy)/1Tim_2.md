<sup>1</sup> First of all, then, I urge that petitions, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgiving be made for all men,
<sup>2</sup> for sovereigns and all those who are in authority, in order that we lead a calm and peaceable life in all reverence and seriousness.
<sup>3</sup> For this is good and acceptable before Elohim our Saviour,
<sup>4</sup> who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.
<sup>5</sup> For there is one Elohim, and one Mediator between Elohim and men, the Man Messiah יהושע,
<sup>6</sup> who gave Himself a ransom for all, to be witnessed in its own seasons,
<sup>7</sup> for which I was appointed a proclaimer and an emissary – I am speaking the truth in Messiah and not lying – a teacher of the gentiles in belief and truth.
<sup>8</sup> So I resolve that the men pray everywhere, lifting up hands that are set-apart, without wrath and disputing.
<sup>9</sup> Likewise, that the women dress themselves becomingly, with decency and sensibleness, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or costly garments,
<sup>10</sup> but with good works, which is becoming for women undertaking worship of Elohim.
<sup>11</sup> Let a woman learn in silence, in all subjection.
<sup>12</sup> But I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man, rather, to be in silence.
<sup>13</sup> Because Aḏam was formed first, then Ḥawwah.
<sup>14</sup> And Aḏam was not deceived, but the woman, having been deceived, fell into transgression.
<sup>15</sup> But she shall be saved in childbearing if they continue in belief, and love, and set-apartness, with sensibleness.
