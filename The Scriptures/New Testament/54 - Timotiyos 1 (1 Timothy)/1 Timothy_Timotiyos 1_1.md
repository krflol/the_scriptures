<sup>1</sup> Sha’ul, an emissary of יהושע Messiah, according to a command of Elohim our Saviour, and of the Master יהושע Messiah, our expectation,

<sup>2</sup> to Timothy, a genuine child in the belief: Favour, compassion, peace from Elohim our Father and יהושע Messiah our Master.

<sup>3</sup> As I appealed to you when I went into Makedonia, to remain in Ephesos, in order to command some not to teach differently,

<sup>4</sup> nor to pay attention to fables and endless genealogies, which cause disputes rather than an administration of Elohim which is in belief.

<sup>5</sup> Now the goal of this command is love from a clean heart, from a good conscience and a sincere belief,

<sup>6</sup> which some, having missed the goal, turned aside to senseless talk,

<sup>7</sup> wishing to be teachers of Torah, understanding neither what they say nor concerning what they strongly affirm.

<sup>8</sup> And we know that the Torah is good if one uses it legitimately,

<sup>9</sup> knowing this: that Torah is not laid down for a righteous being, but for the lawless and unruly, for the wicked and for sinners, for the wrong-doers and profane, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers,

<sup>10</sup> for those who whore, for sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and for whatever else that is contrary to sound teaching,

<sup>11</sup> according to the esteemed Good News of the blessed Elohim which was entrusted to me.

<sup>12</sup> And I thank Messiah יהושע our Master who empowered me, because He counted me trustworthy, putting me into service,

<sup>13</sup> me, although I was formerly a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and an insulter. But compassion was shown me because being ignorant I did it in unbelief.

<sup>14</sup> And the favour of our Master was exceedingly increased, with belief and love which are in Messiah יהושע.

<sup>15</sup> Trustworthy is the word and worthy of all acceptance, that Messiah יהושע came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am foremost.

<sup>16</sup> But because of this I received compassion, so that in me first, יהושע Messiah might display all patience, as an example to those who are going to believe on Him for everlasting life.

<sup>17</sup> Now to the Sovereign of the ages, incorruptible, invisible, to Elohim who alone is wise, be respect and esteem forever and ever. Amĕn.

<sup>18</sup> This charge I entrust to you, son Timothy, according to the prophecies previously made concerning you, that by them you might wage the good campaign,

<sup>19</sup> having belief and a good conscience, which some have thrust aside and suffered shipwreck concerning their belief.

<sup>20</sup> Among these are Humenaios and Alexander, whom I delivered to Satan, in order to be taught not to blaspheme.
