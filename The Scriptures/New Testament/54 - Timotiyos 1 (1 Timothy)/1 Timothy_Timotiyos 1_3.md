<sup>1</sup> Trustworthy is the word: If a man longs for the position of an overseer, he desires a good work.

<sup>2</sup> An overseer, then, should be blameless, the husband of one wife, sober, sensible, orderly, kind to strangers, able to teach,

<sup>3</sup> not given to wine, no brawler, but gentle, not quarrelsome, no lover of money,

<sup>4</sup> one who rules his own house well, having his children in subjection with all reverence,

<sup>5</sup> for if a man does not know how to rule his own house, how shall he look after the assembly of Elohim?

<sup>6</sup> Not a new convert, lest he become puffed up with pride and fall into the judgment of the devil.

<sup>7</sup> And he should even have a good witness from those who are outside, lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.

<sup>8</sup> Likewise attendants are to be reverent, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy for filthy gain,

<sup>9</sup> holding to the secret of the belief with a clean conscience.

<sup>10</sup> And let these also be proved first, then let them serve, if they are unreprovable.

<sup>11</sup> Wives in the same way: reverent, not false accusers, sober, trustworthy in every way.

<sup>12</sup> Let attendants be the husbands of only one wife, ruling children and their own houses well.

<sup>13</sup> For those who have served well as attendants gain good standing for themselves, and much boldness in the belief that is in Messiah יהושע.

<sup>14</sup> I am writing you this, expecting to come to you shortly,

<sup>15</sup> but if I delay, that you might know how you should behave in the House of Elohim, which is the assembly of the living Elohim – a strong support and foundation of the truth.

<sup>16</sup> And, beyond all question, the secret of reverence is great – who was revealed in the flesh, declared right in Spirit, was seen by messengers, was proclaimed among nations, was believed on in the world, was taken up in esteem.
