<sup>1</sup> But the Spirit distinctly says that in latter times some shall fall away from the belief, paying attention to misleading spirits, and teachings of demons,
<sup>2</sup> speaking lies in hypocrisy, having been branded on their own conscience,
<sup>3</sup> forbidding to marry, saying to abstain from foods which Elohim created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.
<sup>4</sup> Because every creature of Elohim is good, and none is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving,
<sup>5</sup> for it is set apart by the Word of Elohim and prayer.
<sup>6</sup> If you present these matters to the brothers, you shall be a good servant of יהושע Messiah, being nourished in the words of belief and of the good teaching which you have followed closely.
<sup>7</sup> But refuse profane and old wives’ fables, and exercise yourself rather to reverence.
<sup>8</sup> For bodily exercise is profitable for a little, but reverence is profitable for all, having promise of the present life, and of that which is to come.
<sup>9</sup> Trustworthy is the word, and worthy of all acceptance.
<sup>10</sup> It is for this that we labour and struggle, because we trust in the living Elohim, who is the Saviour of all men, particularly of those who believe.
<sup>11</sup> Command and teach these matters.
<sup>12</sup> Let no one look down on your youth, but be an example to the believers in word, in behaviour, in love, in spirit, in belief, in cleanliness.
<sup>13</sup> Until I come, give attention to reading of Scripture, to encouragement, to teaching.
<sup>14</sup> Do not neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to you by prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the elderhood.
<sup>15</sup> Practise these matters, be in them, so that your progress might be plain to all.
<sup>16</sup> Pay attention to yourself and to the teaching. Continue in them, for in doing this you shall save both yourself and those who hear you.
