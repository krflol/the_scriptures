<sup>1</sup> And when He completed all His words in the hearing of the people, He went into Kephar Naḥum.

<sup>2</sup> And a certain captain’s servant, who was valuable to him, was sick and about to die.

<sup>3</sup> And hearing about יהושע, he sent elders of the Yehuḏim to Him, asking Him to come and heal his servant.

<sup>4</sup> And when they came to יהושע, they begged Him earnestly, saying, “He is worthy for You to grant this to him,

<sup>5</sup> for he loves our nation, and has built the congregation for us.”

<sup>6</sup> So יהושע went with them. However, He was not far from the house when the captain sent friends to Him, saying to Him, “Master, do not trouble Yourself, for I am not worthy that You should come under my roof.

<sup>7</sup> “For this reason I did not even think myself worthy to come to You. But say a word, and my servant shall be healed.

<sup>8</sup> “For I too am a man appointed under authority, having soldiers under me. And I say to one, ‘Go,’ and he goes, and to another, ‘Come,’ and he comes, and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”

<sup>9</sup> And when יהושע heard this, He marvelled at him, and turned around and said to the crowd that followed Him, “I say to you, not even in Yisra’ĕl have I found such great belief!”

<sup>10</sup> And those who were sent, returning to the house, found the servant who had been sick in good health.

<sup>11</sup> And it came to be the next day, that He went into a city called Na‛im. And many of His taught ones went with Him, and a large crowd.

<sup>12</sup> And see, as He came near the gate of the city a dead man was being carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. And a large crowd from the city was with her.

<sup>13</sup> And when the Master saw her, He had compassion on her and said to her, “Do not weep.”

<sup>14</sup> And coming near He touched the bier, and those bearing it stood still. And He said, “Young man, I say to you, arise.”

<sup>15</sup> And he who was dead sat up and began to speak, and He gave him to his mother.

<sup>16</sup> And fear seized all, and they praised Elohim, saying, “A great prophet has been raised up among us,” and, “Elohim has visited His people.”

<sup>17</sup> And this news about Him went out in all Yehuḏah and all the neighbourhood.

<sup>18</sup> And the taught ones of Yoḥanan reported to him about all this.

<sup>19</sup> And Yoḥanan, calling two of his taught ones near, sent to יהושע, saying, “Are You the Coming One, or should we look for another?”

<sup>20</sup> And coming to Him, the men said, “Yoḥanan the Immerser has sent us to You, saying, ‘Are You the Coming One, or should we look for another?’ ”

<sup>21</sup> And in the same hour He healed many of diseases, and afflictions, and wicked spirits. And He gave sight to many blind ones.

<sup>22</sup> And יהושע answering, said to them, “Go, report to Yoḥanan what you have seen and heard: blind receive sight, lame do walk, lepers are cleansed, deaf do hear, dead are raised, the Good News is brought to the poor.

<sup>23</sup> “And blessed is he who shall not stumble in Me.”

<sup>24</sup> And when the messengers of Yoḥanan had left, He began to speak to the crowds concerning Yoḥanan, “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?

<sup>25</sup> “But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft garments? Look, those who are splendidly dressed and living in luxury are in the houses of sovereigns.

<sup>26</sup> “But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yea, I say to you, and more than a prophet.

<sup>27</sup> “This is he concerning whom it has been written, ‘See, I send My messenger before Your face, who shall prepare Your way before You.’

<sup>28</sup> “For I say to you, among those born of women there is not a greater prophet than Yoḥanan the Immerser, but he who is least in the reign of Elohim is greater than he.”

<sup>29</sup> And all the people, even the tax collectors, when they heard, declared Elohim righteous, having been immersed with the immersion of Yoḥanan.

<sup>30</sup> But the Pharisees and those learned in the Torah rejected the counsel of Elohim for themselves, not having been immersed by him.

<sup>31</sup> And the Master said, “To what then shall I compare the men of this generation, and what are they like?

<sup>32</sup> “They are like children sitting in the market-place and calling to each other, saying, ‘We played the flute for you and you did not dance, we lamented for you and you did not weep.’

<sup>33</sup> “For Yoḥanan the Immerser came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, ‘He has a demon.’

<sup>34</sup> “The Son of Aḏam has come eating and drinking, and you say, ‘Look, a man, a glutton and a winedrinker, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’

<sup>35</sup> “And wisdom is declared right by all her children.”

<sup>36</sup> And one of the Pharisees asked Him to eat with him. And He went into the Pharisee’s house, and sat down to eat.

<sup>37</sup> And see, a woman in the city who was a sinner, when she knew that יהושע sat at the table in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster flask of perfume.

<sup>38</sup> And standing behind, at His feet, weeping, she began to wet His feet with her tears, and wiping them with the hair of her head, and was kissing His feet and anointing them with the perfume.

<sup>39</sup> And when the Pharisee who had invited Him saw this, he spoke to himself, saying, “This One, if He were a prophet, would know who and what kind of woman this is who is touching Him, for she is a sinner.”

<sup>40</sup> And יהושע answering, said to him, “Shim‛on, I have somewhat to say to you.” And he said, “Teacher, say it.”

<sup>41</sup> “A certain creditor had two debtors. The one owed five hundred pieces of silver, and the other fifty.

<sup>42</sup> “And when they were unable to repay, he forgave them both. Which of them, then, shall love him more?”

<sup>43</sup> And Shim‛on answering, said, “I suppose the one whom he forgave more.” And He said to him, “You have rightly judged.”

<sup>44</sup> And turning to the woman He said to Shim‛on, “Do you see this woman? I came into your house – you gave Me no water for My feet, but she has wetted My feet with her tears and wiped them with the hair of her head.

<sup>45</sup> “You gave Me no kiss, but she has not ceased to kiss My feet since the time I came in.

<sup>46</sup> “You did not anoint My head with oil, but she anointed My feet with perfume.

<sup>47</sup> “Therefore I say to you, her many sins have been forgiven, because she loved much. But to whom little is forgiven, he loves little.”

<sup>48</sup> And He said to her, “Your sins have been forgiven.”

<sup>49</sup> And those who were sitting at the table with Him began to say among themselves, “Who is this who even forgives sins?”

<sup>50</sup> And He said to the woman, “Your belief has saved you. Go in peace.”

<sup>1</sup> And when He completed all His words in the hearing of the people, He went into Kephar Naḥum.

<sup>2</sup> And a certain captain’s servant, who was valuable to him, was sick and about to die.
