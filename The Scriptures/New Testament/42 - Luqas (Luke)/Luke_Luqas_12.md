<sup>1</sup> Meanwhile, when an innumerable crowd of people had gathered together, so that they trampled one another, He began to say to His taught ones, first, “Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.

<sup>2</sup> “And whatever is concealed shall be revealed, and whatever is hidden shall be known.

<sup>3</sup> “So, whatever you have said in the dark shall be heard in the light, and what you have spoken in the ear in inner rooms shall be proclaimed on the house-tops.

<sup>4</sup> “But I say to you, My friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body, and after that are unable to do any more.

<sup>5</sup> “But I shall show you whom you should fear: Fear the One who, after killing, possesses authority to cast into Gehenna. Yea, I say to you, fear Him!

<sup>6</sup> “Are not five sparrows sold for two copper coins? And not one of them is forgotten before Elohim.

<sup>7</sup> “But even the hairs of your head have all been numbered. Do not fear, you are worth more than many sparrows.

<sup>8</sup> “And I say to you, everyone who confesses Me before men, the Son of Aḏam shall also confess him before the messengers of Elohim.

<sup>9</sup> “But he that has denied Me before men shall be denied before the messengers of Elohim.

<sup>10</sup> “And everyone who shall speak a word against the Son of Aḏam, it shall be forgiven him, but to him who has blasphemed against the Set-apart Spirit, it shall not be forgiven.

<sup>11</sup> “And when they bring you to the congregations and rulers and authorities, do not worry about how or what you should answer, or what you should say,

<sup>12</sup> for the Set-apart Spirit shall teach you in that very hour what you should say.”

<sup>13</sup> And someone from the crowd said to Him, “Teacher, speak to my brother, to divide the inheritance with me.”

<sup>14</sup> But He said to him, “Man, who made Me a judge or divider over you?”

<sup>15</sup> And He said to them, “Mind, and beware of greed, because one’s life does not consist in the excess of his possessions.”

<sup>16</sup> He then spoke a parable to them, saying, “The land of a certain rich man yielded well.

<sup>17</sup> “And he was reasoning within himself, saying, ‘What shall I do, because I have no room to store my crops?’

<sup>18</sup> “And he said, ‘I am going to do this: pull down my storehouses and build greater, and store all my crops and my goods there,

<sup>19</sup> then say to myself, “Life, you have many goods laid up for many years, take your ease, eat, drink, rejoice.” ’

<sup>20</sup> “But Elohim said to him, ‘You mindless one! This night your life shall be demanded from you. And who shall own what you have prepared?’

<sup>21</sup> “So is he who is storing up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward Elohim.”

<sup>22</sup> And He said to His taught ones, “For this reason I say to you, do not worry about your life, what you shall eat; nor about the body, what you shall put on.

<sup>23</sup> “The life is more than the food, and the body is more than the clothing.

<sup>24</sup> “Look at the ravens, for they neither sow nor reap, which have neither storehouse nor granary, and Elohim feeds them. How much more valuable are you than the birds?

<sup>25</sup> “And which of you by worrying is able to add one cubit to his life’s span?

<sup>26</sup> “If then you are unable to do the least, why do you worry about the rest?

<sup>27</sup> “Look at the lilies, how they grow. They neither toil nor spin, and I say to you, even Shelomoh in all his esteem was not dressed like one of these.

<sup>28</sup> “And if Elohim so clothes the grass, which today exists in the field and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace, how much more you, O you of little belief?

<sup>29</sup> “And do not seek what you shall eat or what you shall drink, and do not keep worrying.

<sup>30</sup> “For the gentiles of the world seek all these, and your Father knows that you need these.

<sup>31</sup> “But seek the reign of Elohim, and all these shall be added to you.

<sup>32</sup> “Do not fear, little flock, because your Father did delight to give you the reign.

<sup>33</sup> “Sell your possessions and give in kindness. Make yourselves purses which do not grow old, a treasure in the heavens that does not fail, where no thief does come near nor moth destroys.

<sup>34</sup> “For where your treasure is, there your heart shall be also.

<sup>35</sup> “Let your loins be girded and your lamps burning,

<sup>36</sup> and be like men waiting for their master, when he shall return from the wedding, that when he comes and knocks they open to him immediately.

<sup>37</sup> “Blessed are those servants whom the master, when he comes, shall find watching. Truly, I say to you that he shall gird himself and make them sit down to eat, and shall come and serve them.

<sup>38</sup> “And if he comes in the second watch, or in the third watch, and find them so, blessed are those servants.

<sup>39</sup> “And know this, that if the master of the house had known what hour the thief comes, he would have watched and not allowed his house to be broken into.

<sup>40</sup> “And you, then, be ready, for the Son of Aḏam is coming at an hour you do not expect.”

<sup>41</sup> And Kĕpha said to Him, “Master, do You speak this parable to us, or also to all?”

<sup>42</sup> And the Master said, “Who then is the trustworthy and wise manager, whom his master shall appoint over his household, to give the portion of food in due season?

<sup>43</sup> “Blessed is that servant whom his master shall find so doing when he comes.

<sup>44</sup> “Truly, I say to you that he shall appoint him over all his possessions.

<sup>45</sup> “But if that servant says in his heart, ‘My master is delaying his coming,’ and begins to beat the male servants and female servants, and to eat and drink and be drunk,

<sup>46</sup> the master of that servant shall come on a day when he does not expect him, and at an hour that he does not know, and shall cut him in two and appoint his portion with the unbelievers.

<sup>47</sup> “And that servant who knew his master’s desire, and did not prepare, nor did according to his desire, shall be beaten with many stripes.

<sup>48</sup> “But he who did not know, yet did what deserved flogging, shall be beaten with few. And everyone to whom much is given, from him much shall be demanded. And to whom much has been entrusted, from him much more shall be asked.

<sup>49</sup> “I came to send fire on the earth, and how I wish it were already kindled!

<sup>50</sup> “But I have an immersion to be immersed with, and how distressed I am until it is accomplished!

<sup>51</sup> “Do you think that I came to give peace on earth? I say to you, no, but rather division.

<sup>52</sup> “For from now on five in one house shall be divided, three against two, and two against three –

<sup>53</sup> father shall be divided against son, and son against father, mother against daughter, and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.”

<sup>54</sup> And He also said to the crowds, “When you see a cloud rising out of the west, immediately you say, ‘A storm is coming,’ and so it is.

<sup>55</sup> “And when you see the south wind blow, you say, ‘There shall be hot weather,’ and it is.

<sup>56</sup> “Hypocrites! You know to discern the face of the heaven and of the earth, but how is it you do not discern this time?

<sup>57</sup> “And why, also, do you not judge for yourselves what is right?

<sup>58</sup> “For, as you go with your opponent to a ruler, try hard along the way to settle with him, lest he drag you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison.

<sup>59</sup> “I say to you, you shall certainly not leave there until you have paid even the last mite.”
