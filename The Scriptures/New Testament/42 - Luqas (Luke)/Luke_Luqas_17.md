<sup>1</sup> And He said to the taught ones, “It is inevitable that stumbling-blocks should come, but woe to him through whom they come!

<sup>2</sup> “It would be better for him if a millstone is put around his neck, and he were thrown into the sea, than that he should cause one of these little ones to stumble.

<sup>3</sup> “Take heed to yourselves. If your brother sins against you, rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive him.

<sup>4</sup> “And if he sins against you seven times in a day, and seven times in a day comes back to you, saying, ‘I repent,’ you shall forgive him.”

<sup>5</sup> And the emissaries said to the Master, “Give us more belief.”

<sup>6</sup> And the Master said, “If you have belief as a mustard seed, you would say to this mulberry tree, ‘Be pulled up by the roots and be planted in the sea,’ and it would obey you.

<sup>7</sup> “But who of you, having a servant ploughing or shepherding, would say to him when he has come in from the field, ‘Come immediately and sit down to eat’?

<sup>8</sup> “But would he not rather say to him, ‘Prepare somewhat for my supper, and gird yourself and serve me while I eat and drink, and afterward you shall eat and drink’?

<sup>9</sup> “Would he thank that servant because he did what he was commanded? I think not.

<sup>10</sup> “So also you, when you have done all that you were commanded, say, ‘We are unworthy servants, we have done what was our duty to do.’ ”

<sup>11</sup> And it came to be, as He went to Yerushalayim, that He passed through the midst of Shomeron and Galil.

<sup>12</sup> And as He was entering into a certain village, He was met by ten leprous men, who stood at a distance.

<sup>13</sup> And they lifted up their voices, saying, “ יהושע, Master, have compassion on us!”

<sup>14</sup> And having seen them, He said to them, “Go, show yourselves to the priests.” And it came to be, that as they were going, they were cleansed.

<sup>15</sup> And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, returned, praising Elohim with a loud voice,

<sup>16</sup> and he fell down upon his face at His feet, giving thanks to Him. And he was a Shomeronite.

<sup>17</sup> And יהושע answering, said, “Were there not ten cleansed? But where are the nine?

<sup>18</sup> “Was no one found to return to give praise to Elohim, except this foreigner?”

<sup>19</sup> And He said to him, “Rise, go your way. Your belief has made you well.”

<sup>20</sup> And having been asked by the Pharisees when the reign of Elohim would come, He answered them and said, “The reign of Elohim does not come with intent watching,

<sup>21</sup> nor shall they say, ‘Look here!’ or ‘Look there!’ For look, the reign of Elohim is in your midst!”

<sup>22</sup> And He said to the taught ones, “Days shall come when you shall long to see one of the days of the Son of Aḏam, but you shall not see it.

<sup>23</sup> “And they shall say to you, ‘Look here!’ or ‘Look there!’ Do not go after them, nor follow.

<sup>24</sup> “For as the lightning that flashes out of one part under heaven shines to the other part under heaven, so also the Son of Aḏam shall be in His day.

<sup>25</sup> “But first He has to suffer much and be rejected by this generation.

<sup>26</sup> “And as it came to be in the days of Noaḥ, so also shall it be in the days of the Son of Aḏam:

<sup>27</sup> “They were eating, they were drinking, they were marrying, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noaḥ went into the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all.

<sup>28</sup> “And likewise, as it came to be in the days of Lot: They were eating, they were drinking, they were buying, they were selling, they were planting, they were building,

<sup>29</sup> but on the day Lot went out of Seḏom it rained fire and sulphur from heaven and destroyed all.

<sup>30</sup> “It shall be the same in the day the Son of Aḏam is revealed.

<sup>31</sup> “In that day, he who shall be on the house-top, and his goods in the house, let him not come down to take them away. And likewise the one who is in the field, let him not turn back.

<sup>32</sup> “Remember the wife of Lot.

<sup>33</sup> “Whoever seeks to save his life shall lose it, and whoever loses his life shall preserve it.

<sup>34</sup> “I say to you, in that night there shall be two in one bed, the one shall be taken and the other shall be left.

<sup>35</sup> “Two shall be grinding together, the one shall be taken and the other shall be left.

<sup>36</sup> “Two shall be in the field, the one shall be taken and the other shall be left.”

<sup>37</sup> And they answering, said to Him, “Where, Master?” And He said to them, “Where the body is, there also the eagles shall be gathered together.”
