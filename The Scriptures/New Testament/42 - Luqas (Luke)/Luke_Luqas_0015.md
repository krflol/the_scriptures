<sup>1</sup> Now all the tax collectors and the sinners were coming to Him to hear Him.

<sup>2</sup> And the Pharisees and scribes grumbled, saying, “This One receives sinners and eats with them.”

<sup>3</sup> And He spoke this parable to them, saying,

<sup>4</sup> “What man among you, having a hundred sheep, and having lost one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness and go after the one which is lost until he finds it?

<sup>5</sup> “And having found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing.

<sup>6</sup> “And having come home, he calls together his friends and neighbours, saying to them, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost!’

<sup>7</sup> “I say to you that in the same way there shall be more joy in the heaven over one sinner repenting, than over ninety-nine righteous ones who need no repentance.

<sup>8</sup> “Or what woman, having ten silver coins, if she loses one coin, does not light a lamp and sweep the house, and seek diligently till she finds it?

<sup>9</sup> “And having found it, she calls friends and neighbours together, saying, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found the coin which I lost!’

<sup>10</sup> “I say to you, in the same way there is joy in the presence of the messengers of Elohim over one sinner repenting.”

<sup>11</sup> And He said, “A certain man had two sons,

<sup>12</sup> and the younger of them said to his father, ‘Father, give me the portion of goods falling to me.’ And he divided his livelihood between them.

<sup>13</sup> “And not many days after, the younger son, having gathered all together, went away to a distant country, and there wasted his goods with loose living.

<sup>14</sup> “And when he had spent all, there arose a severe scarcity of food throughout that land, and he began to be in need.

<sup>15</sup> “And he went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country, and he sent him to his fields to feed pigs.

<sup>16</sup> “And he was longing to fill his stomach with the pods which the pigs were eating, and no one gave to him.

<sup>17</sup> “But having come to himself, he said, ‘How many of my father’s hired servants have bread enough and to spare, and I am perishing with hunger!

<sup>18</sup> ‘Having risen, I shall go to my father and say to him, “Father, I have sinned against the heaven, and before you,

<sup>19</sup> and I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Make me like one of your hired servants.” ’

<sup>20</sup> “And having risen, he went to his father. And while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was moved with compassion, and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him.

<sup>21</sup> “And the son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against the heaven, and before you, and I am no longer worthy to be called your son.’

<sup>22</sup> “But the father said to his servants, ‘Bring out the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet.

<sup>23</sup> ‘And bring the fattened calf here and slaughter it, and let us eat and rejoice,

<sup>24</sup> because this son of mine was dead and is alive again, and he was lost and is found.’ And they began to rejoice.

<sup>25</sup> “And his older son was in the field, and when he came and approached the house, he heard music and dancing.

<sup>26</sup> “And having called one of the servants he asked what this meant.

<sup>27</sup> “And he said to him, ‘Your brother has come, and your father has slaughtered the fattened calf because he received him back in health.’

<sup>28</sup> “And he was wroth and would not go in. So his father came out and pleaded with him.

<sup>29</sup> “And answering, he said to his father, ‘See, these many years I have been serving you, and I have never transgressed a command of yours, but to me you have never given a young goat, so I could rejoice with my friends.

<sup>30</sup> ‘But when this son of yours came, who has devoured your livelihood with whores, you slaughtered the fattened calf for him.’

<sup>31</sup> “Then he said to him, ‘Son, you are always with me, and all I have is yours.

<sup>32</sup> ‘And we had to rejoice and be glad, for your brother was dead and is alive, and was lost and is found.’ ”
