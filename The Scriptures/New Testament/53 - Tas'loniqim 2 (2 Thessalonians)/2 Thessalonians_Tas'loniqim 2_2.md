<sup>1</sup> As to the coming of our Master יהושע Messiah and our gathering together to Him, we ask you, brothers,

<sup>2</sup> not to become easily unsettled in mind or troubled, either by spirit or by word or by letter, as if from us, as if the day of יהוה has come.

<sup>3</sup> Let no one deceive you in any way, because the falling away is to come first, and the man of lawlessness is to be revealed, the son of destruction,

<sup>4</sup> who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called Elohim or that is worshipped, so that he sits as Elohim in the Dwelling Place of Elohim, showing himself that he is Elohim.

<sup>5</sup> Do you not remember that I told you this while I was still with you?

<sup>6</sup> And now you know what restrains, for him to be revealed in his time.

<sup>7</sup> For the secret of lawlessness is already at work – only until he who now restrains comes out of the midst.

<sup>8</sup> And then the lawless one shall be revealed, whom the Master shall consume with the Spirit of His mouth and bring to naught with the manifestation of His coming.

<sup>9</sup> The coming of the lawless one is according to the working of Satan, with all power and signs and wonders of falsehood,

<sup>10</sup> and with all deceit of unrighteousness in those perishing, because they did not receive the love of the truth, in order for them to be saved.

<sup>11</sup> And for this reason Elohim sends them a working of delusion, for them to believe the falsehood,

<sup>12</sup> in order that all should be judged who did not believe the truth, but have delighted in the unrighteousness.

<sup>13</sup> But we ought to give thanks to Elohim always for you, brothers, beloved by the Master, because Elohim from the beginning chose you to be saved – in set-apartness of Spirit, and belief in the truth –

<sup>14</sup> unto which He called you by our Good News, for the obtaining of the esteem of our Master יהושע Messiah.

<sup>15</sup> So, then, brothers, stand fast and hold the traditions which you were taught, whether by word or by our letter.

<sup>16</sup> And our Master יהושע Messiah Himself, and our Elohim and Father, who has loved us and given us everlasting encouragement and good expectation, through favour,

<sup>17</sup> encourage your hearts and establish you in every good word and work.
