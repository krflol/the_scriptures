<sup>1</sup> For the rest, brothers, pray for us, so that the Word of יהוה spreads rapidly and be praised, as also with you,

<sup>2</sup> and that we might be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men, for not all have belief.

<sup>3</sup> But the Master is trustworthy, who shall establish you and guard you from the wicked one.

<sup>4</sup> And we trust in the Master as to you, both that you do and shall do what we command you.

<sup>5</sup> And the Master direct your hearts into the love of Elohim and into the endurance for Messiah.

<sup>6</sup> But we command you, brothers, in the Name of our Master יהושע Messiah, that you withdraw from every brother who walks disorderly and not according to the tradition which you received from us.

<sup>7</sup> For you yourselves know how you ought to imitate us, for we were not disorderly among you,

<sup>8</sup> nor did we eat anyone’s bread without paying for it, but worked with labour and toil night and day, in order not to burden any of you,

<sup>9</sup> not because we do not have authority, but to make ourselves an example, for you to imitate us.

<sup>10</sup> For even when we were with you, we commanded you this: If anyone does not wish to work, neither let him eat.

<sup>11</sup> For we hear of some among you walking disorderly, not working at all, but are busybodies.

<sup>12</sup> But we command and urge such, through our Master יהושע Messiah, to settle down, work and eat their own bread.

<sup>13</sup> And you, brothers, do not grow weary in doing good.

<sup>14</sup> And if anyone does not obey our word in this letter, note that one, and do not keep company with him, so that he is put to shame.

<sup>15</sup> However, do not regard him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.

<sup>16</sup> And the Master of peace Himself give you peace always in every way. The Master be with you all.

<sup>17</sup> The greeting of Sha’ul with my own hand, which is a sign in every letter, thus I write.

<sup>18</sup> The favour of our Master יהושע Messiah be with you all. Amĕn.
