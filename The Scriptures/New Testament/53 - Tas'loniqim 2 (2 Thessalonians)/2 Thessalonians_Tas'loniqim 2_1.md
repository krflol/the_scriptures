<sup>1</sup> Sha’ul, and Sila, and Timothy, to the assembly of the Thessalonians in Elohim our Father and the Master יהושע Messiah:

<sup>2</sup> Favour to you and peace from Elohim our Father and the Master יהושע Messiah.

<sup>3</sup> We ought to give thanks to Elohim always for you, brothers, as it is proper, because your belief grows exceedingly, and the love every one of you has for each other is increasing,

<sup>4</sup> so that we ourselves boast of you among the assemblies of Elohim for your endurance and belief in all your persecutions and afflictions which you are bearing,

<sup>5</sup> clear evidence of the righteous judgment of Elohim, in order for you to be counted worthy of the reign of Elohim, for which you also suffer,

<sup>6</sup> since Elohim shall rightly repay with affliction those who afflict you,

<sup>7</sup> and to give you who are afflicted rest with us when the Master יהושע is revealed from heaven with His mighty messengers,

<sup>8</sup> in flaming fire taking vengeance on those who do not know Elohim, and on those who do not obey the Good News of our Master יהושע Messiah,

<sup>9</sup> who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Master and from the esteem of His strength,

<sup>10</sup> when He comes to be esteemed in His set-apart ones and to be admired among all those who believe in that Day, because our witness to you was believed.

<sup>11</sup> To this end we always pray for you that our Elohim would count you worthy of this calling, and complete all the good pleasure of goodness, and the work of belief with power,

<sup>12</sup> so that the Name of our Master יהושע Messiah is esteemed in you, and you in Him, according to the favour of our Elohim and the Master יהושע Messiah.
