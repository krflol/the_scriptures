<sup>1</sup> If, then, you were raised with Messiah, seek the matters which are above, where Messiah is, seated at the right hand of Elohim.
<sup>2</sup> Mind the matters above, not those on the earth.
<sup>3</sup> For you have died, and your life has been hidden with Messiah in Elohim.
<sup>4</sup> When the Messiah, who is our life, is manifested, then you also shall be manifested with Him in esteem.
<sup>5</sup> Therefore put to death your members which are on the earth: whoring, uncleanness, passion, evil desire and greed of gain, which is idolatry.
<sup>6</sup> Because of these the wrath of Elohim is coming upon the sons of disobedience,
<sup>7</sup> in which you also once walked when you lived in them.
<sup>8</sup> But now, also put off all these: displeasure, wrath, evil, blasphemy, filthy talk from your mouth.
<sup>9</sup> Do not lie to each other, since you have put off the old man with his practices,
<sup>10</sup> and have put on the new one who is renewed in knowledge according to the likeness of Him who created him,
<sup>11</sup> where there is not Greek and Yehuḏite, circumcised and uncircumcised, foreigner, Scythian, slave, free, but Messiah is all, and in all.
<sup>12</sup> Therefore, as chosen ones of Elohim, set-apart and beloved, put on compassion, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, patience,
<sup>13</sup> bearing with one another, and forgiving each other if anyone has a complaint against another, indeed, as Messiah forgave you so also should you.
<sup>14</sup> But above all these put on love, which is a bond of the perfection.
<sup>15</sup> And let the peace of Elohim rule in your hearts, to which indeed you were called in one Body, and be filled with thanks.
<sup>16</sup> Let the Word of Messiah dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing with pleasure in your hearts to the Master in psalms and songs of praise and spiritual songs.
<sup>17</sup> And whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the Name of the Master יהושע, giving thanks to Elohim the Father through Him.
<sup>18</sup> Wives, subject yourselves to your own husbands, as is proper in the Master.
<sup>19</sup> Husbands, love your wives and do not be bitter toward them.
<sup>20</sup> Children, obey your parents in all, for this is well-pleasing to the Master.
<sup>21</sup> Fathers, do not provoke your children, lest they become discouraged.
<sup>22</sup> Servants, obey your masters according to the flesh in all respects, not with eye-service, as men-pleasers, but in sincerity of heart, fearing Elohim.
<sup>23</sup> And whatever you do, do it heartily, as to the Master and not to men,
<sup>24</sup> knowing that from the Master you shall receive the reward of the inheritance. It is the Master, Messiah, you serve.
<sup>25</sup> But he who does wrong shall be repaid for the wrong which he has done, and there is no partiality.
