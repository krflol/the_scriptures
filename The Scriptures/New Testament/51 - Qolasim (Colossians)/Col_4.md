<sup>1</sup> Masters, give your servants what is righteous and fair, knowing that you also have a Master in the heavens.
<sup>2</sup> Continue in prayer, watching therein, with thanksgiving,
<sup>3</sup> praying at the same time also for us, that Elohim would open to us a door for the word, to speak the secret of Messiah, for which I am also in chains,
<sup>4</sup> so that I make it clear, as I should speak.
<sup>5</sup> Walk in wisdom toward those who are outside, redeeming the time.
<sup>6</sup> Let your word always be with favour, seasoned with salt, so that you know how you ought to answer each one.
<sup>7</sup> Tuchikos, who is a beloved brother, a true servant, and a fellow servant in the Master, shall give you all the news about me.
<sup>8</sup> I am sending him to you for this purpose, to know your circumstances and to encourage your hearts,
<sup>9</sup> with Onesimos, a true and beloved brother, who is one of you. They shall let you know all the news here.
<sup>10</sup> Aristarchos my fellow prisoner greets you, with Mark the relative of Barnaḇah about whom you received instructions: if he comes to you, welcome him,
<sup>11</sup> also Yeshua who is called Justus. These are my only fellow workers for the reign of Elohim who are of the circumcision, who were to me a comfort.
<sup>12</sup> Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Messiah, greets you, always wrestling for you in prayers, so that you stand perfect and complete in all the desire of Elohim.
<sup>13</sup> For I bear him witness that he has a deep concern for you, and for those who are in Laodikeia and those in Hierapolis.
<sup>14</sup> Luke the beloved physician and Demas greet you.
<sup>15</sup> Greet the brothers in Laodikeia, and Numpha and the assembly that is in his house.
<sup>16</sup> And when this letter is read among you, see that it is read also in the assembly of the Laodikeians, and that you likewise read the letter from Laodikeia.
<sup>17</sup> And say to Archippos, “See to the service which you have received in the Master, so that you complete it.”
<sup>18</sup> This greeting is in my own hand – Sha’ul. Remember my chains. Favour be with you. Amĕn.
