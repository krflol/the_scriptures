<sup>1</sup> In the same way, wives, be subject to your own husbands, so that if any are disobedient to the Word, they, without a word, might be won by the behaviour of their wives,

<sup>2</sup> having seen your blameless behaviour in fear.

<sup>3</sup> Your adornment should not be outward – arranging the hair, wearing gold, or putting on dresses –

<sup>4</sup> but the hidden Man of the heart, with the incorruptible ornament of a meek and peaceable spirit, which is of great value before Elohim.

<sup>5</sup> For in this way, in former times, the set-apart women who trusted in Elohim also adorned themselves, being subject to their own husbands,

<sup>6</sup> as Sarah obeyed Aḇraham, calling him master, of whom you became children, doing good, and not frightened by any fear.

<sup>7</sup> In the same way, husbands, live understandingly together, giving respect to the wife, as to the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the favour of life, so that your prayers are not hindered.

<sup>8</sup> To sum up, let all of you be like-minded, sympathetic, loving as brothers, tenderhearted, humble-minded,

<sup>9</sup> not returning evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary blessing, knowing that you were called to this, in order to inherit a blessing.

<sup>10</sup> For “He who wishes to love life and see good days, let him keep his tongue from evil, and his lips from speaking deceit,

<sup>11</sup> let him turn away from evil and do good, let him seek peace and pursue it.

<sup>12</sup> “Because the eyes of יהוה are on the righteous, and his ears are open to their prayers, but the face of יהוה is against those who do evil.”

<sup>13</sup> And who is the one doing evil to you, if you become imitators of the good?

<sup>14</sup> But even if you suffer for righteousness’ sake, you are blessed. “And do not fear their threats, neither be troubled.”

<sup>15</sup> But set apart יהוה Elohim in your hearts, and always be ready to give an answer to everyone asking you a reason concerning the expectation that is in you, with meekness and fear,

<sup>16</sup> having a good conscience, so that when they speak against you as doers of evil, those who falsely accuse your good behaviour in Messiah, shall be ashamed.

<sup>17</sup> For it is better, if it is the desire of Elohim, to suffer for doing good than for doing evil.

<sup>18</sup> Because even Messiah once suffered for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring you to Elohim, having been put to death indeed in flesh but made alive in the Spirit,

<sup>19</sup> in which also He went and proclaimed unto the spirits in prison,

<sup>20</sup> who were disobedient at one time when the patience of Elohim waited in the days of Noaḥ, while the ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is, eight beings, were saved through water,

<sup>21</sup> which figure now also saves us: immersion – not a putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward Elohim – through the resurrection of יהושע Messiah,

<sup>22</sup> who, having gone into heaven, is at the right hand of Elohim, messengers and authorities and powers having been subjected to Him.
