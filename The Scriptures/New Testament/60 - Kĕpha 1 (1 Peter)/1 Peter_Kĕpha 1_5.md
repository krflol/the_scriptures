<sup>1</sup> Therefore, as a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Messiah, and also a sharer of the esteem that is to be revealed, I appeal to the elders among you:

<sup>2</sup> Shepherd the flock of Elohim which is among you, serving as overseers, not by compulsion but voluntarily, not out of greed for filthy gain, but eagerly,

<sup>3</sup> neither as being masters over those entrusted to you, but being examples to the flock.

<sup>4</sup> And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you shall receive the never-fading crown of esteem.

<sup>5</sup> In the same way, you younger ones, be subject to elders. And gird yourselves with humility toward one another, for “Elohim resists the proud, but gives favour to the humble.”

<sup>6</sup> Humble yourselves, then, under the mighty hand of Elohim, so that He exalts you in due time,

<sup>7</sup> casting all your worry upon Him, for He is concerned about you.

<sup>8</sup> Be sober, watch, because your adversary the devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.

<sup>9</sup> Resist him, firm in the belief, knowing that the same hardships are experienced by your brotherhood in the world.

<sup>10</sup> And the Elohim of all favour, who called you to His everlasting esteem by Messiah יהושע, after you have suffered a while, Himself perfect, establish, strengthen, and settle you.

<sup>11</sup> To Him be the esteem and the might forever and ever. Amĕn.

<sup>12</sup> Through Sila the trustworthy brother, as I reckon, I have written to you briefly, encouraging and witnessing that this is the true favour of Elohim. In this stand fast.

<sup>13</sup> She who is in Baḇel, chosen together with you, greets you, also my son, Mark.

<sup>14</sup> Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace to all of you who are in Messiah יהושע. Amĕn.
