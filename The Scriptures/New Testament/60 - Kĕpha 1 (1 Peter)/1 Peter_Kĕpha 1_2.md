<sup>1</sup> Having put aside, then, all evil, and all deceit, and hypocrisies, and envyings, and all evil words,

<sup>2</sup> as newborn babes, desire the unadulterated milk of the Word, in order that you grow by it,

<sup>3</sup> if indeed you have tasted that the Master is good.

<sup>4</sup> Drawing near to Him, a living Stone – rejected indeed by men, but chosen by Elohim and precious –

<sup>5</sup> you also, as living stones, are being built up, a spiritual house, a set-apart priesthood, to offer up spiritual slaughter offerings acceptable to Elohim through יהושע Messiah.

<sup>6</sup> Because it is contained in the Scripture, “See, I lay in Tsiyon a chief corner-stone, chosen, precious, and he who believes on Him shall by no means be put to shame.”

<sup>7</sup> This preciousness, then, is for you who believe; but to those who are disobedient, “The stone which the builders rejected has become the chief corner-stone,”

<sup>8</sup> and “A stone of stumbling and a rock that makes for falling,” who stumble because they are disobedient to the Word, to which they also were appointed.

<sup>9</sup> But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a set-apart nation, a people for a possession, that you should proclaim the praises of Him who called you out of darkness into His marvellous light,

<sup>10</sup> who once were not a people, but now the people of Elohim; who had not obtained compassion, but now obtained compassion.

<sup>11</sup> Beloved ones, I appeal to you as sojourners and pilgrims, to abstain from fleshly lusts which battle against the life,

<sup>12</sup> having your behaviour among the gentiles good so that when they speak against you as evil-doers, let them, by observing your good works, esteem Elohim in a day of visitation.

<sup>13</sup> Be subject to every institution of man because of the Master, whether to the sovereign as supreme,

<sup>14</sup> or to governors, as to those who are sent by him for the punishment of doers of evil, and a praise for those who do good.

<sup>15</sup> Because such is the desire of Elohim, that by doing good you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish men,

<sup>16</sup> as free, yet not using your freedom as a cloak for evil, but as servants of Elohim.

<sup>17</sup> Respect all, love the brotherhood, fear Elohim, respect the sovereign.

<sup>18</sup> Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the crooked ones.

<sup>19</sup> For this is favour, if because of conscience toward Elohim anyone bears up under grief, suffering unrighteously.

<sup>20</sup> For what credit is there in enduring a beating when you sin? But if you suffer for doing good and you endure, this finds favour with Elohim.

<sup>21</sup> For to this you were called, because Messiah also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that you should follow His steps,

<sup>22</sup> “who committed no sin, nor was deceit found in His mouth,”

<sup>23</sup> who, being reviled, did not revile in return; suffering, did not threaten, but committed Himself to Him who judges righteously;

<sup>24</sup> who Himself bore our sins in His body on the timber, so that we, having died to sins, might live unto righteousness – by whose stripes you were healed.

<sup>25</sup> For you were like sheep going astray, but have now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your lives.
