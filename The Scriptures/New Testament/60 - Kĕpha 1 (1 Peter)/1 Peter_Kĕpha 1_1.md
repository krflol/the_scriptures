<sup>1</sup> Kĕpha, an emissary of יהושע Messiah, to the chosen, strangers of the dispersion in Pontos, Galatia, Kappadokia, Asia, and Bithunia,

<sup>2</sup> chosen according to the foreknowledge of Elohim the Father, set apart by the Spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of יהושע Messiah: Favour and peace be increased to you.

<sup>3</sup> Blessed be the Elohim and Father of our Master יהושע Messiah, who according to His great compassion has caused us to be born again to a living expectation through the resurrection of יהושע Messiah from the dead,

<sup>4</sup> to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and unfading, having been kept in the heavens for you,

<sup>5</sup> who are protected by the power of Elohim through belief, for a deliverance ready to be revealed in the last time,

<sup>6</sup> in which you exult, even though for a little while, if need be, you have been grieved by manifold trials,

<sup>7</sup> in order that the proving of your belief – much more precious than gold that perishes, and proven by fire – might be found to result in praise and respect and esteem at the revelation of יהושע Messiah,

<sup>8</sup> whom having not seen, you love; in whom you exult with unspeakable and esteemed joy, yet not seeing, but believing,

<sup>9</sup> obtaining the goal of your belief: a deliverance of lives.

<sup>10</sup> Concerning this deliverance the prophets have sought out and searched out, prophesying concerning the favour for you,

<sup>11</sup> searching to know what, or what sort of time, the Spirit which was in them was pointing out concerning Messiah, when it was bearing witness beforehand the sufferings of Messiah, and the esteems that would follow,

<sup>12</sup> to whom it was revealed that they were serving, not themselves, but you, in these matters which now have been announced to you through those who brought the Good News to you by the Set-apart Spirit sent from heaven – into which messengers long to look into.

<sup>13</sup> Therefore, having girded up the loins of your mind, being sober, set your expectation perfectly upon the favour that is to be brought to you at the revelation of יהושע Messiah,

<sup>14</sup> as obedient children, not conforming yourselves to the former lusts in your ignorance,

<sup>15</sup> instead, as the One who called you is set-apart, so you also should become set-apart in all behaviour,

<sup>16</sup> because it has been written, “Be set-apart, for I am set-apart.”

<sup>17</sup> And if you call on the Father, who without partiality judges according to each one’s work, pass the time of your sojourning in fear,

<sup>18</sup> knowing that you were redeemed from your futile way of life inherited from your fathers, not with what is corruptible, silver or gold,

<sup>19</sup> but with the precious blood of Messiah, as of a lamb unblemished and spotless,

<sup>20</sup> foreknown, indeed, before the foundation of the world, but manifested in these last times for your sakes,

<sup>21</sup> who through Him believe in Elohim who raised Him from the dead and gave Him esteem, so that your belief and expectation are in Elohim.

<sup>22</sup> Now that you have cleansed your lives in obeying the truth through the Spirit to unfeigned brotherly love, love one another fervently with a clean heart,

<sup>23</sup> having been born again – not of corruptible seed, but incorruptible – through the living Word of Elohim, which remains forever,

<sup>24</sup> because “All flesh is as grass, and all the esteem of man as the flower of the grass. The grass withers, and its flower falls away,

<sup>25</sup> but the Word of Elohim remains forever.” And this is the Word, announced as Good News to you.
