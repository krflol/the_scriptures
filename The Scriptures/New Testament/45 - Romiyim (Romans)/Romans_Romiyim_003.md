<sup>1</sup> What then is the advantage of the Yehuḏite, or what is the value of the circumcision?

<sup>2</sup> Much in every way! Because firstly indeed, that they were entrusted with the Words of Elohim.

<sup>3</sup> For what if some did not believe? Shall their unbelief nullify the trustworthiness of Elohim?

<sup>4</sup> Let it not be! But let Elohim be true, and every man a liar, as it has been written, “That You should be declared right in Your words, and prevail in Your judging.”

<sup>5</sup> But if our unrighteousness establishes the righteousness of Elohim, what shall we say? Is Elohim unrighteous who is inflicting wrath? I speak as a man.

<sup>6</sup> Let it not be! Otherwise how shall Elohim judge the world?

<sup>7</sup> For if the truth of Elohim has increased through my lie, to His esteem, why am I also still judged as a sinner?

<sup>8</sup> And why not say, “Let us do evil so that the good might come”? – as we are wrongly accused and as some claim that we say. Their judgment is in the right.

<sup>9</sup> What then? Are we better than they? Not at all, for we have previously accused both Yehuḏim and Greeks that they are all under sin.

<sup>10</sup> As it has been written, “There is none righteous, no, not one!

<sup>11</sup> “There is no one who is understanding, there is none who is seeking Elohim.

<sup>12</sup> “They all have turned aside, they have together become worthless. There is none who does good, no, not one.”

<sup>13</sup> “Their throat is an open tomb, with their tongues they have deceived,” “The poison of adders is under their lips,”

<sup>14</sup> “Whose mouth is filled with cursing and bitterness.”

<sup>15</sup> “Their feet are swift to shed blood,

<sup>16</sup> ruin and wretchedness are in their ways,

<sup>17</sup> and the way of peace they have not known.”

<sup>18</sup> “There is no fear of Elohim before their eyes.”

<sup>19</sup> And we know that whatever the Torah says, it says to those who are in the Torah, so that every mouth might be stopped, and all the world come under judgment before Elohim.

<sup>20</sup> Therefore by works of Torah no flesh shall be declared right before Him, for by the Torah is the knowledge of sin.

<sup>21</sup> But now, apart from the Torah, a righteousness of Elohim has been revealed, being witnessed by the Torah and the Prophets,

<sup>22</sup> and the righteousness of Elohim is through belief in יהושע Messiah to all and on all who believe. For there is no difference,

<sup>23</sup> for all have sinned and fall short of the esteem of Elohim,

<sup>24</sup> being declared right, without paying, by His favour through the redemption which is in Messiah יהושע,

<sup>25</sup> whom Elohim set forth as an atonement, through belief in His blood, to demonstrate His righteousness, because in His tolerance Elohim had passed over the sins that had taken place before,

<sup>26</sup> to demonstrate at the present time His righteousness, that He is righteous and declares righteous the one who has belief in יהושע.

<sup>27</sup> Where, then, is the boasting? It is shut out. By what Torah? Of works? No, but by the Torah of belief.

<sup>28</sup> For we reckon that a man is declared right by belief without works of Torah.

<sup>29</sup> Or is He the Elohim of the Yehuḏim only, and not also of the gentiles? Yea, of the gentiles also,

<sup>30</sup> since it is one Elohim who shall declare right the circumcised by belief and the uncircumcised through belief.

<sup>31</sup> Do we then nullify the Torah through the belief? Let it not be! On the contrary, we establish the Torah.
