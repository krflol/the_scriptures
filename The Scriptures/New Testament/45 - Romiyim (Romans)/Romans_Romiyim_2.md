<sup>1</sup> Therefore, O man, you are without excuse, everyone who judges, for in which you judge another you condemn yourself, since you who judge practise the same wrongs.

<sup>2</sup> And we know that the judgment of Elohim is according to truth against those who practise such wrongs.

<sup>3</sup> And do you think, O man, you who judge those practising such wrongs, and doing the same, that you shall escape the judgment of Elohim?

<sup>4</sup> Or do you despise the riches of His kindness, and tolerance, and patience, not knowing that the kindness of Elohim leads you to repentance?

<sup>5</sup> But according to your hardness and your unrepentant heart you are treasuring up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of Elohim,

<sup>6</sup> who “shall render to each one according to his works”:

<sup>7</sup> everlasting life to those who by persistence in good work seek for esteem, and respect, and incorruptibility;

<sup>8</sup> but wrath and displeasure to those who are self-seeking and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness;

<sup>9</sup> affliction and distress on every human being working what is evil, of the Yehuḏite first, and also of the Greek;

<sup>10</sup> but esteem, respect, and peace to everyone working what is good, to the Yehuḏite first and also to the Greek.

<sup>11</sup> For there is no partiality with Elohim.

<sup>12</sup> For as many as sinned without Torah shall also perish without Torah, and as many as sinned in the Torah shall be judged by the Torah.

<sup>13</sup> For not the hearers of the Torah are righteous in the sight of Elohim, but the doers of the law shall be declared right.

<sup>14</sup> For when gentiles, who do not have the Torah, by nature do what is in the Torah, although not having the Torah, they are a Torah to themselves,

<sup>15</sup> who show the work of the Torah written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and between themselves their thoughts accusing or even excusing,

<sup>16</sup> in the day when Elohim shall judge the secrets of men through יהושע Messiah, according to my Good News.

<sup>17</sup> See, you are called a Yehuḏite, and rest on the Torah, and make your boast in Elohim,

<sup>18</sup> and know the desire of Elohim, and approve what is superior, being instructed out of the Torah,

<sup>19</sup> and are trusting that you yourself are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,

<sup>20</sup> an instructor of foolish ones, a teacher of babes, having the form of knowledge and of the truth in the Torah.

<sup>21</sup> You, then, who teach another, do you not teach yourself? You who proclaim that a man should not steal, do you steal?

<sup>22</sup> You who say, “Do not commit adultery,” do you commit adultery? You who abominate idols, do you rob temples?

<sup>23</sup> You who make your boast in the Torah, through the transgression of the Torah do you disrespect Elohim?

<sup>24</sup> For “The Name of Elohim is blasphemed among the gentiles because of you,” as it has been written.

<sup>25</sup> For circumcision indeed profits if you practise the Torah, but if you are a transgressor of the Torah, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.

<sup>26</sup> So, if an uncircumcised one watches over the righteousnesses of the Torah, shall not his uncircumcision be reckoned as circumcision?

<sup>27</sup> And the uncircumcised by nature, who perfects the Torah, shall judge you who notwithstanding letter and circumcision are a transgressor of the Torah!

<sup>28</sup> For he is not a Yehuḏite who is so outwardly, neither is circumcision that which is outward in the flesh.

<sup>29</sup> But a Yehuḏite is he who is so inwardly, and circumcision is that of the heart, in Spirit, not literally, whose praise is not from men but from Elohim.
