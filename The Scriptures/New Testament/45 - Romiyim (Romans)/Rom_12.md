<sup>1</sup> I call upon you, therefore, brothers, through the compassion of Elohim, to present your bodies a living offering – set-apart, well-pleasing to Elohim – your reasonable worship.
<sup>2</sup> And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you prove what is that good and well-pleasing and perfect desire of Elohim.
<sup>3</sup> For I say, through the favour which has been given to me, to everyone who is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he should think, but to think soberly, as Elohim has given to each a measure of belief.
<sup>4</sup> For as we have many members in one body, but all members do not have the same function,
<sup>5</sup> so we, the many, are one body in Messiah, and members each one of one another.
<sup>6</sup> Now having different gifts, according to the favour which was given to us, let us use them accordingly: if prophecy, according to the proportion of belief;
<sup>7</sup> if serving, in the serving; or he who is teaching, in the teaching;
<sup>8</sup> or he who encourages, in the encouragement; or he who is sharing, in sincerity; he who is leading, in diligence; he who shows compassion, joyously.
<sup>9</sup> Let love be without hypocrisy. Shrink from what is wicked, cling to what is good.
<sup>10</sup> In brotherly love, tenderly loving towards one another, in appreciation, giving preference to each other;
<sup>11</sup> not idle in duty, ardent in spirit, serving the Master;
<sup>12</sup> rejoicing in the expectancy, enduring under pressure, continuing steadfastly in prayer;
<sup>13</sup> imparting to the needs of the set-apart ones, pursuing kindness towards strangers.
<sup>14</sup> Bless those who persecute you – bless and do not curse.
<sup>15</sup> Rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep.
<sup>16</sup> Be of the same mind toward one another. Do not be proud in mind, but go along with the lowly. Do not be wise in your own estimation.
<sup>17</sup> Repay no one evil for evil. Respect what is right in the sight of all men.
<sup>18</sup> If possible, on your part, be at peace with all men.
<sup>19</sup> Beloved, do not revenge yourselves, but give place to the wrath, for it has been written, “Vengeance is Mine, I shall repay,” says יהוה.
<sup>20</sup> “Instead, if your enemy hungers, feed him; if he thirsts, give him a drink, for in so doing you shall heap coals of fire on his head.”
<sup>21</sup> Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.
