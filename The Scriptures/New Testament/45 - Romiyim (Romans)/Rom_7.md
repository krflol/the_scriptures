<sup>1</sup> Or do you not know, brothers – for I speak to those knowing the Torah – that the Torah rules over a man as long as he lives?
<sup>2</sup> For the married woman has been bound by Torah to the living husband, but if the husband dies, she is released from the Torah concerning her husband.
<sup>3</sup> So then, while her husband lives, she shall be called an adulteress if she becomes another man’s. But if her husband dies, she is free from that part of the Torah, so that she is not an adulteress, having become another man’s.
<sup>4</sup> So my brothers, you also were put to death to the Torah through the body of Messiah, for you to become another’s, the One who was raised from the dead, that we should bear fruit to Elohim.
<sup>5</sup> For when we were in the flesh, the passions of sins, through the Torah, were working in our members to bear fruit to death.
<sup>6</sup> But now we have been released from the Torah, having died to what we were held by, so that we should serve in newness of Spirit and not in oldness of letter.
<sup>7</sup> What, then, shall we say? Is the Torah sin? Let it not be! However, I did not know sin except through the Torah. For also the covetousness I knew not if the Torah had not said, “You shall not covet.”
<sup>8</sup> But sin, having taken the occasion through the command, did work in me all sorts of covetousness. For apart from Torah sin is dead.
<sup>9</sup> And I was alive apart from the Torah once, but when the command came, the sin revived, and I died.
<sup>10</sup> And the command which was to result in life, this I found to result in death.
<sup>11</sup> For sin, having taken the occasion through the command, deceived me, and through it killed me.
<sup>12</sup> So that the Torah truly is set-apart, and the command set-apart, and righteous, and good.
<sup>13</sup> Therefore, has that which is good become death to me? Let it not be! But the sin, that sin might be manifest, was working death in me through what is good, so that sin through the command might become an exceedingly great Sinner.
<sup>14</sup> For we know that the Torah is Spiritual, but I am fleshly, sold under sin.
<sup>15</sup> For what I work, I know not. For what I wish, that I do not practise, but what I hate, that I do.
<sup>16</sup> But if I do what I do not wish, I agree with the Torah that it is good.
<sup>17</sup> And now, it is no longer I that work it, but the sin dwelling in me.
<sup>18</sup> For I know that in me, that is in my flesh, dwells no good. For to wish is present with me, but to work the good I do not find.
<sup>19</sup> For the good that I wish to do, I do not do; but the evil I do not wish to do, this I practise.
<sup>20</sup> And if I do that which I do not wish, it is no longer I who work it, but the sin dwelling in me.
<sup>21</sup> I find therefore this law, that when I wish to do the good, that the evil is present with me.
<sup>22</sup> For I delight in the Torah of Elohim according to the inward man,
<sup>23</sup> but I see another law in my members, battling against the Torah of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.
<sup>24</sup> Wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me from this body of death?
<sup>25</sup> Thanks to Elohim, through יהושע Messiah our Master! So then, with the mind I myself truly serve the Torah of Elohim, but with the flesh the law of sin.
