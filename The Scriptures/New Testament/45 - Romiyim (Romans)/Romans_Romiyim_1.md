<sup>1</sup> Sha’ul, a servant of יהושע Messiah, a called emissary, separated to the Good News of Elohim,

<sup>2</sup> which He promised before through His prophets in the Set-apart Scriptures,

<sup>3</sup> concerning His Son, who came of the seed of Dawiḏ according to the flesh,

<sup>4</sup> who was designated Son of Elohim with power, according to the Set-apart Spirit, by the resurrection from the dead: יהושע Messiah, the Master of us,

<sup>5</sup> through whom we have received favour and office of the emissary for belief-obedience among all the nations on behalf of His Name,

<sup>6</sup> among whom you also are the called ones of יהושע Messiah.

<sup>7</sup> To all who are in Rome, beloved of Elohim, called, set-apart ones: Favour to you and peace from Elohim our Father and the Master יהושע Messiah.

<sup>8</sup> First, I truly thank my Elohim through יהושע Messiah for you all, that your belief is spoken of in all the world.

<sup>9</sup> For Elohim is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the Good News of His Son, how unceasingly I make mention of you,

<sup>10</sup> always asking in my prayers, if at all possible, I shall be blessed by the desire of Elohim, to come to you.

<sup>11</sup> For I long to see you, so as to impart some spiritual gift to you, for you to be established,

<sup>12</sup> and that is, to be encouraged together among you, each by the other’s belief – both yours and mine.

<sup>13</sup> And I do not wish you to be unaware, brothers, that I often purposed to come to you, but was hindered until now, in order to have some fruit among you, as also among the other gentiles.

<sup>14</sup> I am a debtor both to Greeks and to foreigners, both to wise and to foolish.

<sup>15</sup> That is why I am so eager to bring the Good News also to you who are in Rome.

<sup>16</sup> For I am not ashamed of the Good News of Messiah, for it is the power of Elohim for deliverance to everyone who believes, to the Yehuḏite first and also to the Greek.

<sup>17</sup> For in it the righteousness of Elohim is revealed from belief to belief, as it has been written, “But the righteous shall live by belief.”

<sup>18</sup> For the wrath of Elohim is revealed from heaven against all wickedness and unrighteousness of men, who suppress the truth in unrighteousness,

<sup>19</sup> because that which is known of Elohim is manifest among them, for Elohim has manifested it to them.

<sup>20</sup> For since the creation of the world His invisible qualities have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, both His everlasting power and Mightiness, for them to be without excuse,

<sup>21</sup> because, although they knew Elohim, they did not esteem Him as Elohim, nor gave thanks, but became vain in their reasonings, and their undiscerning heart was darkened.

<sup>22</sup> Claiming to be wise, they became fools,

<sup>23</sup> and changed the esteem of the incorruptible Elohim into the likeness of an image of corruptible man, and of birds and of four-footed beasts and of reptiles.

<sup>24</sup> Therefore Elohim gave them up to uncleanness in the lust of their hearts, to disrespect their bodies among themselves,

<sup>25</sup> who changed the truth of Elohim into the falsehood, and worshipped and served what was created rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amĕn.

<sup>26</sup> Because of this Elohim gave them over to degrading passions. For even their women exchanged natural relations for what is against nature,

<sup>27</sup> and likewise, the men also, having left natural relations with woman, burned in their lust for one another, men with men committing indecency, and receiving back the reward which was due for their straying.

<sup>28</sup> And even as they did not think it worth- while to possess the knowledge of Elohim, Elohim gave them over to a worthless mind, to do what is improper,

<sup>29</sup> having been filled with all unrighteousness, whoring, wickedness, greed, evil; filled with envy, murder, fighting, deceit, evil habits; whisperers,

<sup>30</sup> slanderers, haters of Elohim, insolent, proud, boasters, devisers of evils, disobedient to parents,

<sup>31</sup> without discernment, covenant breakers, unloving, unforgiving, ruthless;

<sup>32</sup> who, though they know the righteousness of Elohim, that those who practise such deserve death, not only do the same but also approve of those who practise them.
