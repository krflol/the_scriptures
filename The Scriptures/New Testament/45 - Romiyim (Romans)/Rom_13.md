<sup>1</sup> Let every being be in subjection to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from Elohim, and the authorities that exist are appointed by Elohim.
<sup>2</sup> So he who opposes the authority withstands the institution of Elohim, and those who withstand shall bring judgment on themselves.
<sup>3</sup> For those ruling are an object of fear, not to good works, but to evil. Do you wish to be not afraid of the authority? Do the good, and you shall have praise from it,
<sup>4</sup> for it is a servant of Elohim to you for good. But if you do evil, be afraid, for it does not bear the sword in vain. For it is a servant of Elohim, a revenger to execute wrath on him who practises evil.
<sup>5</sup> Therefore, it is necessary to be subject, not only because of wrath but also because of the conscience.
<sup>6</sup> For because of this you also pay taxes, for they are servants of Elohim attending continually to these duties.
<sup>7</sup> Render therefore to all what is due to them: tax to whom tax is due, toll to whom toll, fear to whom fear, respect to whom respect.
<sup>8</sup> Owe no one any matter except to love one another, for he who loves another has filled the Torah.
<sup>9</sup> For this, “You shall not commit adultery,” “You shall not murder,” “You shall not steal,” “You shall not bear false witness,” “You shall not covet,” and if there is any other command, is summed up in this word, “You shall love your neighbour as yourself.”
<sup>10</sup> Love does no evil to a neighbour. Therefore, love is completion of the Torah.
<sup>11</sup> And do this, knowing the time, that it is already the hour for us to wake up from sleep, for now our deliverance is nearer than when we did believe.
<sup>12</sup> The night is far advanced, the day has come near. So let us put off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.
<sup>13</sup> Let us walk becomingly, as in the day, not in wild parties and drunkenness, not in living together and indecencies, not in fighting and envy,
<sup>14</sup> but put on the Master יהושע Messiah, and make no provision for the lusts of the flesh.
