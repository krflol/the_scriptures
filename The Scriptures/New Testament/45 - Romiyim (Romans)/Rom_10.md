<sup>1</sup> Truly brothers, my heart’s desire and prayer to Elohim for Yisra’ĕl is for deliverance.
<sup>2</sup> For I bear them witness that they have an ardour for Elohim, but not according to knowledge.
<sup>3</sup> For not knowing the righteousness of Elohim, and seeking to establish their own righteousness, they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of Elohim.
<sup>4</sup> For Messiah is the goal of the ‘Torah unto righteousness’to everyone who believes.
<sup>5</sup> For Mosheh writes about the righteousness which is of the Torah, “The man who does these shall live by them.”
<sup>6</sup> But the righteousness of belief speaks in this way, “Do not say in your heart, ‘Who shall ascend into the heavens?’ ” – that is, to bring Messiah down; or,
<sup>7</sup> “ ‘Who shall descend into the abyss?’ ” – that is, to bring Messiah up from the dead.
<sup>8</sup> But what does it say? “The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart” – that is, the word of belief which we are proclaiming:
<sup>9</sup> That if you confess with your mouth the Master יהושע and believe in your heart that Elohim has raised Him from the dead, you shall be saved.
<sup>10</sup> For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and one confesses with the mouth, and so is saved.
<sup>11</sup> Because the Scripture says, “Whoever puts his trust in Him shall not be put to shame.”
<sup>12</sup> Because there is no distinction between Yehuḏite and Greek, for the same Master of all is rich to all those calling upon Him.
<sup>13</sup> For “everyone who calls on the Name of יהוה shall be saved.”
<sup>14</sup> How then shall they call on Him in whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without one proclaiming?
<sup>15</sup> And how shall they proclaim if they are not sent? As it has been written, “How pleasant are the feet of those who bring the Good News of peace, who bring the Good News of the good!”
<sup>16</sup> However, not all obeyed the Good News. For Yeshayahu says, “ יהוה, who has believed our report?”
<sup>17</sup> So then belief comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of Elohim.
<sup>18</sup> But I ask, Did they not hear? Yea indeed, “Their voice went out to all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world.”
<sup>19</sup> But I ask, Did Yisra’ĕl not know? First Mosheh says, “I shall provoke you to jealousy by those who are not a nation, I shall enrage you by an unwise nation.”
<sup>20</sup> And Yeshayahu boldly says, “I was found by those not seeking Me, I was made manifest to those not asking for Me.”
<sup>21</sup> And to Yisra’ĕl He says, “All day long I have stretched out My hands to a disobedient and back-talking people.”
