<sup>1</sup> I speak the truth in Messiah, I do not lie, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Set-apart Spirit,
<sup>2</sup> that I have great sadness and continual grief in my heart.
<sup>3</sup> For I myself could have wished to be banished from Messiah for the sake of my brothers, my relatives according to the flesh,
<sup>4</sup> who are Yisra’ĕlites, whose is the adoption, and the esteem, and the covenants, and the giving of the Torah, and the worship, and the promises,
<sup>5</sup> whose are the fathers, and from whom is the Messiah according to the flesh, who is over all, Elohim-blessed forever. Amĕn.
<sup>6</sup> However, it is not as though the word of Elohim has failed. For they are not all Yisra’ĕl who are of Yisra’ĕl,
<sup>7</sup> neither are they all children because they are the seed of Aḇraham, but, “In Yitsḥaq your seed shall be called.”
<sup>8</sup> That is, those who are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of Elohim, but the children of the promise are reckoned as the seed.
<sup>9</sup> For this is the word of promise, “At this time I shall come and Sarah shall have a son.”
<sup>10</sup> And not only so, but Riḇqah having conceived by one, our father Yitsḥaq.
<sup>11</sup> Yet, before they were born or had done any good or evil – in order that the purpose of Elohim, according to choice, might stand, not of works but of Him who calls –
<sup>12</sup> it was said to her, “The greater shall serve the lesser,”
<sup>13</sup> as it has been written, “Ya‛aqoḇ I have loved, but Ĕsaw I have hated.”
<sup>14</sup> What, then, shall we say? Is there unrighteousness with Elohim? Let it not be!
<sup>15</sup> For He says to Mosheh, “I shall favour whomever I favour, and I shall have compassion on whomever I have compassion.”
<sup>16</sup> So, then, it is not of him who is wishing, nor of him who is running, but of Elohim who shows favour.
<sup>17</sup> For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, “For this same purpose I have raised you up, to show My power in you, and that My Name be declared in all the earth.”
<sup>18</sup> So, then, He favours whom He wishes, and He hardens whom He wishes.
<sup>19</sup> Then you shall say to me, “Why does He still find fault? For who has resisted His counsel?”
<sup>20</sup> But who are you, O man, to talk back to Elohim? Shall that which is formed say to him who formed it, “Why have you made me like this?”
<sup>21</sup> Does not the potter have authority over the clay, from the same lump to make one vessel for value and another not for value?
<sup>22</sup> And if Elohim, desiring to show wrath, and to make His power known, with much patience tolerated the vessels of wrath prepared for destruction,
<sup>23</sup> and that He might make known the riches of His esteem on vessels of compassion, which He had prepared beforehand for esteem,
<sup>24</sup> even whom He called, not only us of the Yehuḏim, but also of the gentiles?
<sup>25</sup> As He says in Hoshĕa too, “I shall call them My people, who were not My people, and her beloved, who was not beloved.”
<sup>26</sup> “And it shall be in the place where it was said to them, ‘You are not My people,’ there they shall be called sons of the living Elohim.”
<sup>27</sup> And Yeshayahu cries out on behalf of Yisra’ĕl, “Though the number of the children of Yisra’ĕl be as the sand of the sea, the remnant shall be saved.
<sup>28</sup> For He is bringing a matter to an end, and is cutting it short in righteousness, because יהוה shall cut short a matter on the earth.”
<sup>29</sup> And as Yeshayahu said before, “If יהוה of hosts had not left us a seed, we would have become like Seḏom, and we would have been made like Amorah.”
<sup>30</sup> What shall we say then? That gentiles not following after righteousness, have obtained righteousness, even the righteousness of belief,
<sup>31</sup> but Yisra’ĕl following after the Torah of righteousness, has not arrived at the Torah of righteousness.
<sup>32</sup> Why? Because it was not of belief, but as by works of Torah. For they stumbled at the Stone of stumbling.
<sup>33</sup> As it has been written, “See, I lay in Tsiyon a Stone of stumbling and a Rock that makes for falling, and everyone who is believing on Him shall not be put to shame.”
