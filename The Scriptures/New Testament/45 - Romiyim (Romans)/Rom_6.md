<sup>1</sup> What, then, shall we say? Shall we continue in sin, to let favour increase?
<sup>2</sup> Let it not be! How shall we who died to sin still live in it?
<sup>3</sup> Or do you not know that as many of us as were immersed into Messiah יהושע were immersed into His death?
<sup>4</sup> We were therefore buried with Him through immersion into death, that as Messiah was raised from the dead by the esteem of the Father, so also we should walk in newness of life.
<sup>5</sup> For if we have come to be grown together in the likeness of His death, we shall be also of the resurrection,
<sup>6</sup> knowing this, that our old man was impaled with Him, so that the body of sin might be rendered powerless, to serve sin no longer.
<sup>7</sup> For he who has died has been made right from sin.
<sup>8</sup> And if we died with Messiah, we believe that we shall also live with Him,
<sup>9</sup> knowing that Messiah, having been raised from the dead, dies no more – death no longer rules over Him.
<sup>10</sup> For in that He died, He died to sin once for all; but in that He lives, He lives to Elohim.
<sup>11</sup> So you also, reckon yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to Elohim in Messiah יהושע our Master.
<sup>12</sup> Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body, to obey it in its desires,
<sup>13</sup> neither present your members as instruments of unrighteousness to sin, but present yourselves to Elohim as being alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to Elohim.
<sup>14</sup> For sin shall not rule over you, for you are not under the law but under favour.
<sup>15</sup> What then? Shall we sin because we are not under Torah but under favour? Let it not be!
<sup>16</sup> Do you not know that to whom you present yourselves servants for obedience, you are servants of the one whom you obey, whether of sin to death, or of obedience to righteousness?
<sup>17</sup> But thanks to Elohim that you were servants of sin, yet you obeyed from the heart that form of teaching to which you were entrusted.
<sup>18</sup> And having been set free from sin, you became servants of righteousness.
<sup>19</sup> I speak as a man, because of the weakness of your flesh. For even as you did present your members as servants of uncleanness, and of lawlessness resulting in lawlessness, so now present your members as servants of righteousness resulting in set-apartness.
<sup>20</sup> For when you were servants of sin, you were free from righteousness.
<sup>21</sup> What fruit, therefore, were you having then, over which you are now ashamed? For the end thereof is death.
<sup>22</sup> But now, having been set free from sin, and having become servants of Elohim, you have your fruit resulting in set-apartness, and the end, everlasting life.
<sup>23</sup> For the wages of sin is death, but the favourable gift of Elohim is everlasting life in Messiah יהושע our Master.
