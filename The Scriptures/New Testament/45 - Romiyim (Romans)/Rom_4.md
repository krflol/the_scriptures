<sup>1</sup> What, then, shall we say Aḇraham our father, to have found, according to the flesh?
<sup>2</sup> For if Aḇraham was declared right by works, he has ground for boasting, but not before Elohim.
<sup>3</sup> For what does the Scripture say? “Aḇraham believed Elohim, and it was reckoned to him for righteousness.”
<sup>4</sup> And to him who is working, the reward is not reckoned as a favour but as a debt.
<sup>5</sup> And to him who is not working but believes on Him who is declaring right the wicked, his belief is reckoned for righteousness,
<sup>6</sup> even as Dawiḏ also says of the blessedness of the man to whom Elohim reckons righteousness without works:
<sup>7</sup> “Blessed are those whose lawlessnesses are forgiven, and whose sins are covered,
<sup>8</sup> blessed is the man to whom יהוה shall by no means reckon sin.”
<sup>9</sup> Is this blessing then upon the circumcised only, or also upon the uncircumcised? For we affirm: Belief was reckoned unto Aḇraham for righteousness.
<sup>10</sup> How then was it reckoned? Being in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.
<sup>11</sup> And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the belief while in uncircumcision, for him to be a father of all those believing through uncircumcision, for righteousness to be reckoned to them also,
<sup>12</sup> and the father of circumcision to those who not only are of the circumcision, but who also walk in the steps of the belief which our father Aḇraham had in uncircumcision.
<sup>13</sup> For the promise that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Aḇraham or to his seed through the Torah, but through a righteousness of belief.
<sup>14</sup> For if those who are of the Torah are heirs, belief has been made useless, and the promise has been nullified,
<sup>15</sup> for the Torah works out wrath, for where there is no Torah there is no transgression.
<sup>16</sup> On account of this it is of belief, that it be according to favour, for the promise to be made certain to all the seed, not only to those who are of the Torah, but also to those who are of the belief of Aḇraham, who is father of us all –
<sup>17</sup> as it has been written, “I have made you a father of many nations” – in the presence of Him whom he believed, even Elohim, who gives life to the dead and calls that which does not exist as existing,
<sup>18</sup> who against all expectation did believe, in expectation, so that he should become father of many nations, according to what was said, “So shall your seed be.”
<sup>19</sup> And not having grown weak in belief, he did not consider his own body, already dead, being about a hundred years old, and the deadness of Sarah’s womb,
<sup>20</sup> he did not hesitate about the promise of Elohim through unbelief, but was strengthened in belief, giving esteem to Elohim,
<sup>21</sup> and being completely persuaded that what He had promised He was also able to do.
<sup>22</sup> Therefore also “it was reckoned to him for righteousness.”
<sup>23</sup> And not because of him alone was it written that it was reckoned to him,
<sup>24</sup> but also because of us, to whom it shall be reckoned, to us who believe in Him who raised up יהושע our Master from the dead,
<sup>25</sup> who was delivered up because of our trespasses, and was raised for us to be declared right.
