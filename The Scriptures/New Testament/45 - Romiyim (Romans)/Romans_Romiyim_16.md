<sup>1</sup> And I commend to you Phoebe our sister, who is a servant of the assembly in Kenḥrea,

<sup>2</sup> that you receive her in יהוה, worthy of the set-apart ones, and assist her in whatever matter she has need of you. For she has been a great help to many, including me.

<sup>3</sup> Greet Priscilla and Aqulas, my fellow workers in Messiah יהושע,

<sup>4</sup> who risked their own necks for my life, to whom not only I give thanks, but also all the assemblies of the gentiles,

<sup>5</sup> and the assembly that is in their house. Greet my beloved Epainetos, who is the first-fruits of Achaia to Messiah.

<sup>6</sup> Greet Miryam, who worked very hard for us.

<sup>7</sup> Greet Andronikos and Junias, my relatives and my fellow prisoners, who are eminent among the emissaries, who also were in Messiah before me.

<sup>8</sup> Greet Amplias, my beloved in יהוה.

<sup>9</sup> Greet Urbanus, our fellow worker in Messiah, and Stachus, my beloved.

<sup>10</sup> Greet Apelles, the approved in Messiah. Greet those who are of Aristobulos.

<sup>11</sup> Greet Herodion, my relative. Greet those who are of Narcissus who are in יהוה.

<sup>12</sup> Greet Truphaina and Truphosa, who work in יהוה. Greet the beloved Persis, who worked very hard in יהוה.

<sup>13</sup> Greet Rufus, chosen in יהוה and his mother and mine.

<sup>14</sup> Greet Asugritos, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brothers who are with them.

<sup>15</sup> Greet Philologos and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olumpas, and all the set-apart ones who are with them.

<sup>16</sup> Greet one another with a set-apart kiss. The assemblies of Messiah greet you.

<sup>17</sup> Now I call upon you, brothers, watch out for those who cause divisions and stumbling, contrary to the teaching which you learned, and turn away from them.

<sup>18</sup> For such ones do not serve our Master יהושע Messiah, but their own stomach, and by smooth words and flattering speech they deceive the hearts of the innocent.

<sup>19</sup> Your obedience, indeed, is reported to all. Therefore I rejoice concerning you, but I wish you to be wise indeed as to the good, and simple toward the evil.

<sup>20</sup> And the Elohim of peace shall crush Satan under your feet shortly. The favour of our Master יהושע Messiah be with you. Amĕn.

<sup>21</sup> Timothy, my fellow worker, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater, my relatives, greet you.

<sup>22</sup> I, Tertius, who wrote this letter, greet you in יהוה.

<sup>23</sup> Gaios, the host of all the assembly and me, greets you. Ĕrastos, the treasurer of the city, greets you, and Quartus, a brother.

<sup>24</sup> The favour of our Master יהושע Messiah be with you all. Amĕn.

<sup>25</sup> And to Him who is able to establish you according to my Good News and the preaching of יהושע Messiah, according to the revelation of the secret which was kept silent since times of old,

<sup>26</sup> but now has been made manifest, and by the prophetic Scriptures has been made known to all nations, according to the command of the everlasting Elohim, for belief-obedience.

<sup>27</sup> To Elohim, wise alone, be the esteem, through יהושע Messiah forever. Amĕn.
