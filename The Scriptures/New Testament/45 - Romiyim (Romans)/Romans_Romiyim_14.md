<sup>1</sup> And receive him who is weak in the belief, not criticising his thoughts.

<sup>2</sup> One indeed believes to eat all food, but he who is weak eats only vegetables.

<sup>3</sup> He that eats, let him not despise him who does not eat, and he that does not eat, let him not judge him who eats, for Elohim received him.

<sup>4</sup> Who are you that judges another’s servant? To his own master he stands or falls. But he shall be made to stand, for Elohim is able to make him stand.

<sup>5</sup> One indeed judges one day above another, another judges every day alike. Let each one be completely persuaded in his own mind.

<sup>6</sup> He who minds the day, minds it to יהוה. And he who does not mind the day, to יהוה he does not mind it. He who eats, eats to יהוה, for he gives Elohim thanks. And he who does not eat, to יהוה he does not eat, and gives Elohim thanks.

<sup>7</sup> For not one of us lives to himself, and not one dies to himself.

<sup>8</sup> For both, if we live, we live unto the Master, and if we die, we die unto the Master. Therefore, whether we live or die, we are the Master’s.

<sup>9</sup> For unto this Messiah died and rose and lived again, to rule over both the dead and the living.

<sup>10</sup> But why do you judge your brother? Or why do you despise your brother? For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Messiah.

<sup>11</sup> For it has been written, “As I live, says יהוה, every knee shall bow to Me, and every tongue shall confess to Elohim.”

<sup>12</sup> Each one of us, therefore, shall give account of himself to Elohim.

<sup>13</sup> Therefore let us not judge one another any longer, but rather judge this, not to put an obstacle or a stumbling-block in our brother’s way.

<sup>14</sup> I know and am persuaded in the Master יהושע that none at all is common of itself. But to him who regards whatever to be common, to him it is common.

<sup>15</sup> And if your brother is grieved because of your food, you are no longer walking in love. Do not by your food ruin the one for whom Messiah died.

<sup>16</sup> Do not then allow your good to be spoken of as evil.

<sup>17</sup> For the reign of Elohim is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Set-apart Spirit.

<sup>18</sup> For he who is serving Messiah in these matters is well-pleasing to Elohim and approved by men.

<sup>19</sup> So, then, let us pursue the matters of peace and the matters for building up one another.

<sup>20</sup> Do not destroy the work of Elohim for the sake of food. All indeed are clean, but evil to that man who eats so as to cause stumbling.

<sup>21</sup> It is good not to eat meat or drink wine, nor to do whatever by which your brother stumbles.

<sup>22</sup> Do you have belief? Have it to yourself before Elohim. Blessed is he who does not condemn himself in what he approves.

<sup>23</sup> But he who doubts, if he eats, is condemned, because it is not of belief, and all that is not of belief is sin.
