<sup>1</sup> Remind them to be subject to rulers and authorities, to obey, to be ready for every good work,

<sup>2</sup> not to slander anyone, not to be quarrelsome, to be gentle, showing all meekness to all men.

<sup>3</sup> For we ourselves were also once foolish, disobedient, led astray, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in evil and envy, being hated and hating one another.

<sup>4</sup> But when the kindness and the love of Elohim our Saviour toward man appeared,

<sup>5</sup> He saved us, not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to His compassion, through the washing of rebirth, and renewal by the Set-apart Spirit,

<sup>6</sup> which He poured out on us richly through יהושע Messiah our Saviour,

<sup>7</sup> that having been declared right by His favour we should become heirs according to the expectation of everlasting life.

<sup>8</sup> Trustworthy is the word, and in this regard I wish you to strongly affirm, that those who have believed in Elohim should keep their minds on maintaining good works. This is good and profitable to men.

<sup>9</sup> But keep away from foolish questions, and genealogies, and strife and quarrels about the Torah, for they are unprofitable and useless.

<sup>10</sup> Reject a divisive man after the first and second warning,

<sup>11</sup> knowing that such a one has been perverted, and sins, being self-condemned.

<sup>12</sup> When I shall send Artemas to you, or Tuchikos, do your best to come to me at Nikopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there.

<sup>13</sup> Do your best to send Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey, so that they lack none at all.

<sup>14</sup> And our brothers should also learn to maintain good works, to meet urgent needs, so that they shall not be without fruit.

<sup>15</sup> All those with me greet you. Greet those who love us in the belief. Favour be with you all. Amĕn.
