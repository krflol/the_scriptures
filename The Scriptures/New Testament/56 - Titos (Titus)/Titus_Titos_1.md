<sup>1</sup> Sha’ul, a servant of Elohim and an emissary of יהושע Messiah, according to the belief of Elohim’s chosen ones and knowledge of the truth according to reverence,

<sup>2</sup> in expectation of everlasting life which Elohim, who does not lie, promised before times of old,

<sup>3</sup> but in its own times has manifested His word through preaching, with which I was entrusted according to the command of Elohim our Saviour,

<sup>4</sup> to Titus, a genuine child according to our common belief: Favour, compassion, peace from Elohim the Father and the Master יהושע Messiah our Saviour.

<sup>5</sup> The reason I left you in Crete was that you should straighten out what was left undone, and appoint elders in every city as I commanded you:

<sup>6</sup> if anyone is unreprovable, the husband of one wife, having believing children not accused of loose behaviour, or unruly.

<sup>7</sup> For an overseer has to be unreprovable, as a managing one of Elohim, not self-pleasing, not wroth, not given to wine, no brawler, not greedy for filthy gain,

<sup>8</sup> but kind to strangers, a lover of what is good, sensible, righteous, set-apart, self-controlled,

<sup>9</sup> clinging to the trustworthy word, according to the teaching, in order to be able both to encourage by sound teaching, and to reprove those who oppose it.

<sup>10</sup> For there are many unruly men, senseless talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision,

<sup>11</sup> whose mouths have to be stopped, who upset entire households, teaching what they should not teach, for the sake of filthy gain.

<sup>12</sup> One of them, a prophet of their own, said, “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.”

<sup>13</sup> This witness is true. Therefore rebuke them sharply, in order for them to be sound in the belief,

<sup>14</sup> not paying attention to Yehuḏite fables, and commands of men who turn from the truth.

<sup>15</sup> Indeed, all matters are clean to the clean, but to those who are defiled and unbelieving no matter is clean, but both their mind and conscience are defiled.

<sup>16</sup> They profess to know Elohim, but in works they deny Him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unfit for any good work.
