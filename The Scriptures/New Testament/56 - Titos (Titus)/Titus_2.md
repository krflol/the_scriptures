<sup>1</sup> But you, speak what is fitting for sound teaching:
<sup>2</sup> the older men are to be sober, serious, sensible, sound in belief, in love, in endurance,
<sup>3</sup> the older women likewise are to be set-apart in behaviour, not slanderers, not given to much wine, teachers of what is good,
<sup>4</sup> in order for them to train the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,
<sup>5</sup> to be sensible, blameless, workers at home, good, subject to their own husbands, in order that the word of Elohim is not evil spoken of.
<sup>6</sup> Likewise urge the young men to be sensible.
<sup>7</sup> Show yourself to them an example of good works in all matters. In teaching show uncorruptness, seriousness,
<sup>8</sup> soundness of speech beyond reproach, in order that the opponent is put to shame, having no evil word to say about you.
<sup>9</sup> Servants should be subject to their own masters, to be well-pleasing in every way, not back-talking,
<sup>10</sup> not stealing, but showing all good trustworthiness, so that they adorn the teaching of Elohim our Saviour in every way.
<sup>11</sup> For the saving Gift of Elohim has appeared to all men,
<sup>12</sup> instructing us to renounce wickedness and worldly lusts, and to live sensibly, righteously, and reverently in the present age,
<sup>13</sup> looking for the blessed expectation and esteemed appearance of the great Elohim and our Saviour יהושע Messiah,
<sup>14</sup> who gave Himself for us, to redeem us from all lawlessness and to cleanse for Himself a people, His own possession, ardent for good works.
<sup>15</sup> Speak these matters, urge, and reprove with all authority. Let no one despise you.
