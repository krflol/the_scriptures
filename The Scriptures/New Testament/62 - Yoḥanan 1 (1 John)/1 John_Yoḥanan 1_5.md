<sup>1</sup> Everyone who believes that יהושע is the Messiah has been born of Elohim, and everyone who loves the One bringing forth also loves the one having been born of Him.

<sup>2</sup> By this we know that we love the children of Elohim, when we love Elohim and guard His commands.

<sup>3</sup> For this is the love for Elohim, that we guard His commands, and His commands are not heavy,

<sup>4</sup> because everyone having been born of Elohim overcomes the world. And this is the overcoming that has overcome the world: our belief.

<sup>5</sup> Who is the one who overcomes the world but he who believes that יהושע is the Son of Elohim?

<sup>6</sup> This is the One that came by water and blood: יהושע Messiah, not only by water, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit who bears witness, because the Spirit is the Truth.

<sup>7</sup> Because there are three who bear witness:

<sup>8</sup> the Spirit, and the water, and the blood. And the three are in agreement.

<sup>9</sup> If we receive the witness of men, the witness of Elohim is greater, because this is the witness of Elohim which He has witnessed concerning His Son.

<sup>10</sup> The one who believes in the Son of Elohim has the witness in himself, the one who does not believe Elohim has made Him a liar, because he has not believed the witness that Elohim has given concerning His Son.

<sup>11</sup> And this is the witness: that Elohim has given us everlasting life, and this life is in His Son.

<sup>12</sup> He who possesses the Son possesses life, he who does not possess the Son of Elohim does not possess life.

<sup>13</sup> I have written this to you who believe in the Name of the Son of Elohim, so that you know that you possess everlasting life, and so that you believe in the Name of the Son of Elohim.

<sup>14</sup> And this is the boldness that we have in Him, that if we ask whatever according to His desire, He hears us.

<sup>15</sup> And if we know that He hears us, whatever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we have asked of Him.

<sup>16</sup> If anyone sees his brother sinning a sin, not unto death, he shall ask, and He shall give him life for those not sinning unto death. There is a sin unto death. I do not say that he should pray about that.

<sup>17</sup> All unrighteousness is sin, and there is a sin not unto death.

<sup>18</sup> We know that everyone having been born of Elohim does not sin, but the one having been born of Elohim guards himself, and the wicked one does not touch him.

<sup>19</sup> We know that we are of Elohim, and all the world lies in the wicked one.

<sup>20</sup> And we know that the Son of Elohim has come and has given us an understanding, so that we might know the true One. And we are in the true One, in His Son יהושע Messiah. This is the true Elohim and everlasting life.

<sup>21</sup> Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amĕn.
