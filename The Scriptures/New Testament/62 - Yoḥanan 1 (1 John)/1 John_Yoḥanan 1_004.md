<sup>1</sup> Beloved ones, do not believe every spirit, but prove the spirits, whether they are of Elohim, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.

<sup>2</sup> By this you know the Spirit of Elohim: Every spirit that confesses that יהושע Messiah has come in the flesh is of Elohim,

<sup>3</sup> and every spirit that does not confess that יהושע Messiah has come in the flesh is not of Elohim. And this is the spirit of the anti-messiah which you heard is coming, and now is already in the world.

<sup>4</sup> You are of Elohim, little children, and have overcome them, because He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world.

<sup>5</sup> They are of the world, therefore they speak as of the world, and the world hears them.

<sup>6</sup> We are of Elohim – the one knowing Elohim hears us. He who is not of Elohim does not hear us. By this we know the Spirit of the Truth and the spirit of the delusion.

<sup>7</sup> Beloved ones, let us love one another, because love is of Elohim, and everyone who loves has been born of Elohim, and knows Elohim.

<sup>8</sup> The one who does not love does not know Elohim, for Elohim is love.

<sup>9</sup> By this the love of Elohim was manifested in us, that Elohim has sent His only brought-forth Son into the world, in order that we might live through Him.

<sup>10</sup> In this is love, not that we loved Elohim, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be an atoning offering for our sins.

<sup>11</sup> Beloved ones, if Elohim so loved us, we also ought to love one another.

<sup>12</sup> No one has seen Elohim at any time. If we love one another, Elohim does stay in us, and His love has been perfected in us.

<sup>13</sup> By this we know that we stay in Him, and He in us, because He has given us of His Spirit.

<sup>14</sup> And we have seen and bear witness that the Father has sent the Son, Saviour of the world.

<sup>15</sup> Whoever confesses that יהושע is the Son of Elohim, Elohim stays in him, and he in Elohim.

<sup>16</sup> And we have known and believed the love that Elohim has for us. Elohim is love, and he who stays in love stays in Elohim, and Elohim in him.

<sup>17</sup> By this love has been perfected with us, in order that we might have boldness in the day of judgment, because as He is so are we in this world.

<sup>18</sup> There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear, because fear holds punishment, and he who fears has not been made perfect in love.

<sup>19</sup> We love Him because He first loved us.

<sup>20</sup> If someone says, “I love Elohim,” and hates his brother, he is a liar. For the one not loving his brother whom he has seen, how is he able to love Elohim whom he has not seen?

<sup>21</sup> And we have this command from Him, that the one loving Elohim should love his brother too.
