<sup>1</sup> What was from the beginning, what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, concerning the Word of life:

<sup>2</sup> And the life was manifested, and we have seen, and bear witness, and announce to you that everlasting life which was with the Father and was manifested to us.

<sup>3</sup> We announce to you what we have seen and heard, so that you too might have fellowship with us. And truly our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son יהושע Messiah.

<sup>4</sup> And we write this to you in order that your joy might be complete.

<sup>5</sup> And this is the message which we have heard from Him and announce to you, that Elohim is light and in Him is no darkness at all.

<sup>6</sup> If we say that we have fellowship with Him, and walk in darkness, we lie and are not doing the truth.

<sup>7</sup> But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of יהושע Messiah His Son cleanses us from all sin.

<sup>8</sup> If we say that we have no sin, we are misleading ourselves, and the truth is not in us.

<sup>9</sup> If we confess our sins, He is trustworthy and righteous to forgive us the sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

<sup>10</sup> If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar, and His Word is not in us.
