<sup>1</sup> Then יהושע was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tried by the devil.

<sup>2</sup> And after having fasted forty days and forty nights, He was hungry.

<sup>3</sup> And the trier came and said to Him, “If You are the Son of Elohim, command that these stones become bread.”

<sup>4</sup> But He answering, said, “It has been written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of יהוה.’ ”

<sup>5</sup> Then the devil took Him up into the set-apart city, set Him on the edge of the Set-apart Place,

<sup>6</sup> and said to Him, “If You are the Son of Elohim, throw Yourself down. For it has been written, ‘He shall command His messengers concerning you,’ and, ‘In their hands they shall bear you up, so that you do not dash your foot against a stone.’ ”

<sup>7</sup> יהושע said to him, “It has also been written, ‘You shall not try יהוה your Elohim.’ ”

<sup>8</sup> Again, the devil took Him up on a very high mountain, and showed Him all the reigns of the world, and their esteem,

<sup>9</sup> and said to Him, “All these I shall give You if You fall down and worship me.”

<sup>10</sup> Then יהושע said to him, “Go, Satan! For it has been written, ‘You shall worship יהוה your Elohim, and Him alone you shall serve.’ ”

<sup>11</sup> Then the devil left Him, and see, messengers came and attended Him.

<sup>12</sup> And יהושע, having heard that Yoḥanan had been put in prison, withdrew into Galil.

<sup>13</sup> And leaving Natsareth, He came and dwelt in Kephar Naḥum, which is by the sea, in the borders of Zeḇulun and Naphtali,

<sup>14</sup> to fill what was spoken by Yeshayahu the prophet, saying,

<sup>15</sup> “Land of Zeḇulun and land of Naphtali, the way of the sea, beyond the Yardĕn, Galil of the gentiles –

<sup>16</sup> the people who sat in darkness saw a great light, and upon those who sat in the land and shadow of death, light arose to them.”

<sup>17</sup> From that time יהושע began to proclaim and to say, “Repent, for the reign of the heavens has drawn near.”

<sup>18</sup> And יהושע, walking by the Sea of Galil, saw two brothers, Shim‛on called Kĕpha, and Andri his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.

<sup>19</sup> And He said to them, “Follow Me, and I shall make you fishers of men.”

<sup>20</sup> And immediately they left their nets and followed Him.

<sup>21</sup> And going on from there, He saw two other brothers, Ya‛aqoḇ the son of Zaḇdai, and Yoḥanan his brother, in the boat with Zaḇdai their father, mending their nets. And He called them,

<sup>22</sup> and immediately they left the boat and their father, and followed Him.

<sup>23</sup> And יהושע went about all Galil, teaching in their congregations, and proclaiming the Good News of the reign, and healing every disease and every bodily weakness among the people.

<sup>24</sup> And news about Him went out into all Syria. And they brought to Him all who were sick, afflicted with various diseases and pains, and those who were demon-possessed, and epileptics, and paralytics. And He healed them.

<sup>25</sup> And large crowds – from Galil, and Dekapolis, and Yerushalayim, and Yehuḏah, and beyond the Yardĕn – followed Him.
