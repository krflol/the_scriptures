<sup>1</sup> And in those days Yoḥanan the Immerser came proclaiming in the wilderness of Yehuḏah,

<sup>2</sup> and saying, “Repent, for the reign of the heavens has come near!”

<sup>3</sup> For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Yeshayahu, saying, “A voice of one crying in the wilderness, ‘Prepare the way of יהוה, make His paths straight.’ ”

<sup>4</sup> And Yoḥanan had a garment of camel’s hair, and a leather girdle around his waist. And his food was locusts and wild honey.

<sup>5</sup> Then Yerushalayim, and all Yehuḏah, and all the country around the Yardĕn went out to him,

<sup>6</sup> and they were immersed by him in the Yardĕn, confessing their sins.

<sup>7</sup> And seeing many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his immersion, he said to them, “Brood of adders! Who has warned you to flee from the coming wrath?

<sup>8</sup> “Bear, therefore, fruits worthy of repentance,

<sup>9</sup> and do not think to say to yourselves, ‘We have Aḇraham as father.’ For I say to you that Elohim is able to raise up children to Aḇraham from these stones.

<sup>10</sup> “And the axe is already laid to the root of the trees. Every tree, then, which does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.

<sup>11</sup> “I indeed immerse you in water unto repentance, but He who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to bear. He shall immerse you in the Set-apart Spirit and fire.

<sup>12</sup> “His winnowing fork is in His hand, and He shall thoroughly cleanse His threshing-floor, and gather His wheat into the storehouse, but the chaff He shall burn with unquenchable fire.”

<sup>13</sup> Then יהושע came from Galil to Yoḥanan at the Yardĕn to be immersed by him.

<sup>14</sup> But Yoḥanan was hindering Him, saying, “I need to be immersed by You, and You come to me?”

<sup>15</sup> But יהושע answering, said to him, “Permit it now, for thus it is fitting for us to fill all righteousness.” Then he permitted Him.

<sup>16</sup> And having been immersed, יהושע went up immediately from the water, and see, the heavens were opened, and He saw the Spirit of Elohim descending like a dove and coming upon Him,

<sup>17</sup> and see, a voice out of the heavens, saying, “This is My Son, the Beloved, in whom I did delight.”
