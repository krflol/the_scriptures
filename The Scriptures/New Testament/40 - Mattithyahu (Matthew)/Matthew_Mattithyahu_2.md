<sup>1</sup> And יהושע having been born in Bĕyth Leḥem of Yehuḏah in the days of Herodes the sovereign, see, Magi from the East came to Yerushalayim,

<sup>2</sup> saying, “Where is He who has been born Sovereign of the Yehuḏim? For we saw His star in the East and have come to do reverence to Him.”

<sup>3</sup> And Herodes the sovereign, having heard, was troubled, and all Yerushalayim with him.

<sup>4</sup> And having gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he asked them where the Messiah was to be born.

<sup>5</sup> And they said to him, “In Bĕyth Leḥem of Yehuḏah, for thus it has been written by the prophet,

<sup>6</sup> ‘But you, Bĕyth Leḥem, in the land of Yehuḏah, you are by no means least among the rulers of Yehuḏah, for out of you shall come a Ruler who shall shepherd My people Yisra’ĕl.’ ”

<sup>7</sup> Then Herodes, having called the Magi secretly, learned exactly from them what time the star appeared.

<sup>8</sup> And having sent them to Bĕyth Leḥem, he said, “Go and search diligently for the Child, and when you have found Him, bring back word to me, so that I too might go and do reverence to Him.”

<sup>9</sup> And having heard the sovereign, they went. And see, the star which they had seen in the East went before them, until it came and stood over where the Child was.

<sup>10</sup> And seeing the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy.

<sup>11</sup> And coming into the house, they saw the Child with Miryam His mother, and fell down and did reverence to Him, and opening their treasures, they presented to Him gifts of gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.

<sup>12</sup> And having been warned in a dream that they should not return to Herodes, they departed for their own country by another way.

<sup>13</sup> And when they had left, see, a messenger of יהוה appeared to Yosĕph in a dream, saying, “Arise, take the Child and His mother, and flee to Mitsrayim, and remain there until I bring you word, for Herodes is about to seek the Child to destroy Him.”

<sup>14</sup> And rising up, he took the Child and His mother by night and departed for Mitsrayim,

<sup>15</sup> and remained there until the death of Herodes, to fill what was spoken by יהוה through the prophet, saying, “Out of Mitsrayim I have called My Son.”

<sup>16</sup> Then Herodes, having seen that he was fooled by the Magi, was greatly enraged, and he sent forth and slew all the male children in Bĕyth Leḥem and in all its borders, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had exactly learnt from the Magi.

<sup>17</sup> Then was filled what was spoken by Yirmeyahu the prophet, saying,

<sup>18</sup> “A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and weeping, and great mourning – Raḥĕl weeping for her children, refusing to be comforted, because they were no more.”

<sup>19</sup> And Herodes having died, see, a messenger of יהוה appeared in a dream to Yosĕph in Mitsrayim,

<sup>20</sup> saying, “Arise, and take the Child and His mother, and go into the land of Yisra’ĕl, for those seeking the life of the Child are dead.”

<sup>21</sup> And rising up, he took the Child and His mother, and came into the land of Yisra’ĕl.

<sup>22</sup> But hearing that Archelaos was reigning over Yehuḏah instead of his father Herodes, he was afraid to go there. And having been warned in a dream, he departed to the parts of Galil,

<sup>23</sup> and came and dwelt in a city called Natsareth – thus to fill what was spoken by the prophets, “He shall be called a Natsarene.”
