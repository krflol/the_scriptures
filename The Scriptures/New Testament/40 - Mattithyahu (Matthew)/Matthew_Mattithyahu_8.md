<sup>1</sup> And when He came down from the mountain, large crowds followed Him.

<sup>2</sup> And see, a leper came, and bowed before Him, saying, “Master, if You desire, You are able to make me clean.”

<sup>3</sup> And stretching out His hand יהושע touched him, saying, “I desire it. Be cleansed!” And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.

<sup>4</sup> And יהושע said to him, “See, mention it to no one. But go your way, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Mosheh commanded, as a witness to them.”

<sup>5</sup> And when יהושע had entered Kephar Naḥum, a captain came to Him, appealing to Him,

<sup>6</sup> saying, “Master, my servant is lying in the house paralysed, grievously tortured.”

<sup>7</sup> And יהושע said to him, “I shall come and heal him.”

<sup>8</sup> And the captain answering, said, “Master, I am not worthy that You should come under my roof. But only say a word, and my servant shall be healed.

<sup>9</sup> “For I too am a man under authority, having soldiers under me. And I say to this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes, and to another, ‘Come,’ and he comes, and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”

<sup>10</sup> And when יהושע heard, He marvelled, and said to those who followed, “Truly, I say to you, not even in Yisra’ĕl have I found such great belief!

<sup>11</sup> “And I say to you that many shall come from east and west, and sit down with Aḇraham, and Yitsḥaq, and Ya‛aqoḇ in the reign of the heavens,

<sup>12</sup> but the sons of the reign shall be cast out into outer darkness – there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”

<sup>13</sup> And יהושע said to the captain, “Go, and as you have believed, so let it be done for you.” And his servant was healed that hour.

<sup>14</sup> And when יהושע had come into the house of Kĕpha, He saw his wife’s mother lying sick with inflammation.

<sup>15</sup> And He touched her hand, and the inflammation left her. And she arose and served them.

<sup>16</sup> And when evening had come, they brought to Him many who were demon-possessed. And He cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick,

<sup>17</sup> that it might be filled what was spoken by Yeshayahu the prophet, saying, “He Himself took our weaknesses and bore our sicknesses.”

<sup>18</sup> And when יהושע saw large crowds about Him, He gave a command to go off to the other side.

<sup>19</sup> And a certain scribe, having come near, said to Him, “Teacher, I shall follow You wherever You go.”

<sup>20</sup> And יהושע said to him, “The foxes have holes and the birds of the heaven nests, but the Son of Aḏam has nowhere to lay His head.”

<sup>21</sup> And another of His taught ones said to Him, “Master, first let me go and bury my father.”

<sup>22</sup> But יהושע said to him, “Follow Me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead.”

<sup>23</sup> And when He entered into a boat, His taught ones followed Him.

<sup>24</sup> And see, a great gale arose on the sea, so that the boat was covered by the waves. But He was sleeping.

<sup>25</sup> And His taught ones came to Him and woke Him up, saying, “Master, save us! We are perishing!”

<sup>26</sup> And He said to them, “Why are you afraid, O you of little belief?” Then, having risen, He rebuked the winds and the sea. And there was a great calm.

<sup>27</sup> And the men marvelled, saying, “What is this, that even the winds and the sea obey Him?”

<sup>28</sup> And when He came to the other side, to the country of the Girgashites, two demon-possessed ones met Him, coming out of the tombs, very fierce, so that no one was able to pass that way.

<sup>29</sup> And see, they cried out, saying, “What have we to do with You, יהושע, Son of Elohim? Have You come here to torture us, before the appointed time?”

<sup>30</sup> And at a distance from them there was a herd of many pigs feeding,

<sup>31</sup> and the demons begged Him, saying, “If You cast us out, send us into the herd of pigs.”

<sup>32</sup> And He said to them, “Go.” And they, coming out, went into the herd of pigs. And see, the entire herd of pigs rushed down the steep place into the sea, and died in the water.

<sup>33</sup> And the herdsmen fled, and went away into the city and reported all this, and about those possessed by demons.

<sup>34</sup> And see, all the city came out to meet יהושע. And when they saw Him, they begged Him to leave their borders.

<sup>1</sup> And when He came down from the mountain, large crowds followed Him.
