<sup>1</sup> And having called His twelve taught ones near, He gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every bodily weakness.

<sup>2</sup> And these are the names of the twelve emissaries: first, Shim‛on, who is called Kĕpha, and Andri his brother; Ya‛aqoḇ the son of Zaḇdai, and Yoḥanan his brother;

<sup>3</sup> Philip and Bartholomi; T’oma and Mattithyahu the tax collector; Ya‛aqoḇ the son of Alphai, and Laḇai whose last name was Taddai;

<sup>4</sup> Shim‛on the Kena‛anite, and Yehuḏah from Qerioth, who did also deliver Him up.

<sup>5</sup> יהושע sent these twelve out, having commanded them, saying, “Do not go into the way of the gentiles, and do not enter a city of the Shomeronites,

<sup>6</sup> but rather go to the lost sheep of the house of Yisra’ĕl.

<sup>7</sup> “And as you go, proclaim, saying, ‘The reign of the heavens has drawn near.’

<sup>8</sup> “Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out demons. You have received without paying, give without being paid.

<sup>9</sup> “Do not acquire gold or silver or copper for your moneybelts,

<sup>10</sup> or a bag for the journey, or two undergarments, or sandals, or staffs, for the worker is worthy of his food.

<sup>11</sup> “And into whatever city or village you enter, ask who is worthy in it, and stay there until you leave.

<sup>12</sup> “And as you enter into a house, greet it.

<sup>13</sup> “And if the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it. But if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you.

<sup>14</sup> “And whoever does not receive you nor hear your words, when you leave that house or city, shake off the dust from your feet.

<sup>15</sup> “Truly, I say to you, it shall be more bearable for the land of Seḏom and Amorah in the day of judgment than for that city!

<sup>16</sup> “See, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves. Therefore be wise as serpents and innocent as doves.

<sup>17</sup> “But beware of men, for they shall deliver you up to sanhedrins and flog you in their congregations.

<sup>18</sup> “And you shall be brought before governors and sovereigns for My sake, as a witness to them and to the gentiles.

<sup>19</sup> “But when they deliver you up, do not worry about how or what you should speak. For it shall be given to you in that hour what you shall speak,

<sup>20</sup> for it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father speaking in you.

<sup>21</sup> “And brother shall deliver up brother to death, and a father his child. And children shall rise up against parents and shall put them to death.

<sup>22</sup> “And you shall be hated by all for My Name’s sake. But he who shall have endured to the end shall be saved.

<sup>23</sup> “And when they persecute you in this city, flee to another. For truly, I say to you, you shall by no means have gone through the cities of Yisra’ĕl before the Son of Aḏam comes.

<sup>24</sup> “A taught one is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his master.

<sup>25</sup> “It is enough for the taught one to become like his teacher, and a servant like his master. If they have called the master of the house Be‛elzebul, how much more those of his household!

<sup>26</sup> “Therefore do not fear them. For whatever is covered shall be revealed, and whatever is hidden shall be made known.

<sup>27</sup> “What I say to you in the dark, speak in the light. And what you hear in the ear, proclaim on the house-tops.

<sup>28</sup> “And do not fear those who kill the body but are unable to kill the being. But rather fear Him who is able to destroy both being and body in Gehenna.

<sup>29</sup> “Are not two sparrows sold for a copper coin? And not one of them falls to the ground without your Father.

<sup>30</sup> “And even the hairs of your head are all numbered.

<sup>31</sup> “So do not fear, you are worth more than many sparrows.

<sup>32</sup> “Everyone, therefore, who shall confess Me before men, him I shall also confess before My Father who is in the heavens.

<sup>33</sup> “But whoever shall deny Me before men, him I shall also deny before My Father who is in the heavens.

<sup>34</sup> “Do not think that I have come to bring peace on earth. I did not come to bring peace but a sword,

<sup>35</sup> for I have come to bring division, a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law –

<sup>36</sup> and a man’s enemies are those of his own household.

<sup>37</sup> “He who loves father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me, and he who loves son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me.

<sup>38</sup> “And he who does not take up his stake and follow after Me is not worthy of Me.

<sup>39</sup> “He who has found his life shall lose it, and he that has lost his life for My sake shall find it.

<sup>40</sup> “He who receives you receives Me, and he who receives Me receives Him who sent Me.

<sup>41</sup> “He who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet’s reward. And he who receives a righteous one in the name of a righteous one shall receive a righteous one’s reward.

<sup>42</sup> “And whoever gives one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a taught one, truly, I say to you, he shall by no means lose his reward.”
