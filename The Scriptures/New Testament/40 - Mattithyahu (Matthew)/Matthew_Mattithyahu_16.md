<sup>1</sup> And the Pharisees and Sadducees came, and trying Him asked that He would show them a sign from heaven.

<sup>2</sup> And He answering, said to them, “When it is evening you say, ‘Fair weather, for the heaven is red,’

<sup>3</sup> and in the morning, ‘Stormy weather today, for the heaven is red and overcast.’ You know how to discern the face of the heaven, but you are unable to discern the signs of the times!

<sup>4</sup> “A wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and no sign shall be given to it except the sign of the prophet Yonah.” And He left them and went away.

<sup>5</sup> And His taught ones came to the other side, and had forgotten to take bread.

<sup>6</sup> And יהושע said to them, “Mind! And beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.”

<sup>7</sup> And they reasoned among themselves, saying, “Because we brought no bread!”

<sup>8</sup> But יהושע, aware of this, said to them, “O you of little belief, why do you reason among yourselves because you brought no bread?

<sup>9</sup> “Do you still not understand, neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand and how many baskets you picked up?

<sup>10</sup> “Or the seven loaves of the four thousand and how many large baskets you picked up?

<sup>11</sup> “How is it that you do not understand that I did not speak to you concerning bread, but to beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees?”

<sup>12</sup> Then they understood that He did not say to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.

<sup>13</sup> Now when יהושע came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi, He asked His taught ones, saying, “Who do men say the Son of Aḏam is?”

<sup>14</sup> And they said, “Some say Yoḥanan the Immerser, and others Ĕliyahu, and others Yirmeyahu or one of the prophets.”

<sup>15</sup> He said to them, “And you, who do you say I am?”

<sup>16</sup> And Shim‛on Kĕpha answering, said, “You are the Messiah, the Son of the living Elohim.”

<sup>17</sup> And יהושע answering, said to him, “Blessed are you, Shim‛on Bar-Yonah, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father in the heavens.

<sup>18</sup> “And I also say to you that you are Kĕpha, and on this rock I shall build My assembly, and the gates of the grave shall not overcome it.

<sup>19</sup> “And I shall give you the keys of the reign of the heavens, and whatever you bind on earth shall be having been bound in the heavens, and whatever you loosen on earth shall be having been loosened in the heavens.”

<sup>20</sup> Then He warned His taught ones that they should say to no one that He is יהושע the Messiah.

<sup>21</sup> From that time יהושע began to show to His taught ones that it was necessary for Him to go to Yerushalayim, and to suffer much from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and to be raised again the third day.

<sup>22</sup> And Kĕpha took Him aside and began to rebuke Him, saying, “Be kind to Yourself, Master, this shall not be to You!”

<sup>23</sup> But He turned and said to Kĕpha, “Get behind Me, Satan! You are a stumbling-block to Me, for your thoughts are not those of Elohim, but those of men.”

<sup>24</sup> Then יהושע said to His taught ones, “If anyone wishes to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his stake, and follow Me.

<sup>25</sup> “For whoever wishes to save his life shall lose it, and whoever loses his life for My sake shall find it.

<sup>26</sup> “For what is a man profited if he gains all the world, and loses his own life? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his life?

<sup>27</sup> “For the Son of Aḏam is going to come in the esteem of His Father with His messengers, and then He shall reward each according to his works.

<sup>28</sup> “Truly, I say to you, there are some standing here who shall not taste death at all until they see the Son of Aḏam coming in His reign:”

<sup>1</sup> And the Pharisees and Sadducees came, and trying Him asked that He would show them a sign from heaven.

<sup>2</sup> And He answering, said to them, “When it is evening you say, ‘Fair weather, for the heaven is red,’
