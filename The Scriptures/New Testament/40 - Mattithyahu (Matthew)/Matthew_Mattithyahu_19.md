<sup>1</sup> And it came to be, when יהושע had ended these words, that He left Galil and came to the borders of Yehuḏah beyond the Yardĕn.

<sup>2</sup> And large crowds followed Him, and He healed them there.

<sup>3</sup> And the Pharisees came to Him, trying Him, and saying to Him, “Is it right for a man to put away his wife for every reason?”

<sup>4</sup> And He answering, said to them, “Did you not read that He who made them at the beginning made them male and female,

<sup>5</sup> and said, ‘For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh’?

<sup>6</sup> “So that they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore, what Elohim has joined together, let man not separate.”

<sup>7</sup> They said to Him, “Why then did Mosheh command to give a certificate of divorce, and to put her away?”

<sup>8</sup> He said to them, “Because of the hardness of your hearts, Mosheh allowed you to put away your wives, but from the beginning it was not so.

<sup>9</sup> “And I say to you, whoever puts away his wife, except on the ground of whoring, and marries another, commits adultery. And whoever marries her who has been put away commits adultery.”

<sup>10</sup> His taught ones said to Him, “If such is the case of the man with his wife, it is good not to marry.”

<sup>11</sup> And He said to them, “Not all receive this word, but only those to whom it has been given,

<sup>12</sup> for there are eunuchs who were so born from their mother’s womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the reign of the heavens. He who is able to receive it, let him receive it.”

<sup>13</sup> Then young children were brought to Him to lay His hands on them and pray, and the taught ones rebuked them.

<sup>14</sup> But יהושע said, “Allow the young children and do not stop them from coming to Me, for of such is the reign of the heavens.”

<sup>15</sup> And having laid hands on them He went from there.

<sup>16</sup> And see, one came and said to Him, “Good Teacher, what good shall I do to have everlasting life?”

<sup>17</sup> And He said to him, “Why do you call Me good? No one is good except One – Elohim. But if you wish to enter into life, guard the commands.”

<sup>18</sup> He said to Him, “Which?” And יהושע said, “ ‘You shall not murder,’ ‘You shall not commit adultery,’ ‘You shall not steal,’ ‘You shall not bear false witness,’

<sup>19</sup> ‘Respect your father and your mother,’ and ‘You shall love your neighbour as yourself.’ ”

<sup>20</sup> The young man said to Him, “All these I have watched over from my youth, what do I still lack?”

<sup>21</sup> יהושע said to him, “If you wish to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven. And come, follow Me.”

<sup>22</sup> And when the young man heard the word, he went away sad, because he had many possessions.

<sup>23</sup> And יהושע said to His taught ones, “Truly, I say to you that it is hard for a rich man to enter into the reign of the heavens.

<sup>24</sup> And again I say to you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the reign of Elohim.”

<sup>25</sup> And when His taught ones heard it, they were very astonished, saying, “Who then is able to be saved?”

<sup>26</sup> And looking intently יהושע said to them, “With men this is impossible, but with Elohim all is possible.”

<sup>27</sup> Then Kĕpha answering, said to Him, “See, we have left all and followed You. What then shall we have?”

<sup>28</sup> And יהושע said to them, “Truly I say to you, when the Son of Aḏam sits on the throne of His esteem, you who have followed Me in the rebirth, shall also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Yisra’ĕl.

<sup>29</sup> “And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands, for My Name’s sake, shall receive a hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life.

<sup>30</sup> “But many who are first shall be last, and the last first.
