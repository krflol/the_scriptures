<sup>1</sup> And morning having come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against יהושע, so as to put Him to death.

<sup>2</sup> And having bound Him, they led Him away and delivered Him to Pontius Pilate the governor.

<sup>3</sup> Then Yehuḏah – he who delivered Him up – having seen that He had been condemned, repented, returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and to the elders,

<sup>4</sup> saying, “I have sinned in delivering up innocent blood.” And they said, “What is that to us? You see to it!”

<sup>5</sup> And throwing down the pieces of silver in the Dwelling Place he left, and went and hanged himself.

<sup>6</sup> And the chief priests took the silver pieces and said, “It is not right to put them into the treasury, seeing they are the price of blood.”

<sup>7</sup> So they took counsel and bought with them the potter’s field, for the burial of strangers.

<sup>8</sup> Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood, until today.

<sup>9</sup> Then was filled what was spoken by Yirmeyahu the prophet, saying, “And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of Him who was pierced, on whom they of the children of Yisra’ĕl set a price,

<sup>10</sup> and gave them for the potter’s field, as יהוה had ordered me.”

<sup>11</sup> And יהושע stood before the governor, and the governor asked Him, saying, “Are You the Sovereign of the Yehuḏim?” And יהושע said to him, “You say it.”

<sup>12</sup> And as He was accused by the chief priests and the elders, He answered not.

<sup>13</sup> Then Pilate said to Him, “Do You not hear how much they witness against You?”

<sup>14</sup> And He did not answer him, not one word, so that the governor wondered much.

<sup>15</sup> And at the festival the governor used to release to the crowd one prisoner whom they wished.

<sup>16</sup> And they had then a well-known prisoner called Barabba.

<sup>17</sup> So when they were assembled, Pilate said to them, “Whom do you wish I release to you? Barabba, or יהושע who is called Messiah?”

<sup>18</sup> For he knew that because of envy they had delivered Him up.

<sup>19</sup> And as he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, “Have none at all to do with that righteous Man, for I have suffered much today in a dream because of Him.”

<sup>20</sup> But the chief priests and elders persuaded the crowds that they should ask for Barabba and to destroy יהושע.

<sup>21</sup> And the governor answering, said to them, “Which of the two do you wish I release to you?” They said, “Barabba!”

<sup>22</sup> Pilate said to them, “What then shall I do with יהושע who is called Messiah?” They all said to him, “Let Him be impaled!”

<sup>23</sup> And the governor said, “Indeed, what evil has He done?” And they were crying out all the more, saying, “Let Him be impaled!”

<sup>24</sup> And when Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but rather an uproar was starting, he took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, “I am innocent of the blood of this Righteous One. You shall see to it.”

<sup>25</sup> And all the people answering, said, “His blood be on us and on our children.”

<sup>26</sup> Then he released Barabba to them, but having יהושע whipped, he delivered Him over to be impaled.

<sup>27</sup> Then the soldiers of the governor took יהושע into the court and gathered the entire company of soldiers around Him.

<sup>28</sup> And having stripped Him, they put a scarlet robe on Him.

<sup>29</sup> And plaiting a crown of thorns, they put it on His head, and a reed in His right hand. And they kneeled down before Him and mocked Him, saying, “Greetings, Sovereign of the Yehuḏim!”

<sup>30</sup> And spitting on Him they took the reed and struck Him on the head.

<sup>31</sup> And when they had mocked Him, they took the robe off Him, then put His own garments on Him, and led Him away to be impaled.

<sup>32</sup> And as they were going out, they found a man of Cyrene, Shim‛on by name – they compelled him to bear His stake.

<sup>33</sup> And when they came to a place called Golgotha, that is to say, Place of a Skull,

<sup>34</sup> they gave Him wine mixed with bile to drink. And after tasting, He would not drink it.

<sup>35</sup> And having impaled Him, they divided His garments, casting lots, that it might be filled what was spoken by the prophet, “They divided My garments among them, and for My clothing they cast lots.”

<sup>36</sup> And sitting down, they guarded Him there.

<sup>37</sup> And they put up over His head the written charge against Him: THIS IS יהושע, THE SOVEREIGN OF THE YEHUḎIM.

<sup>38</sup> Then two robbers were impaled with Him, one on the right and another on the left.

<sup>39</sup> And those passing by were blaspheming Him, shaking their heads,

<sup>40</sup> and saying, “You who destroy the Dwelling Place and build it in three days, save Yourself! If You are the Son of Elohim, come down from the stake.”

<sup>41</sup> And likewise the chief priests, with the scribes and elders, mocking, said,

<sup>42</sup> “He saved others – He is unable to save Himself. If He is the Sovereign of Yisra’ĕl, let Him now come down from the stake, and we shall believe Him.

<sup>43</sup> “He trusted in Elohim, let Him rescue Him now if He desires Him, for He said, ‘I am the Son of Elohim.’ ”

<sup>44</sup> And also the robbers who were impaled with Him reviled Him, saying the same.

<sup>45</sup> And from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land, until the ninth hour.

<sup>46</sup> And about the ninth hour יהושע cried out with a loud voice, saying, “Ĕli, Ĕli, lemah sheḇaqtani?” that is, “My Ĕl, My Ĕl, why have You forsaken Me?”

<sup>47</sup> Some of those standing there, having heard, said, “This One calls Ĕliyahu!”

<sup>48</sup> And immediately one of them ran and took a sponge, and filled it with sour wine and put it on a reed, and gave it to Him to drink.

<sup>49</sup> But the rest said, “Leave it, let us see if Ĕliyahu comes to save Him.”

<sup>50</sup> And יהושע cried out again with a loud voice, and gave up His spirit.

<sup>51</sup> And see, the veil of the Dwelling Place was torn in two from top to bottom, and the earth was shaken, and the rocks were split,

<sup>52</sup> and the tombs were opened, and many bodies of the set-apart ones who had fallen asleep were raised,

<sup>53</sup> and coming out of the tombs after His resurrection, they went into the set-apart city and appeared to many.

<sup>54</sup> And when the captain and those with him, who were guarding יהושע, saw the earthquake and all that took place, they feared exceedingly, saying, “Truly this was the Son of Elohim!”

<sup>55</sup> And many women who followed יהושע from Galil, attending Him, were there, watching from a distance,

<sup>56</sup> among whom were Miryam from Maḡdala, and Miryam the mother of Ya‛aqoḇ and Yosĕph, and the mother of Zaḇdai’s sons.

<sup>57</sup> And when evening came, there came a rich man from Ramathayim, named Yosĕph, who himself had also become a taught one of יהושע.

<sup>58</sup> He went to Pilate and asked for the body of יהושע. Then Pilate commanded the body to be given.

<sup>59</sup> And having taken the body, Yosĕph wrapped it in clean linen,

<sup>60</sup> and laid it in his new tomb which he had hewn out of the rock. And he rolled a large stone against the door of the tomb, and went away.

<sup>61</sup> And Miryam from Maḡdala was there, and the other Miryam, sitting opposite the tomb.

<sup>62</sup> On the next day, which was after the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees gathered together to Pilate,

<sup>63</sup> saying, “Master, we remember, while He was still alive, how that deceiver said, ‘After three days I am raised.’

<sup>64</sup> “Command, then, that the tomb be safeguarded until the third day, lest His taught ones come by night and steal Him away, and should say to the people, ‘He was raised from the dead.’ And the last deception shall be worse than the first.”

<sup>65</sup> So Pilate said to them, “You have a watch, go, safeguard it as you know how.”

<sup>66</sup> And they went and safeguarded the tomb, sealing the stone and setting the watch.

<sup>1</sup> And morning having come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against יהושע, so as to put Him to death.

<sup>2</sup> And having bound Him, they led Him away and delivered Him to Pontius Pilate the governor.

<sup>3</sup> Then Yehuḏah – he who delivered Him up – having seen that He had been condemned, repented, returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and to the elders,
