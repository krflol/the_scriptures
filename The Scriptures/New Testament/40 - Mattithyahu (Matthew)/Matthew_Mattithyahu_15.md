<sup>1</sup> Then there came to יהושע scribes and Pharisees from Yerushalayim, saying,

<sup>2</sup> “Why do Your taught ones transgress the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread.”

<sup>3</sup> But He answering, said to them, “Why do you also transgress the command of Elohim because of your tradition?

<sup>4</sup> “For Elohim has commanded, saying, ‘Respect your father and your mother,’ and, ‘He who curses father or mother, let him be put to death.’

<sup>5</sup> “But you say, ‘Whoever says to his father or mother, “Whatever profit you might have received from me has been dedicated,”

<sup>6</sup> is certainly released from respecting his father or mother.’ So you have nullified the command of Elohim by your tradition.

<sup>7</sup> “Hypocrites! Yeshayahu rightly prophesied about you, saying,

<sup>8</sup> ‘This people draw near to Me with their mouth, and respect Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.

<sup>9</sup> ‘But in vain do they worship Me, teaching as teachings the commands of men.’ ”

<sup>10</sup> And calling the crowd near, He said to them, “Hear and understand:

<sup>11</sup> “Not that which goes into the mouth defiles the man, but that which comes out of the mouth, this defiles the man.”

<sup>12</sup> Then His taught ones came and said to Him, “Do You know that the Pharisees stumbled when they heard this word?”

<sup>13</sup> But He answering, said, “Every plant which My heavenly Father has not planted shall be uprooted.

<sup>14</sup> “Leave them alone. They are blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind leads the blind, both shall fall into a ditch.”

<sup>15</sup> And Kĕpha answering, said to Him, “Explain this parable to us.”

<sup>16</sup> And יהושע said, “Are you also still without understanding?

<sup>17</sup> “Do you not understand that whatever enters into the mouth goes into the stomach, and is cast out in the sewer?

<sup>18</sup> “But what comes out of the mouth comes from the heart, and these defile the man.

<sup>19</sup> “For out of the heart come forth wicked reasonings, murders, adulteries, whorings, thefts, false witnessings, slanders.

<sup>20</sup> “These defile the man, but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile the man.”

<sup>21</sup> And יהושע went out from there and withdrew to the parts of Tsor and Tsiḏon.

<sup>22</sup> And see, a woman of Kena‛an came from those borders and cried out to Him, saying, “Have compassion on me, O Master, Son of Dawiḏ! My daughter is badly demon-possessed.”

<sup>23</sup> But He did not answer her a word. And His taught ones came and asked Him, saying, “Send her away, because she cries after us.”

<sup>24</sup> And He answering, said, “I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Yisra’ĕl.”

<sup>25</sup> But she came and was bowing to Him, saying, “Master, help me!”

<sup>26</sup> And He answering, said, “It is not good to take the children’s bread and throw it to the little dogs.”

<sup>27</sup> But she said, “Yea Master, for even the little dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.”

<sup>28</sup> And יהושע answering, said to her, “O woman, your belief is great! Let it be to you as you desire.” And her daughter was healed from that hour.

<sup>29</sup> And moving from there, יהושע came toward the Sea of Galil, and going up on the mountain, He was sitting there.

<sup>30</sup> And large crowds came to Him, having with them those who were lame, blind, dumb, crippled, and many others. And they laid them down at the feet of יהושע, and He healed them,

<sup>31</sup> so that the crowd marvelled when they saw the dumb speaking, the crippled well, the lame walking, and the blind seeing. And they praised the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl.

<sup>32</sup> And יהושע, having called His taught ones near, said, “I have compassion on the crowd, because they have now continued with Me three days and do not have whatever to eat. And I do not wish to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way.”

<sup>33</sup> And His taught ones said to Him, “Where are we to get enough bread in the desert to satisfy such a large crowd?”

<sup>34</sup> And יהושע said to them, “How many loaves do you have?” And they said, “Seven, and a few little fish.”

<sup>35</sup> And He commanded the crowd to sit down on the ground,

<sup>36</sup> and taking the seven loaves and the fish, giving thanks, He broke them and gave to His taught ones, and the taught ones to the crowd.

<sup>37</sup> And all ate and were satisfied, and they picked up what was left over of the broken pieces – seven large baskets, filled.

<sup>38</sup> And those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children.

<sup>39</sup> And dismissing the crowd, He went into the boat, and came to the borders of Maḡdala.

<sup>1</sup> Then there came to יהושע scribes and Pharisees from Yerushalayim, saying,

<sup>2</sup> “Why do Your taught ones transgress the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread.”
