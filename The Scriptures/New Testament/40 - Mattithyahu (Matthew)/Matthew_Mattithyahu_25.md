<sup>1</sup> “Then the reign of the heavens shall be compared to ten maidens who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.

<sup>2</sup> “And five of them were wise, and five foolish.

<sup>3</sup> “Those who were foolish, having taken their lamps, took no oil with them,

<sup>4</sup> but the wise took oil in their containers with their lamps.

<sup>5</sup> “Now while the bridegroom took time, they all slumbered and slept.

<sup>6</sup> “And at midnight a cry was heard, ‘See, the bridegroom is coming, go out to meet him!’

<sup>7</sup> “Then all those maidens rose up and trimmed their lamps.

<sup>8</sup> “And the foolish said to the wise, ‘Give us of your oil, because our lamps are going out.’

<sup>9</sup> “But the wise answered, saying, ‘No, indeed, there would not be enough for us and you. Instead, go to those who sell, and buy for yourselves.’

<sup>10</sup> “And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the wedding feast, and the door was shut.

<sup>11</sup> “And later the other maidens also came, saying, ‘Master, Master, open up for us!’

<sup>12</sup> “But he answering, said, ‘Truly, I say to you, I do not know you.’

<sup>13</sup> “Watch therefore, because you do not know the day nor the hour in which the Son of Aḏam is coming,

<sup>14</sup> for it is like a man going from home, who called his own servants and delivered his possessions to them.

<sup>15</sup> “And to one he gave five talents, and to another two, and to another one, to each according to his own ability, and went from home.

<sup>16</sup> “And he who had received the five talents went and worked with them, and made another five talents.

<sup>17</sup> “In the same way, he with the two also, he gained two more.

<sup>18</sup> “But he who had received the one went away and dug in the ground, and hid the silver of his master.

<sup>19</sup> “And after a long time the master of those servants came and settled accounts with them.

<sup>20</sup> “And he who had received five talents came and brought five other talents, saying, ‘Master, you delivered to me five talents. See, I have gained five more talents besides them.’

<sup>21</sup> “And his master said to him, ‘Well done, good and trustworthy servant. You were trustworthy over a little, I shall set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master.’

<sup>22</sup> “Then he who had received two talents came and said, ‘Master, you delivered to me two talents. See, I have gained two more talents besides them.’

<sup>23</sup> “His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and trustworthy servant. You were trustworthy over a little, I shall set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master.’

<sup>24</sup> “And the one who had received the one talent also came and said, ‘Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you have not sown, and gathering where you have not scattered seed,

<sup>25</sup> and being afraid, I went and hid your talent in the ground. See, you have what is yours.’

<sup>26</sup> “And his master answering, said to him, ‘You wicked and lazy servant, you knew that I reap where I have not sown, and gather where I have not scattered seed.

<sup>27</sup> ‘Then you should have put my silver with the bankers, and at my coming I would have received back my own with interest.

<sup>28</sup> ‘Therefore take away the talent from him, and give it to him who possesses ten talents.

<sup>29</sup> ‘For to everyone who possesses, more shall be given, and he shall have overflowingly; but from him who does not possess, even what he possesses shall be taken away.

<sup>30</sup> ‘And throw the worthless servant out into the outer darkness – there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’

<sup>31</sup> “And when the Son of Aḏam comes in His esteem, and all the set-apart messengers with Him, then He shall sit on the throne of His esteem.

<sup>32</sup> “And all the nations shall be gathered before Him, and He shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd separates his sheep from the goats.

<sup>33</sup> “And He shall set the sheep on His right hand, but the goats on the left.

<sup>34</sup> “Then the Sovereign shall say to those on His right hand, ‘Come, you blessed of My Father, inherit the reign prepared for you from the foundation of the world –

<sup>35</sup> for I was hungry and you gave Me food, I was thirsty and you gave Me drink, I was a stranger and you took Me in,

<sup>36</sup> was naked and you clothed Me, I was sick and you visited Me, I was in prison and you came to Me.’

<sup>37</sup> “Then the righteous shall answer Him, saying, ‘Master, when did we see You hungry and we fed You, or thirsty and gave You to drink?

<sup>38</sup> ‘And when did we see You a stranger and took You in, or naked and clothed You?

<sup>39</sup> ‘And when did we see You sick, or in prison, and we came to You?’

<sup>40</sup> “And the Sovereign shall answer and say to them, ‘Truly, I say to you, in so far as you did it to one of the least of these My brothers, you did it to Me.’

<sup>41</sup> “He shall then also say to those on the left hand, ‘Go away from Me, accursed ones, into the everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his messengers –

<sup>42</sup> for I was hungry and you gave Me no food, I was thirsty and you gave Me no drink,

<sup>43</sup> ‘I was a stranger and you did not take Me in, was naked and you did not clothe Me, sick and in prison and you did not visit Me.’

<sup>44</sup> “Then they also shall answer Him, saying, ‘Master, when did we see You hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not serve You?’

<sup>45</sup> “Then He shall answer them, saying, ‘Truly, I say to you, in so far as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to Me.’

<sup>46</sup> “And these shall go away into everlasting punishment, but the righteous into everlasting life.”
