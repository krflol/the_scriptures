<sup>1</sup> The book of the genealogy of יהושע Messiah, Son of Dawiḏ, Son of Aḇraham:

<sup>2</sup> Aḇraham brought forth Yitsḥaq, and Yitsḥaq brought forth Ya‛aqoḇ, and Ya‛aqoḇ brought forth Yehuḏah and his brothers.

<sup>3</sup> And Yehuḏah brought forth Perets and Zeraḥ by Tamar, and Perets brought forth Ḥetsron, and Ḥetsron brought forth Ram.

<sup>4</sup> And Ram brought forth Amminaḏaḇ, and Amminaḏaḇ brought forth Naḥshon, and Naḥshon brought forth Salmon.

<sup>5</sup> And Salmon brought forth Bo‛az by Raḥaḇ, and Bo‛az brought forth Oḇĕḏ by Ruth, and Oḇĕḏ brought forth Yishai.

<sup>6</sup> And Yishai brought forth Dawiḏ the sovereign, and Dawiḏ the sovereign brought forth Shelomoh by Uriyah’s wife.

<sup>7</sup> And Shelomoh brought forth Reḥaḇ‛am, and Reḥaḇ‛am brought forth Aḇiyah, and Aḇiyah brought forth Asa.

<sup>8</sup> And Asa brought forth Yehoshaphat, and Yehoshaphat brought forth Yoram, and Yoram brought forth Uzziyah.

<sup>9</sup> And Uzziyah brought forth Yotham, and Yotham brought forth Aḥaz, and Aḥaz brought forth Ḥizqiyahu.

<sup>10</sup> And Ḥizqiyahu brought forth Menashsheh, and Menashsheh brought forth Amon, and Amon brought forth Yoshiyahu.

<sup>11</sup> And Yoshiyahu brought forth Yeḵonyah and his brothers at the time of the exile to Baḇel.

<sup>12</sup> And after the exile to Baḇel, Yeḵonyah brought forth She’alti’ĕl, and She’alti’ĕl brought forth Zerubbaḇel.

<sup>13</sup> And Zerubbaḇel brought forth Aḇihuḏ, and Aḇihuḏ brought forth Elyaqim, and Elyaqim brought forth Azor.

<sup>14</sup> And Azor brought forth Tsaḏoq, and Tsaḏoq brought forth Aqim, and Aqim brought forth Elihuḏ.

<sup>15</sup> And Elihuḏ brought forth El‛azar, and El‛azar brought forth Mattan, and Mattan brought forth Ya‛aqoḇ.

<sup>16</sup> And Ya‛aqoḇ brought forth Yosĕph the husband of Miryam, of whom was born יהושע who is called Messiah.

<sup>17</sup> So all the generations from Aḇraham to Dawiḏ were fourteen generations, and from Dawiḏ until the exile to Baḇel were fourteen generations, and from the exile to Baḇel until the Messiah were fourteen generations.

<sup>18</sup> But the birth of יהושע Messiah was as follows: After His mother Miryam was engaged to Yosĕph, before they came together, she was found to be pregnant from the Set-apart Spirit.

<sup>19</sup> And Yosĕph her husband, being righteous, and not wishing to make a show of her, had in mind to put her away secretly.

<sup>20</sup> But while he thought about this, see, a messenger of יהוה appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Yosĕph, son of Dawiḏ, do not be afraid to take Miryam as your wife, for that which is in her was brought forth from the Set-apart Spirit.

<sup>21</sup> “And she shall give birth to a Son, and you shall call His Name יהושע for He shall save His people from their sins.”

<sup>22</sup> And all this came to be in order to fill what was spoken by יהוה through the prophet, saying,

<sup>23</sup> “See, a maiden shall conceive, and she shall give birth to a Son, and they shall call His Name Immanu’ĕl,” which translated, means, “Ĕl with us.”

<sup>24</sup> And Yosĕph, awaking from his sleep, did as the messenger of יהוה commanded him and took his wife,

<sup>25</sup> but knew her not until she gave birth to her Son, the first-born. And he called His Name יהושע.
