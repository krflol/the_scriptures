<sup>1</sup> Now after the Sabbath, toward dawn on the first day of the week, Miryam from Maḡdala and the other Miryam came to see the tomb.

<sup>2</sup> And see, there was a great earthquake, for a messenger of יהוה came down out of heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat on it.

<sup>3</sup> And his appearance was like lightning, and his garments as white as snow.

<sup>4</sup> And the guards trembled for fear of him, and became like dead men.

<sup>5</sup> And the messenger responding, said to the women, “Do not be afraid, for I know that you seek יהושע who was impaled.

<sup>6</sup> “He is not here, for He was raised, as He said. Come, see the place where the Master lay.

<sup>7</sup> “And go quickly, say to His taught ones that He was raised from the dead, and see, He is going before you to Galil. There you shall see Him. See, I have told you.”

<sup>8</sup> And they left the tomb quickly, with fear and great joy, and ran to report to His taught ones.

<sup>9</sup> And as they were going to report to His taught ones, see, יהושע met them, saying, “Greetings!” And they came and held Him by the feet and did bow to Him.

<sup>10</sup> Then יהושע said to them, “Do not be afraid. Go, report to My brothers, to go to Galil, and they shall see Me there.”

<sup>11</sup> And while they were going, see, some of the watch having gone into the city, reported to the chief priests all that took place.

<sup>12</sup> And when they came together with the elders and taken counsel, they gave enough silver to the soldiers,

<sup>13</sup> saying, “Say that His taught ones came at night and stole Him away while we slept.

<sup>14</sup> “And if this should be reported to the governor, we shall win him over and keep you out of trouble.”

<sup>15</sup> And having taken the silver they did as they were instructed. And this account was widely spread among the Yehuḏim, to this day.

<sup>16</sup> And the eleven taught ones went away into Galil, to the mountain which יהושע had appointed for them.

<sup>17</sup> And when they saw Him, they bowed to Him, but some doubted.

<sup>18</sup> And יהושע came up and spoke to them, saying, “All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth.

<sup>19</sup> “Therefore, go and make taught ones of all the nations, immersing them in the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the Set-apart Spirit,

<sup>20</sup> teaching them to guard all that I have commanded you. And see, I am with you always, until the end of the age.” Amĕn.
