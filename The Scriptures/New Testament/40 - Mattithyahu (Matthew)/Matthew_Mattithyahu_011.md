<sup>1</sup> And it came to be, when יהושע ended instructing His twelve taught ones, that He set out from there to teach and to proclaim in their cities.

<sup>2</sup> And when Yoḥanan had heard in the prison of the works of Messiah, he sent two of his taught ones

<sup>3</sup> and said to Him, “Are You the Coming One, or do we look for another?”

<sup>4</sup> And יהושע answering, said to them, “Go, report to Yoḥanan what you hear and see:

<sup>5</sup> “Blind receive sight and lame walk, lepers are cleansed and deaf hear, dead are raised up and poor are brought the Good News.

<sup>6</sup> “And blessed is he who does not stumble in Me.”

<sup>7</sup> And as these were going, יהושע began to say to the crowds concerning Yoḥanan, “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?

<sup>8</sup> “But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft garments? Look, those wearing soft garments are in the houses of sovereigns.

<sup>9</sup> “But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yea, I say to you, and more than a prophet.

<sup>10</sup> “For this is he of whom it was written, ‘See, I send My messenger before Your face, who shall prepare Your way before You.’

<sup>11</sup> “Truly, I say to you, among those born of women there has not risen one greater than Yoḥanan the Immerser, yet the least one in the reign of the heavens is greater than he.

<sup>12</sup> “And from the days of Yoḥanan the Immerser till now the reign of the heavens is violated, and the violent seize it.

<sup>13</sup> “For all the prophets and the Torah prophesied till Yoḥanan.

<sup>14</sup> “And if you wish to accept it, he is Ĕliyahu who was about to come.

<sup>15</sup> “He who has ears to hear, let him hear!

<sup>16</sup> “And to what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the market-places and calling to their companions,

<sup>17</sup> and saying, ‘We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we lamented to you, and you did not beat the breast.’

<sup>18</sup> “For Yoḥanan came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, ‘He has a demon.’

<sup>19</sup> “The Son of Aḏam came eating and drinking, and they say, ‘See, a man, a glutton and a winedrinker, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’ And wisdom was declared right by her works.”

<sup>20</sup> Then He began to reproach the cities in which most of His miracles had been done, because they did not repent:

<sup>21</sup> “Woe to you, Korazin! Woe to you, Bĕyth Tsaiḏa! Because if the miracles which were done in you had been done in Tsor and Tsiḏon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.

<sup>22</sup> “But I say to you, it shall be more bearable for Tsor and Tsiḏon in the day of judgment than for you.

<sup>23</sup> “And you, Kephar Naḥum, who were exalted to the heaven, shall be brought down to the grave! Because if the miracles which were done in you had been done in Seḏom, it would have remained until this day.

<sup>24</sup> “But I say to you that it shall be more bearable for the land of Seḏom in the day of judgment than for you.”

<sup>25</sup> At that time יהושע responding, said, “I thank You, Father, Master of the heavens and earth, because You have hidden these matters from clever and learned ones and have revealed them to babes.

<sup>26</sup> “Yea, Father, because so it was well-pleasing in Your sight.

<sup>27</sup> “All have been handed over to Me by My Father, and no one knows the Son except the Father. Nor does anyone know the Father except the Son, and he to whom the Son wishes to reveal Him.

<sup>28</sup> “Come to Me, all you who labour and are burdened, and I shall give you rest.

<sup>29</sup> “Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am meek and humble in heart, and you shall find rest for your beings.

<sup>30</sup> “For My yoke is gentle and My burden is light.”
