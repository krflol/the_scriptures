<sup>1</sup> And entering into a boat, He passed over, and came to His own city.

<sup>2</sup> And see, they were bringing to Him a paralytic lying on a bed. And יהושע, seeing their belief, said to the paralytic, “Take courage, son, your sins have been forgiven.”

<sup>3</sup> And see, some of the scribes said to themselves, “This One blasphemes!”

<sup>4</sup> And יהושע, knowing their thoughts, said, “Why do you think wicked thoughts in your hearts?

<sup>5</sup> “For which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins have been forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Arise and walk’?

<sup>6</sup> “But in order for you to know that the Son of Aḏam possesses authority on earth to forgive sins...” He then said to the paralytic, “Rise, take up your bed, and go to your house.”

<sup>7</sup> And he rose and went to his house.

<sup>8</sup> And when the crowds saw it, they marvelled and praised Elohim who had given such authority to men.

<sup>9</sup> And as יהושע passed on from there, He saw a man called Mattithyahu sitting at the tax office. And He said to him, “Follow Me.” And he rose and followed Him.

<sup>10</sup> And it came to be, as יהושע sat at the table in the house, that see, many tax collectors and sinners came and sat down with Him and His taught ones.

<sup>11</sup> And when the Pharisees saw it, they said to His taught ones, “Why does your Teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?”

<sup>12</sup> And יהושע hearing this, said to them, “Those who are strong have no need of a physician, but those who are sick.

<sup>13</sup> “But go and learn what this means, ‘I desire compassion and not offering.’ For I did not come to call the righteous to repentance, but sinners.”

<sup>14</sup> Then the taught ones of Yoḥanan came to Him, saying, “Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but Your taught ones do not fast?”

<sup>15</sup> And יהושע said to them, “Are the friends of the bridegroom able to mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days shall come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they shall fast.

<sup>16</sup> “And no one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, for the patch pulls away from the garment, and the tear is made worse.

<sup>17</sup> “Neither do they put new wine into old wineskins, or else the wineskins burst, and the wine is spilled, and the wineskins are ruined. But they put new wine into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved.”

<sup>18</sup> While He was saying all this to them, see, a ruler came and bowed down to Him, saying, “My daughter is dead by now, but come and lay Your hand on her and she shall live.”

<sup>19</sup> And יהושע rose and followed him, His taught ones too.

<sup>20</sup> And see, a woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years came from behind and touched the tzitzit of His garment.

<sup>21</sup> For she said to herself, “If I only touch His garment, I shall be healed.”

<sup>22</sup> But יהושע turned, and when He saw her He said, “Take courage, daughter, your belief has healed you.” And the woman was healed from that hour.

<sup>23</sup> And when יהושע came into the ruler’s house, and saw the flute players and the crowd making a noise,

<sup>24</sup> He said to them, “Go back, for the girl is not dead, but sleeping.” And they laughed at Him.

<sup>25</sup> But when the crowd was put outside, He went in and took her by the hand, and the girl arose.

<sup>26</sup> And this report went out into all that land.

<sup>27</sup> And as יהושע passed on from there, two blind men followed Him, crying out and saying, “Son of Dawiḏ, have compassion on us!”

<sup>28</sup> And when He came into the house, the blind men came to Him. And יהושע said to them, “Do you believe that I am able to do this?” They said to Him, “Yea, Master.”

<sup>29</sup> Then He touched their eyes, saying, “According to your belief let it be to you.”

<sup>30</sup> And their eyes were opened. And יהושע strictly ordered them, saying, “See, let no one know.”

<sup>31</sup> But when they went out, they made Him known in all that land.

<sup>32</sup> And as they were going out, see, they brought to Him a man, dumb and demon-possessed.

<sup>33</sup> And when the demon was cast out, the dumb one spoke. And the crowds marvelled, saying, “It was never seen like this in Yisra’ĕl!”

<sup>34</sup> But the Pharisees said, “He casts out demons by the ruler of the demons.”

<sup>35</sup> And יהושע went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their congregations, and proclaiming the Good News of the reign, and healing every disease and every bodily weakness among the people.

<sup>36</sup> And having seen the crowds, He was moved with compassion for them, because they were weary and scattered, as sheep having no shepherd.

<sup>37</sup> Then He said to His taught ones, “The harvest truly is great, but the workers are few.

<sup>38</sup> “Pray then that the Master of the harvest would send out workers to His harvest.”

<sup>1</sup> And entering into a boat, He passed over, and came to His own city.

<sup>2</sup> And see, they were bringing to Him a paralytic lying on a bed. And יהושע, seeing their belief, said to the paralytic, “Take courage, son, your sins have been forgiven.”
