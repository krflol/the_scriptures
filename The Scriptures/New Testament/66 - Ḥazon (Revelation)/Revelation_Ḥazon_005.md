<sup>1</sup> And I saw in the right hand of Him who sat on the throne a scroll written inside and on the back, having been sealed with seven seals.

<sup>2</sup> And I saw a strong messenger proclaiming with a loud voice, “Who is worthy to open the scroll and to loosen its seals?”

<sup>3</sup> And no one in the heaven or on the earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll, or to look at it.

<sup>4</sup> And I wept much, because no one was found worthy to open and read the scroll, or to look at it.

<sup>5</sup> And one of the elders said to me, “Do not weep. See, the Lion of the tribe of Yehuḏah, the Root of Dawiḏ, overcame to open the scroll and to loosen its seven seals.”

<sup>6</sup> And I looked and saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders a Lamb standing, as having been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of Elohim sent out into all the earth.

<sup>7</sup> And He came and took the scroll out of the right hand of Him sitting on the throne.

<sup>8</sup> And when He took the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each holding a harp, and golden bowls filled with incense, which are the prayers of the set-apart ones.

<sup>9</sup> And they sang a renewed song, saying, “You are worthy to take the scroll, and to open its seals, because You were slain, and have redeemed us to Elohim by Your blood out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation,

<sup>10</sup> and made us sovereigns and priests to our Elohim, and we shall reign upon the earth.”

<sup>11</sup> And I looked, and I heard the voice of many messengers around the throne, and the living creatures, and the elders. And the number of them was myriads of myriads, and thousands of thousands,

<sup>12</sup> saying with a loud voice, “Worthy is the Lamb having been slain to receive power and riches and wisdom, and strength and respect and esteem and blessing!”

<sup>13</sup> And every creature which is in the heaven and on the earth and under the earth and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, I heard saying, “To Him sitting on the throne, and to the Lamb, be the blessing and the respect and the esteem and the might, forever and ever!”

<sup>14</sup> And the four living creatures said, “Amĕn!” And the twenty-four elders fell down and bowed before Him who lives forever and ever.
