<sup>1</sup> After this I looked and saw a door having been opened in the heaven. And the first voice which I heard was like a trumpet speaking with me, saying, “Come up here and I shall show you what has to take place after this.”
<sup>2</sup> And immediately I came to be in the Spirit and saw a throne set in the heaven, and One sat on the throne.
<sup>3</sup> And He who sat there was like a jasper and a ruby stone in appearance. And there was a rainbow around the throne, like an emerald in appearance.
<sup>4</sup> And around the throne were twenty-four thrones, and on the thrones I saw twenty-four elders sitting, dressed in white robes. And they had crowns of gold on their heads.
<sup>5</sup> And out of the throne came lightnings, and thunders, and voices. And seven lamps of fire were burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of Elohim.
<sup>6</sup> And before the throne there was a sea of glass, like crystal. And in the midst of the throne, and around the throne, were four living creatures, covered with eyes in front and in back.
<sup>7</sup> And the first living creature was like a lion, and the second living creature like a calf, and the third living creature had a face like a man, and the fourth living creature was like a flying eagle.
<sup>8</sup> And the four living creatures, each having six wings, were covered with eyes around and within. And they do not cease, day or night, saying, “Set-apart, set-apart, set-apart, יהוה Ĕl Shaddai, who was, and who is, and who is coming!”
<sup>9</sup> And when the living creatures give esteem and respect and thanks to Him who sits on the throne, who lives forever and ever,
<sup>10</sup> the twenty-four elders fall down before Him who sits on the throne and bow before Him who lives forever and ever, and they cast their crowns before the throne, saying,
<sup>11</sup> “You are worthy, O יהוה, to receive esteem and respect and power, for You have created all, and because of Your desire they are, and were created.”
