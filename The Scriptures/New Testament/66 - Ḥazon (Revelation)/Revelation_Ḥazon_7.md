<sup>1</sup> And after this I saw four messengers standing at the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.

<sup>2</sup> And I saw another messenger coming up from the rising of the sun, holding the seal of the living Elohim. And he cried with a loud voice to the four messengers to whom it was given to harm the earth and the sea,

<sup>3</sup> saying, “Do not harm the earth, nor the sea, nor the trees until we have sealed the servants of our Elohim upon their foreheads.”

<sup>4</sup> And I heard the number of those who were sealed, one hundred and forty-four thousand, sealed out of all the tribes of the children of Yisra’ĕl:

<sup>5</sup> of the tribe of Yehuḏah twelve thousand were sealed, of the tribe of Re’uḇĕn twelve thousand were sealed, of the tribe of Gaḏ twelve thousand were sealed,

<sup>6</sup> of the tribe of Ashĕr twelve thousand were sealed, of the tribe of Naphtali twelve thousand were sealed, of the tribe of Menashsheh twelve thousand were sealed,

<sup>7</sup> of the tribe of Shim‛on twelve thousand were sealed, of the tribe of Lĕwi twelve thousand were sealed, of the tribe of Yissasḵar twelve thousand were sealed,

<sup>8</sup> of the tribe of Zeḇulun twelve thousand were sealed, of the tribe of Yosĕph twelve thousand were sealed, of the tribe of Binyamin twelve thousand were sealed.

<sup>9</sup> After this I looked and saw a great crowd which no one was able to count, out of all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, dressed in white robes, and palm branches in their hands,

<sup>10</sup> and crying out with a loud voice, saying, “Deliverance belongs to our Elohim who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!”

<sup>11</sup> And all the messengers stood around the throne and the elders and the four living creatures, and fell on their faces before the throne and worshipped Elohim,

<sup>12</sup> saying, “Amĕn! The blessing, and the esteem, and the wisdom, and the thanksgiving, and the respect, and the power, and the might, to our Elohim forever and ever. Amĕn.”

<sup>13</sup> And one of the elders responded, saying to me, “Who are these dressed in white robes, and where did they come from?”

<sup>14</sup> And I said to him, “Master, you know.” And he said to me, “These are those coming out of the great distress, having washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.

<sup>15</sup> “Because of this they are before the throne of Elohim, and serve Him day and night in His Dwelling Place. And He who sits on the throne shall spread His Tent over them.

<sup>16</sup> “They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more, neither shall the sun strike them, nor any heat,

<sup>17</sup> because the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne shall shepherd them and lead them to fountains of waters of life. And Elohim shall wipe away every tear from their eyes.”
