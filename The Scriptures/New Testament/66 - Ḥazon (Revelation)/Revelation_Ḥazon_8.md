<sup>1</sup> And when He opened the seventh seal, there came to be silence in the heaven for about half an hour.

<sup>2</sup> And I saw the seven messengers who stand before Elohim, and to them were given seven trumpets.

<sup>3</sup> And another messenger came and stood at the altar, holding a golden censer, and much incense was given to him, that he should offer it with the prayers of all the set-apart ones upon the golden altar which was before the throne.

<sup>4</sup> And the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the set-apart ones, went up before Elohim from the hand of the messenger.

<sup>5</sup> And the messenger took the censer, and filled it with fire from the altar, and threw it to the earth. And there were noises, and thunders, and lightnings, and an earthquake.

<sup>6</sup> And the seven messengers who held the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.

<sup>7</sup> And the first messenger sounded, and there came to be hail and fire mixed with blood, and they were thrown to the earth. And a third of the trees were burned up, and all green grass was burned up.

<sup>8</sup> And the second messenger sounded, and what looked like a great mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea, and a third of the sea became blood,

<sup>9</sup> and a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed.

<sup>10</sup> And the third messenger sounded, and a great star fell from the heaven, burning like a torch, and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the fountains of water,

<sup>11</sup> and the name of the star is called Wormwood. And a third of the waters became wormwood, and many men died from the waters, because they were made bitter.

<sup>12</sup> And the fourth messenger sounded, and a third of the sun was struck, and a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of them were darkened. And a third of the day did not shine, and likewise the night.

<sup>13</sup> And I looked, and I heard an eagle flying in mid-heaven, crying with a loud voice, “Woe, woe, woe to those dwelling upon the earth, because of the remaining blasts of the trumpet of the three messengers who are about to sound!”
