<sup>1</sup> And I saw another sign in the heaven, great and marvellous: seven messengers having the seven last plagues, for the wrath of Elohim was ended in them.
<sup>2</sup> And I saw like a sea of glass mixed with fire, and those overcoming the beast and his image and his mark and the number of his name, standing on the sea of glass, holding harps of Elohim.
<sup>3</sup> And they sing the song of Mosheh the servant of Elohim, and the song of the Lamb, saying, “Great and marvellous are Your works, יהוה Ĕl Shaddai! Righteous and true are Your ways, O Sovereign of the set-apart ones!
<sup>4</sup> “Who shall not fear You, O יהוה, and esteem Your Name? Because You alone are kind. Because all nations shall come and worship before You, for Your righteousnesses have been made manifest.”
<sup>5</sup> And after this I looked and saw the Dwelling Place of the Tent of Witness in the heaven was opened.
<sup>6</sup> And out of the Dwelling Place came the seven messengers having the seven plagues, dressed in clean bright linen, and having their chests girded with golden bands.
<sup>7</sup> And one of the four living creatures gave to the seven messengers seven golden bowls filled with the wrath of Elohim who lives forever and ever.
<sup>8</sup> And the Dwelling Place was filled with smoke from the esteem of Elohim and from His power, and no one was able to enter the Dwelling Place until the seven plagues of the seven messengers were ended.
