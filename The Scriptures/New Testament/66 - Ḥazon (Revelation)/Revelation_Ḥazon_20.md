<sup>1</sup> And I saw a messenger coming down from the heaven, having the key to the pit of the deep and a great chain in his hand.

<sup>2</sup> And he seized the dragon, the serpent of old, who is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years,

<sup>3</sup> and he threw him into the pit of the deep, and shut him up, and set a seal on him, so that he should lead the nations no more astray until the thousand years were ended. And after that he has to be released for a little while.

<sup>4</sup> And I saw thrones – and they sat on them, and judgment was given to them – and the lives of those who had been beheaded because of the witness they bore to יהושע and because of the Word of Elohim, and who did not worship the beast, nor his image, and did not receive his mark upon their foreheads or upon their hands. And they lived and reigned with Messiah for a thousand years

<sup>5</sup> (and the rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended) – this is the first resurrection.

<sup>6</sup> Blessed and set-apart is the one having part in the first resurrection. The second death possesses no authority over these, but they shall be priests of Elohim and of Messiah, and shall reign with Him a thousand years.

<sup>7</sup> And when the thousand years have ended, Satan shall be released from his prison,

<sup>8</sup> and he shall go out to lead the nations astray which are in the four corners of the earth, Goḡ and Maḡoḡ, to gather them together for battle, whose number is as the sand of the sea.

<sup>9</sup> And they came up over the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of the set-apart ones and the beloved city. And fire came down from Elohim out of the heaven and consumed them.

<sup>10</sup> And the devil, who led them astray, was thrown into the lake of fire and sulphur where the beast and the false prophet are. And they shall be tortured day and night forever and ever.

<sup>11</sup> And I saw a great white throne and Him who was sitting on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away, and no place was found for them.

<sup>12</sup> And I saw the dead, small and great, standing before the throne, and books were opened. And another book was opened, which is the Book of Life. And the dead were judged from what was written in the books, according to their works.

<sup>13</sup> And the sea gave up the dead who were in it, and death and the grave gave up the dead who were in them. And they were judged, each one according to his works.

<sup>14</sup> And the death and the grave were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death.

<sup>15</sup> And if anyone was not found written in the Book of Life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.
