<sup>1</sup> And I saw another strong messenger coming down from the heaven, robed in a cloud, and a rainbow on his head, and his face was like the sun, and his feet like columns of fire,

<sup>2</sup> and having in his hand a little book opened. And he placed his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land,

<sup>3</sup> and cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roars. And when he cried out, seven thunders spoke their sounds.

<sup>4</sup> And when the seven thunders spoke their sounds, I was about to write, but I heard a voice from the heaven saying to me, “Seal up what the seven thunders spoke, and do not write them.”

<sup>5</sup> And the messenger whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land lifted up his right hand to the heaven,

<sup>6</sup> and swore by Him who lives forever and ever, who created the heaven and what is in it, the earth and what is in it, and the sea and what is in it, that there shall be no further delay,

<sup>7</sup> but in the days of the sounding of the seventh messenger, when he is about to sound, the secret of Elohim shall also be ended, as He declared to His servants the prophets.

<sup>8</sup> And the voice which I heard out of the heaven spoke to me again and said, “Go, take the little book which is opened in the hand of the messenger standing on the sea and on the earth.”

<sup>9</sup> And I went to the messenger and said to him, “Give me the little book.” And he said to me, “Take and eat it, and it shall make your stomach bitter, but it shall be as sweet as honey in your mouth.”

<sup>10</sup> And I took the little book out of the messenger’s hand and ate it, and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth, but when I had eaten it, my stomach was made bitter.

<sup>11</sup> And he said to me, “You have to prophesy again concerning many peoples and nations and tongues and sovereigns.”
