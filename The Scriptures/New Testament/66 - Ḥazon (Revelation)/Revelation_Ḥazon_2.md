<sup>2</sup> “I know your works, and your labour, and your endurance, and that you are not able to bear evil ones, and have tried those who say they are emissaries and are not, and have found them false;

<sup>3</sup> and you have been bearing up and have endurance, and have laboured for My Name’s sake and have not become weary.

<sup>4</sup> “But I hold this against you, that you have left your first love.

<sup>5</sup> “So remember from where you have fallen, and repent and do the first works, or else I shall come to you speedily and remove your lampstand from its place, unless you repent.

<sup>6</sup> “Yet this you have, that you hate the works of the Nikolaites, which I also hate.

<sup>7</sup> “He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies. To him who overcomes I shall give to eat from the tree of life, which is in the midst of the Paradise of Elohim.” ’

<sup>9</sup> “I know your works, and pressure, and poverty – yet you are rich – and the blasphemy of those who say they are Yehuḏim and are not, but are a congregation of Satan.

<sup>10</sup> “Do not be afraid of what you are about to suffer. See, the devil is about to throw some of you into prison, in order to try you, and you shall have pressure ten days. Be trustworthy until death, and I shall give you the crown of life.

<sup>13</sup> “I know your works, and where you dwell, where the throne of Satan is. And you hold fast to My Name, and did not deny the belief in Me, even in the days in which Antipas was My trustworthy witness, who was killed near you, where Satan dwells.

<sup>14</sup> “But I hold a few matters against you, because you have there those who adhere to the teaching of Bil‛am, who taught Balaq to put a stumbling-block before the children of Yisra’ĕl, to eat food offered to idols, and to commit whoring.

<sup>15</sup> “So you also have those who adhere to the teaching of the Nikolaites, which teaching I hate.

<sup>16</sup> “Repent, or else I shall come to you speedily and fight against them with the sword of My mouth.

<sup>17</sup> “He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies. To him who overcomes I shall give some of the hidden manna to eat. And I shall give him a white stone, and on the stone a renewed Name written which no one knows except him who receives it.” ’
