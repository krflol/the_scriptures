<sup>1</sup> And he showed me a river of water of life, clear as crystal, coming from the throne of Elohim and of the Lamb.

<sup>2</sup> In the middle of its street, and on either side of the river, was the tree of life, which bore twelve fruits, each tree yielding its fruit every month. And the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.

<sup>3</sup> And no longer shall there be any curse, and the throne of Elohim and of the Lamb shall be in it, and His servants shall serve Him.

<sup>4</sup> And they shall see His face, and His Name shall be upon their foreheads.

<sup>5</sup> And night shall be no more, and they shall have no need of a lamp or the light of the sun, because יהוה Elohim shall give them light. And they shall reign forever and ever.

<sup>6</sup> And he said to me, “These words are trustworthy and true. And יהוה Elohim of the set-apart prophets has sent His messenger to show His servants what has to take place with speed.

<sup>7</sup> “See, I am coming speedily! Blessed is he who guards the words of the prophecy of this book.”

<sup>8</sup> And I, Yoḥanan, saw and heard these matters. And when I heard and saw, I fell down to worship before the feet of the messenger who showed me these matters.

<sup>9</sup> And he said to me, “See, do not! For I am your fellow servant, and of your brothers the prophets, and of those who are guarding the words of this book. Worship Elohim.”

<sup>10</sup> And he said to me, “Do not seal the words of the prophecy of this book, because the time is near.

<sup>11</sup> “He who does wrong, let him do more wrong; he who is filthy, let him be more filthy; he who is righteous, let him be more righteous; he who is set-apart, let him be more set-apart.

<sup>12</sup> “And see, I am coming speedily, and My reward is with Me, to give to each according to his work.

<sup>13</sup> “I am the ‘Aleph’ and the ‘Taw’, the Beginning and the End, the First and the Last.

<sup>14</sup> “Blessed are those doing His commands, so that the authority shall be theirs unto the tree of life, and to enter through the gates into the city.

<sup>15</sup> “But outside are the dogs and those who enchant with drugs, and those who whore, and the murderers, and the idolaters, and all who love and do falsehood.

<sup>16</sup> “I, יהושע, have sent My messenger to witness to you these matters in the assemblies. I am the Root and the Offspring of Dawiḏ, the Bright and Morning Star.”

<sup>17</sup> And the Spirit and the bride say, “Come!” And he who hears, let him say, “Come!” And he who thirsts, come! And he who desires it, take the water of life without paying!

<sup>18</sup> For I witness to everyone hearing the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds to them, Elohim shall add to him the plagues that are written in this book,

<sup>19</sup> and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, Elohim shall take away his part from the Book of Life, and out of the set-apart city, which are written in this Book.

<sup>20</sup> He that bears witness of these matters says, “Yes, I am coming speedily.” Amĕn. Yes, come, Master יהושע !

<sup>21</sup> The favour of our Master יהושע Messiah be with the set-apart ones. Amĕn.
