<sup>1</sup> And I stood on the sand of the sea. And I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his horns ten crowns, and on his heads names of blasphemy.

<sup>2</sup> And the beast I saw was like a leopard, and his feet were like the feet of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. And the dragon gave him his power, and his throne, and great authority.

<sup>3</sup> And I saw one of his heads, as having been slain to death, and his deadly wound was healed. And all the earth marvelled after the beast.

<sup>4</sup> And they worshipped the dragon who gave authority to the beast. And they worshipped the beast, saying, “Who is like the beast? Who is able to fight with him?”

<sup>5</sup> And he was given a mouth speaking great matters and blasphemies, and he was given authority to do so forty-two months.

<sup>6</sup> And he opened his mouth in blasphemies against Elohim, to blaspheme His Name, and His Tent, and those dwelling in the heaven.

<sup>7</sup> And it was given to him to fight with the set-apart ones and to overcome them. And authority was given to him over every tribe and tongue and nation.

<sup>8</sup> And all those dwelling on the earth, whose names have not been written in the Book of Life of the slain Lamb, from the foundation of the world shall worship him.

<sup>9</sup> If anyone has an ear, let him hear.

<sup>10</sup> He who brings into captivity shall go into captivity, he who kills with the sword has to be killed with the sword. Here is the endurance and the belief of the set-apart ones.

<sup>11</sup> And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth, and he had two horns like a lamb and spoke like a dragon.

<sup>12</sup> And he exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence, and causes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.

<sup>13</sup> And he does great signs, so that he even makes fire come down from the heaven on the earth before men.

<sup>14</sup> And he leads astray those dwelling on the earth because of those signs which he was given to do before the beast, saying to those dwelling on the earth to make an image to the beast who was wounded by the sword, yet lived.

<sup>15</sup> And there was given to him to give spirit to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak and cause to be killed as many as would not worship the image of the beast.

<sup>16</sup> And he causes all, both small and great, and rich and poor, and free and slave, to be given a mark upon their right hand or upon their foreheads,

<sup>17</sup> and that no one should be able to buy or sell except he that has the mark or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.

<sup>18</sup> Here is the wisdom! He who has understanding, let him calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man, and his number is 666.
