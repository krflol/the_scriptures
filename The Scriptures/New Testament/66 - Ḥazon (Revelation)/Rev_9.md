<sup>1</sup> And the fifth messenger sounded, and I saw a star from the heaven which had fallen to the earth. And the key to the pit of the deep was given to it.
<sup>2</sup> And he opened the pit of the deep, and smoke went up out of the pit like the smoke of a great furnace. And the sun was darkened, also the air, because of the smoke of the pit.
<sup>3</sup> And out of the smoke locusts came upon the earth, and authority was given to them as the scorpions of the earth possess authority.
<sup>4</sup> And it was said to them that they shall not harm the grass of the earth, or any green matter, or any tree, but only those men who do not have the seal of Elohim upon their foreheads.
<sup>5</sup> And it was given to them that they should not kill them, but to torture them for five months. And their torture was like the torture of a scorpion when it stings a man.
<sup>6</sup> And in those days men shall seek death and shall not find it. And they shall long to die, but death shall flee from them.
<sup>7</sup> And the locusts looked like horses prepared for battle, and on their heads were crowns like gold, and their faces were like the faces of men.
<sup>8</sup> And they had hair like women’s hair, and their teeth were like lions’ teeth.
<sup>9</sup> And they had breastplates like breastplates of iron, and the sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots of many horses running into battle.
<sup>10</sup> And they have tails like scorpions, and stings. And in their tails is their authority to harm men five months.
<sup>11</sup> And they have over them a sovereign, the messenger of the pit of the deep, whose name in Heḇrew is Abaddon, but in Greek he has the name Apolluon.
<sup>12</sup> The first woe is past. See, two woes are still coming after this.
<sup>13</sup> And the sixth messenger sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before Elohim,
<sup>14</sup> saying to the sixth messenger who had the trumpet, “Release the four messengers, those having been bound at the great river Euphrates.”
<sup>15</sup> And the four messengers, those having been prepared for the hour and day and month and year, were released to kill a third of mankind.
<sup>16</sup> And the number of the armies of the horsemen was two hundred million, and I heard the number of them.
<sup>17</sup> And this is how I saw the horses in the vision and those who sat on them, having breastplates of fiery red, and hyacinth blue, and sulphur yellow. And the heads of the horses were like the heads of lions, and out of their mouths came fire, and smoke, and sulphur.
<sup>18</sup> A third of mankind was killed by these three plagues, by the fire and the smoke and the sulphur which came out of their mouths.
<sup>19</sup> For the authority of the horses is in their mouth and in their tails, for their tails are like serpents, having heads. And with them they do harm.
<sup>20</sup> And the rest of mankind, who were not killed by these plagues, did not repent of the works of their hands, that they should not worship the demons, and idols of gold, and of silver, and of brass, and of stone, and of wood, which are neither able to see, nor to hear, nor to walk.
<sup>21</sup> And they did not repent of their murders, nor of their drug sorceries, nor of their whoring, nor of their thefts.
