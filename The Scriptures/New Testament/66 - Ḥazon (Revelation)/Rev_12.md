<sup>1</sup> And a great sign was seen in the heaven: a woman clad with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars.
<sup>2</sup> And being pregnant, she cried out in labour and in pain to give birth.
<sup>3</sup> And another sign was seen in the heaven: and see, a great, fiery red dragon having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns on his heads.
<sup>4</sup> And his tail draws a third of the stars of the heaven and throws them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, to devour her child as soon as it was born.
<sup>5</sup> And she bore a male child who was to shepherd all nations with a rod of iron. And her child was caught away to Elohim and to His throne.
<sup>6</sup> And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by Elohim, to be nourished there one thousand two hundred and sixty days.
<sup>7</sup> And there came to be fighting in the heaven: Miḵa’ĕl and his messengers fought against the dragon. And the dragon and his messengers fought,
<sup>8</sup> but they were not strong enough, nor was a place found for them in the heaven any longer.
<sup>9</sup> And the great dragon was thrown out, that serpent of old, called the Devil and Satan, who leads all the world astray. He was thrown to the earth, and his messengers were thrown out with him.
<sup>10</sup> And I heard a loud voice saying in the heaven, “Now have come the deliverance and the power and the reign of our Elohim, and the authority of His Messiah, for the accuser of our brothers, who accused them before our Elohim day and night, has been thrown down.
<sup>11</sup> “And they overcame him because of the Blood of the Lamb, and because of the Word of their witness, and they did not love their lives to the death.
<sup>12</sup> “Because of this rejoice, O heavens, and you who dwell in them! Woe to the earth and the sea, because the devil has come down to you, having great wrath, knowing that he has little time.”
<sup>13</sup> And when the dragon saw that he had been thrown to the earth, he persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male child.
<sup>14</sup> And the woman was given two wings of a great eagle, to fly into the wilderness to her place, where she is nourished for a time and times and half a time, from the presence of the serpent.
<sup>15</sup> And out of his mouth the serpent spewed water like a river after the woman, to cause her to be swept away by the river.
<sup>16</sup> And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed up the river which the dragon had spewed out of his mouth.
<sup>17</sup> And the dragon was enraged with the woman, and he went to fight with the remnant of her seed, those guarding the commands of Elohim and possessing the witness of יהושע Messiah.
