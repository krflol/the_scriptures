<sup>1</sup> Revelation of יהושע Messiah, which Elohim gave Him to show His servants what has to take place with speed. And He signified it by sending His messenger to His servant Yoḥanan,

<sup>2</sup> who bore witness to the Word of Elohim, and the witness of יהושע Messiah – to all he saw.

<sup>3</sup> Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of this prophecy, and guard what is written in it, for the time is near.

<sup>4</sup> Yoḥanan, to the seven assemblies that are in Asia: Favour to you and peace from Him who is and who was and who is coming, and from the seven Spirits that are before His throne,

<sup>5</sup> and from יהושע Messiah, the trustworthy witness, the first-born from the dead, and the ruler of the sovereigns of the earth. To Him who loved us and washed us from our sins in His own blood,

<sup>6</sup> and has made us sovereigns and priests to His Elohim and Father, to Him be esteem and rule forever and ever. Amĕn.

<sup>7</sup> See, He is coming with the clouds, and every eye shall see Him, even they who pierced Him. And all the tribes of the earth shall mourn because of Him. Yes, Amĕn.

<sup>8</sup> “I am the ‘Aleph’ and the ‘Taw’, Beginning and End,” says יהוה “who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.”

<sup>9</sup> I, Yoḥanan, both your brother and co-sharer in pressure, and in the reign and endurance of יהושע Messiah, came to be on the island that is called Patmos for the Word of Elohim and for the witness of יהושע Messiah.

<sup>10</sup> I came to be in the Spirit on the Day of יהוה, and I heard behind me a loud voice, as of a trumpet,

<sup>11</sup> saying, “I am the ‘Aleph’ and the ‘Taw’, the First and the Last,” and, “Write in a book what you see and send it to the seven assemblies of Asia – to Ephesos, and to Smurna, and to Pergamos, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodikeia.”

<sup>12</sup> And I turned to see the voice which spoke with me. And having turned, I saw seven golden lampstands,

<sup>13</sup> and in the midst of the seven lampstands One like the Son of Aḏam, dressed in a robe down to the feet and girded about the chest with a golden band.

<sup>14</sup> And His head and hair were white as white wool, as snow, and His eyes as a flame of fire,

<sup>15</sup> and His feet like burnished brass, as if refined in a furnace, and His voice as the sound of many waters.

<sup>16</sup> And in His right hand He held seven stars, and out of His mouth went a sharp two-edged sword, and His face was as the sun shining in its strength.

<sup>17</sup> And when I saw Him, I fell at His feet as dead, and He placed His right hand on me, saying, “Do not be afraid, I am the First and the Last,

<sup>18</sup> and the living One. And I became dead, and see, I am living forever and ever. Amĕn. And I possess the keys of the grave and of death.

<sup>19</sup> “Write therefore what you have seen, both what is now and what shall take place after these:

<sup>20</sup> “The secret of the seven stars which you saw in My right hand, and the seven golden lampstands: The seven stars are messengers of the seven assemblies, and the seven lampstands which you saw are seven assemblies.
