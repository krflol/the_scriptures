<sup>1</sup> And one of the seven messengers who had the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying to me, “Come, I shall show you the judgment of the great whore sitting on many waters,
<sup>2</sup> with whom the sovereigns of the earth committed whoring, and the inhabitants of the earth were made drunk with the wine of her whoring.”
<sup>3</sup> And he carried me away in the Spirit into the wilderness. And I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast covered with names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.
<sup>4</sup> And the woman was dressed in purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls, holding in her hand a golden cup filled with abominations and the filthiness of her whoring,
<sup>5</sup> and upon her forehead a name written, a secret: BAḆEL THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF THE WHORES AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.
<sup>6</sup> And I saw the woman, drunk with the blood of the set-apart ones, and with the blood of the witnesses of יהושע. And having seen her, I marvelled – greatly marvelled!
<sup>7</sup> And the messenger said to me, “Why did you marvel? Let me explain to you the secret of the woman and of the beast she rides, which has the seven heads and the ten horns.
<sup>8</sup> “The beast that you saw was, and is not, and is about to come up out of the pit of the deep and goes to destruction. And those dwelling on the earth, whose names are not written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world, shall marvel when they see the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.
<sup>9</sup> “Here is the mind having wisdom: The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sits.
<sup>10</sup> “And there are seven sovereigns: five have fallen, and one is, and the other has not yet come. And when he comes, he has to remain a little while.
<sup>11</sup> “And the beast that was, and is not, is himself also the eighth, and is of the seven, and goes to destruction.
<sup>12</sup> “And the ten horns which you saw are ten sovereigns who have not yet received a reign, but receive authority as sovereigns with the beast for one hour.
<sup>13</sup> “They have one mind, and they shall give their power and authority to the beast.
<sup>14</sup> “They shall fight with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them, for He is Master of masters and Sovereign of sovereigns. And those with Him are called, and chosen, and trustworthy.”
<sup>15</sup> And he said to me, “The waters which you saw, where the whore sits, are peoples, and crowds, and nations, and tongues.
<sup>16</sup> “And the ten horns which you saw on the beast, these shall hate the whore, and lay her waste and naked, and eat her flesh and burn her with fire.
<sup>17</sup> “For Elohim did give it into their hearts to do His mind, to be of one mind, and to give their reign to the beast, until the words of Elohim shall be accomplished.
<sup>18</sup> “And the woman whom you saw is that great city having sovereignty over the sovereigns of the earth.”
