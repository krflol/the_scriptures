<sup>1</sup> And I heard a loud voice from the Dwelling Place saying to the seven messengers, “Go and pour out the bowls of the wrath of Elohim on the earth.”

<sup>2</sup> And the first went and poured out his bowl upon the earth, and an evil and wicked sore came upon the men, those having the mark of the beast and those worshipping his image.

<sup>3</sup> And the second messenger poured out his bowl on the sea, and it became blood, as of a dead one, and every living creature in the sea died.

<sup>4</sup> And the third messenger poured out his bowl on the rivers and fountains of water, and they became blood.

<sup>5</sup> And I heard the messenger of the waters saying, “You are righteous, O יהוה, the One who is and who was and who shall be, because You have judged these.

<sup>6</sup> “Because they have shed the blood of set-apart ones and prophets, and You have given them blood to drink. For they deserve it.”

<sup>7</sup> And I heard another out of the altar saying, “Yes, יהוה Ĕl Shaddai, true and righteous are Your judgments.”

<sup>8</sup> And the fourth messenger poured out his bowl on the sun, and it was given to him to burn men with fire.

<sup>9</sup> And men were burned with great heat, and they blasphemed the Name of Elohim who possesses authority over these plagues. And they did not repent, to give Him esteem.

<sup>10</sup> And the fifth messenger poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and his reign became darkened. And they gnawed their tongues from pain.

<sup>11</sup> And they blasphemed the Elohim of the heaven for their pains and their sores, and did not repent of their works.

<sup>12</sup> And the sixth messenger poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up, in order to prepare the way of the sovereigns from the east.

<sup>13</sup> And I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits, as frogs,

<sup>14</sup> for they are spirits of demons, doing signs, which go out to the sovereigns of the entire world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of יהוה the Almighty.

<sup>15</sup> “See, I am coming as a thief. Blessed is he who is staying awake and guarding his garments, lest he walk naked and they see his shame.”

<sup>16</sup> And they gathered them together to the place called in Heḇrew, Har Meḡiddo.

<sup>17</sup> And the seventh messenger poured out his bowl into the air, and a loud voice came out of the Dwelling Place of the heaven, from the throne, saying, “It is done!”

<sup>18</sup> And there came to be noises and thunders and lightnings. And there came to be a great earthquake, such a mighty and great earthquake as had not came to be since men were on the earth.

<sup>19</sup> And the great city became divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. And great Baḇel was remembered before Elohim, to give her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of His wrath.

<sup>20</sup> And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.

<sup>21</sup> And great hail from the heaven fell upon men, every hailstone about the weight of a talent. And men blasphemed Elohim for the plague of the hail, because that plague was exceedingly great.
