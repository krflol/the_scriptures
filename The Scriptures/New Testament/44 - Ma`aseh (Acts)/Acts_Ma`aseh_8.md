<sup>1</sup> And Sha’ul was giving approval to his death. And on that day there was a great persecution against the assembly which was at Yerushalayim, and they were all scattered throughout the countries of Yehuḏah and Shomeron, except the emissaries.

<sup>2</sup> And dedicated men buried Stephanos, and made great lamentation over him.

<sup>3</sup> But Sha’ul was ravaging the assembly, entering every house, and dragging off men and women, putting them in prison.

<sup>4</sup> Then those who had been scattered went everywhere bringing the Good News: the Word!

<sup>5</sup> And going down to the city of Shomeron Philip proclaimed Messiah to them.

<sup>6</sup> And the crowds with one mind heeded what Philip said, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.

<sup>7</sup> For unclean spirits came out of many who were possessed, crying with a loud voice, and many who were paralysed and lame were healed.

<sup>8</sup> And there came to be great joy in that city.

<sup>9</sup> Now there was a certain man called Shim‛on, who formerly was practising magic in the city and astonishing the people of Shomeron, claiming to be someone great,

<sup>10</sup> to whom they all were giving heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, “This one is the power of Elohim, which is great.”

<sup>11</sup> And they were giving heed to him because for a long time he had amazed them with his magic.

<sup>12</sup> And when they believed Philip as he brought the Good News about the reign of Elohim and the Name of יהושע Messiah, both men and women were immersed.

<sup>13</sup> And Shim‛on himself also believed. And when he was immersed he continued with Philip, and was amazed, seeing the miracles and signs which took place.

<sup>14</sup> And when the emissaries who were at Yerushalayim heard that Shomeron had received the Word of Elohim, they sent Kĕpha and Yoḥanan to them,

<sup>15</sup> who, when they had come down, prayed for them to receive the Set-apart Spirit,

<sup>16</sup> for He had not yet fallen on any of them, but they had only been immersed in the Name of the Master יהושע.

<sup>17</sup> Then they laid hands on them, and they received the Set-apart Spirit.

<sup>18</sup> And Shim‛on, seeing that through the laying on of the hands of the emissaries the Set-apart Spirit was given, he offered them money,

<sup>19</sup> saying, “Give me this authority too, so that anyone I lay hands on shall receive the Set-apart Spirit.”

<sup>20</sup> But Kĕpha said to him, “Let your silver perish with you, because you thought to buy the gift of Elohim through money!

<sup>21</sup> “You have neither part nor lot in this matter, for your heart is not right before Elohim.

<sup>22</sup> “Repent therefore of this evil of yours, and plead with Elohim to forgive you the intention of your heart.

<sup>23</sup> “For I see that you are poisoned by bitterness and bound by unrighteousness.”

<sup>24</sup> But Shim‛on answering, said, “Plead with the Master for me, so that none of what you had said shall come upon me.”

<sup>25</sup> Then after they had earnestly witnessed and spoken the Word of יהוה, they returned to Yerushalayim, bringing the Good News in many villages of the Shomeronites.

<sup>26</sup> But a messenger of יהוה spoke to Philip, saying, “Arise and go toward the south along the way which goes down from Yerushalayim to Azzah.” This is desert.

<sup>27</sup> And he arose and went, and saw, a man of Kush, a eunuch of great authority under Kandake the sovereigness of the Kushites, who was in charge of all her treasury, and had come to Yerushalayim to worship,

<sup>28</sup> and was returning. And sitting in his chariot, he was reading the prophet Yeshayahu.

<sup>29</sup> And the Spirit said to Philip, “Go near and join him in that chariot.”

<sup>30</sup> And running up, Philip heard him reading the prophet Yeshayahu, and said, “Do you know what you are reading?”

<sup>31</sup> And he said, “How am I able, unless someone guides me?” And he called Philip near, to come up and sit with him.

<sup>32</sup> And the passage of the Scripture which he was reading was this, “He was led as a sheep to slaughter, and like a lamb silent before its shearer, so He opened not His mouth.

<sup>33</sup> “In His humiliation He was deprived of right-ruling. And who shall declare His generation? Because His life was taken from the earth.”

<sup>34</sup> And the eunuch, answering Philip, said, “I ask you, about whom does the prophet say this, about himself or about some other?”

<sup>35</sup> And Philip opening his mouth, and beginning at this Scripture, brought to him the Good News: יהושע !

<sup>36</sup> And as they were going on the way, they came to some water. And the eunuch said, “Look, water! What hinders me from being immersed?”

<sup>37</sup> And Philip said, “If you believe with all your heart, it is permitted.” And he answering, said, “I believe that יהושע Messiah is the Son of Elohim.”

<sup>38</sup> And he commanded the chariot to stand still. And both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water, and he immersed him.

<sup>39</sup> And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of יהוה caught Philip away, and the eunuch saw him no more, for he went his way, rejoicing.

<sup>40</sup> Philip, however, was found at Ashdoḏ. And passing through, he brought the Good News in all the cities until he came to Caesarea.
