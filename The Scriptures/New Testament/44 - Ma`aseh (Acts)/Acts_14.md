<sup>1</sup> And it came to be in Ikonion that they went together into the congregation of the Yehuḏim, and spoke in such a way that a great number of both Yehuḏim and Greeks believed.
<sup>2</sup> But the Yehuḏim who would not obey stirred up the gentiles and evilly influenced their beings against the brothers.
<sup>3</sup> So they remained a long time, speaking boldly in the Master, who was bearing witness to the word of His favour, giving signs and wonders to be done by their hands.
<sup>4</sup> And the crowd of the city was divided, and some sided with the Yehuḏim, and some with the emissaries.
<sup>5</sup> But when a move took place by both the gentiles and Yehuḏim, with their rulers, to mistreat and stone them,
<sup>6</sup> they became aware of it and fled to Lustra and Derbe, cities of Lukaonia, and the country round about.
<sup>7</sup> And they were bringing the Good News there.
<sup>8</sup> And in Lustra there was sitting a certain man, disabled in his feet, a cripple from his mother’s womb, who had never walked.
<sup>9</sup> This one heard Sha’ul speaking, who, looking intently at him and seeing that he had belief to be healed,
<sup>10</sup> said with a loud voice, “Stand upright on your feet!” And he sprang up and began to walk.
<sup>11</sup> And when the crowds saw what Sha’ul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in Lukaonian, “The mighty ones have become like men and come down to us!”
<sup>12</sup> And they called Barnaḇah Zeus, and Sha’ul Hermes, since he was the chief speaker.
<sup>13</sup> And the priest of Zeus, being in front of their city, brought oxen and wreaths to the gates, and wished to offer with the crowds.
<sup>14</sup> And when the emissaries Barnaḇah and Sha’ul heard this, they tore their garments and ran in among the crowd, crying out
<sup>15</sup> and saying, “Men, why are you doing this? We also are men with the same nature as you, bringing to you the Good News: to turn from these worthless matters to the living Elohim, who made the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and all that is in them,
<sup>16</sup> who in past generations allowed all the nations to walk in their own ways,
<sup>17</sup> though, indeed, He did not leave Himself without witness, doing good – giving us rain from heaven and fruit-bearing seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.”
<sup>18</sup> Even with these words they still had difficulty in stopping the crowds from offering to them.
<sup>19</sup> But Yehuḏim arrived from Antioch and Ikonion, and having won over the crowds, they stoned Sha’ul, dragged him out of the city, thinking he was dead.
<sup>20</sup> But while the taught ones gathered around him, he rose up and went into the city. And on the next day he went away with Barnaḇah to Derbe.
<sup>21</sup> And having brought the Good News to that city, and having made many taught ones, they returned to Lustra, and Ikonion, and Antioch,
<sup>22</sup> strengthening the beings of the taught ones, encouraging them to continue in the belief, and that through many pressures we have to enter the reign of Elohim.
<sup>23</sup> And having appointed elders in every assembly, having prayed with fasting, they committed them to the Master in whom they had believed.
<sup>24</sup> And having passed through Pisidia, they came to Pamphulia.
<sup>25</sup> And having spoken the word in Perge, they went down to Attaleia,
<sup>26</sup> and from there they sailed to Antioch, where they had been committed to the favour of Elohim for the work which they had completed.
<sup>27</sup> And having arrived, and having gathered together the assembly, they related all that Elohim had done with them, and that He had opened the door of belief to the gentiles.
<sup>28</sup> And they remained there a long time with the taught ones.
