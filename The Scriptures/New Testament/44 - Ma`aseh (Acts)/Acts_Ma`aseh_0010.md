<sup>1</sup> Now there was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a captain of what was called the Italian Regiment,

<sup>2</sup> dedicated, and fearing Elohim with all his household, doing many kind deeds to the people, and praying to Elohim always.

<sup>3</sup> He clearly saw in a vision, about the ninth hour of the day, a messenger of Elohim coming to him, and saying to him, “Cornelius!”

<sup>4</sup> And looking intently at him, and becoming afraid, he said, “What is it, master?” And he said to him, “Your prayers and your kind deeds have come up for a remembrance before Elohim.

<sup>5</sup> “And now send men to Yapho, and send for Shim‛on who is also called Kĕpha.

<sup>6</sup> “He is staying with Shim‛on, a leather-tanner, whose house is by the sea.”

<sup>7</sup> And when the messenger who spoke to him went away, Cornelius called two of his household servants, and a dedicated soldier from among those who waited on him continually.

<sup>8</sup> And having explained to them all, he sent them to Yapho.

<sup>9</sup> And on the next day, as they were on their way and approaching the city, Kĕpha went up on the house-top to pray, about the sixth hour.

<sup>10</sup> And he became hungry and wished to eat. But while they were preparing, he fell into a trance,

<sup>11</sup> and he saw the heaven opened and a certain vessel like a great sheet bound at the four corners, descending to him and let down to the earth,

<sup>12</sup> in which were all kinds of four-footed beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping creatures, and the birds of the heaven.

<sup>13</sup> And a voice came to him, “Rise up, Kĕpha, slay and eat.”

<sup>14</sup> But Kĕpha said, “Not at all, Master! Because I have never eaten whatever is common or unclean.”

<sup>15</sup> And a voice came to him again the second time, “What Elohim has cleansed you do not consider common.”

<sup>16</sup> And this took place three times, and the vessel was taken back to the heaven.

<sup>17</sup> And while Kĕpha was doubting within himself about what the vision might mean, look, the men who had been sent from Cornelius, having asked for the house of Shim‛on, stood at the gate,

<sup>18</sup> and calling out, they enquired whether Shim‛on, also known as Kĕpha, was staying there.

<sup>19</sup> And as Kĕpha was thinking about the vision, the Spirit said to him, “See, three men seek you.

<sup>20</sup> “But rise up, go down and go with them, not doubting at all, for I have sent them.”

<sup>21</sup> So Kĕpha went down to the men who had been sent to him from Cornelius, and said, “Look, I am the one you seek. Why have you come?”

<sup>22</sup> And they said, “Cornelius the captain, a righteous man and one who fears Elohim and well spoken of by the entire nation of the Yehuḏim, was instructed by a set-apart messenger to send for you to his house, and to hear words from you.”

<sup>23</sup> So inviting them in, he housed them. And on the next day Kĕpha went away with them, and some brothers from Yapho went with him.

<sup>24</sup> And the following day they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius was waiting for them, having called together his relatives and close friends.

<sup>25</sup> And it came to be, that when Kĕpha entered, Cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and bowed before him.

<sup>26</sup> But Kĕpha raised him up, saying, “Stand up, I myself am also a man.”

<sup>27</sup> And talking with him, he went in and found many who had come together.

<sup>28</sup> And he said to them, “You know that a Yehuḏite man is not allowed to associate with, or go to one of another race. But Elohim has shown me that I should not call any man common or unclean.

<sup>29</sup> “That is why I came without hesitation when I was sent for. So I ask, why have you sent for me?”

<sup>30</sup> And Cornelius said, “Four days ago I was fasting until this hour. And at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and see, a man stood before me in shining garments,

<sup>31</sup> and said, ‘Cornelius, your prayer has been heard, and your kind deeds were remembered before Elohim.

<sup>32</sup> ‘Now send to Yapho and call Shim‛on here, who is also called Kĕpha. He is staying in the house of Shim‛on, a leather-tanner, by the sea. When he comes, he shall speak to you.’

<sup>33</sup> “So I sent to you immediately, and you have done well to come. And now, we are all present before Elohim, to hear all that you have been commanded by Elohim.”

<sup>34</sup> And opening his mouth, Kĕpha said, “Truly I see that Elohim shows no partiality,

<sup>35</sup> but in every nation, he who fears Him and works righteousness is accepted by Him.

<sup>36</sup> “He sent the word to the children of Yisra’ĕl, bringing the Good News: peace through יהושע Messiah! He is Master of all.

<sup>37</sup> “You know what word came to be throughout all Yehuḏah, beginning from Galil after the immersion which Yoḥanan proclaimed:

<sup>38</sup> how Elohim did anoint יהושע of Natsareth with the Set-apart Spirit and with power, who went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for Elohim was with Him.

<sup>39</sup> “And we are witnesses of all He did, both in the country of the Yehuḏim and in Yerushalayim, whom they even killed by hanging on a timber.

<sup>40</sup> “Elohim raised up this One on the third day, and let Him be seen,

<sup>41</sup> not to all the people, but to witnesses, those having been chosen before by Elohim – to us who ate and drank with Him after He arose from the dead.

<sup>42</sup> “And He commanded us to proclaim to the people, and to witness that it is He who was appointed by Elohim to be Judge of the living and the dead.

<sup>43</sup> “To this One all the prophets bear witness, that through His Name, everyone believing in Him does receive forgiveness of sins.”

<sup>44</sup> While Kĕpha was still speaking these words, the Set-apart Spirit fell upon all those hearing the word.

<sup>45</sup> And those of the circumcision who believed were astonished, as many as came with Kĕpha, because the gift of the Set-apart Spirit had been poured out on the gentiles also,

<sup>46</sup> for they were hearing them speaking with tongues and extolling Elohim. Then Kĕpha answered,

<sup>47</sup> “Is anyone able to forbid water, that these should not be immersed who have received the Set-apart Spirit – even as also we?”

<sup>48</sup> And he commanded them to be immersed in the Name of יהושע Messiah. Then they asked him to remain a few days.
