<sup>1</sup> And in those days, when the taught ones were increasing, there arose a grumbling against the Heḇrews by the Hellenists, because their widows were overlooked in the daily serving.

<sup>2</sup> So the twelve summoned the group of the taught ones and said, “It is not pleasing for us to leave the Word of Elohim and serve tables.

<sup>3</sup> “Therefore, brothers, seek out from among you seven men who are known to be filled with the Set-apart Spirit and wisdom, whom we shall appoint for this duty,

<sup>4</sup> but we shall give ourselves continually to prayer and to serving the Word.”

<sup>5</sup> And the word pleased the entire group. And they chose Stephanos, a man filled with belief and the Set-apart Spirit, and Philip, and Prochoros, and Nikanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nikolaos, a convert from Antioch,

<sup>6</sup> whom they set before the emissaries. And when they had prayed, they laid hands on them.

<sup>7</sup> And the Word of Elohim spread, and the number of the taught ones increased greatly in Yerushalayim, and a great many of the priests were obedient to the belief.

<sup>8</sup> And Stephanos, filled with belief and power, did great wonders and signs among the people.

<sup>9</sup> But some of those of the so-called Congregation of the Freedmen (Cyrenians, Alexandrians, and those from Kilikia and Asia), rose up, disputing with Stephanos,

<sup>10</sup> but they were unable to resist the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spoke.

<sup>11</sup> Then they instigated men to say, “We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Mosheh and Elohim.”

<sup>12</sup> And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, so they came upon him, seized him, and brought him to the council.

<sup>13</sup> And they set up false witnesses who said, “This man does not cease to speak blasphemous words against this set-apart place and the Torah,

<sup>14</sup> for we have heard him saying that this יהושע of Natsareth shall overthrow this place and change the institutes which Mosheh delivered unto us.”

<sup>15</sup> And all who sat in the council, looking steadily at him, saw his face was like the face of a heavenly messenger.
