<sup>1</sup> And the emissaries and brothers who were in Yehuḏah heard that the gentiles also received the word of Elohim.

<sup>2</sup> And when Kĕpha went up to Yerushalayim, those of the circumcision were contending with him,

<sup>3</sup> saying, “You went in to uncircumcised men and ate with them!”

<sup>4</sup> But Kĕpha began and set it forth in order, saying:

<sup>5</sup> “I was in the city of Yapho praying. And in a trance I saw a vision, a certain vessel descending like a great sheet, let down from the heaven by four corners, and it came to me.

<sup>6</sup> “Having looked into it, I perceived and I saw four-footed beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping creatures, and the birds of heaven.

<sup>7</sup> “And I heard a voice saying to me, ‘Rise up, Kĕpha, slay and eat.’

<sup>8</sup> “But I said, ‘Not at all, Master! Because whatever is common or unclean has never entered into my mouth.’

<sup>9</sup> “And the voice answered me again from the heaven, ‘What Elohim has cleansed you do not consider common.’

<sup>10</sup> “And this took place three times, and all were drawn up again into the heaven.

<sup>11</sup> “And see, immediately three men stood before the house where I was, having been sent to me from Caesarea.

<sup>12</sup> “And the Spirit said to me to go with them, not doubting at all. And these six brothers also went with me, and we went into the man’s house.

<sup>13</sup> “And he told us how he had seen a messenger standing in his house, who said to him, ‘Send men to Yapho, and call for Shim‛on who is also called Kĕpha,

<sup>14</sup> who shall speak to you words, by which you shall be saved, you and all your house.’

<sup>15</sup> “And as I began to speak, the Set-apart Spirit fell upon them, as upon us at the beginning.

<sup>16</sup> “And I remembered the word of the Master, how He said, ‘Yoḥanan indeed immersed in water, but you shall be immersed in the Set-apart Spirit.’

<sup>17</sup> “So if Elohim gave them the same gift as He gave us when we believed on the Master יהושע Messiah, how was I able to withstand Elohim?”

<sup>18</sup> And having heard this, they were silent, and praised Elohim, saying, “Then Elohim has indeed also given to the gentiles repentance to life.”

<sup>19</sup> Then, indeed, they who were scattered because of the pressure that arose over Stephanos passed through to Phoenicia, and Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except the Yehuḏim only.

<sup>20</sup> But some of them were men from Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they had come to Antioch, spoke to the Hellenists, bringing the Good News: the Master יהושע !

<sup>21</sup> And the hand of the Master was with them, and a great number having believed turned to the Master.

<sup>22</sup> And word of it came to the ears of the assembly in Yerushalayim, and they sent out Barnaḇah to go as far as Antioch,

<sup>23</sup> who, having come, and seeing the favour of Elohim, was glad, and encouraged them all with purpose of heart to cleave to the Master.

<sup>24</sup> Because he was a good man, and filled with the Set-apart Spirit and with belief. And large numbers were added to the Master.

<sup>25</sup> Then Barnaḇah went to Tarsos to seek Sha’ul,

<sup>26</sup> and having found him, he brought him to Antioch. And it came to be that for an entire year they came together in the assembly and taught large numbers. And the taught ones were called ‘Messianites’ first in Antioch.

<sup>27</sup> And in those days prophets came from Yerushalayim to Antioch.

<sup>28</sup> And one of them, named Ḥaḡaḇ, stood up and indicated by the Spirit that there was going to be a great scarcity of food over all the world – which also took place under Claudius Caesar.

<sup>29</sup> So the taught ones, each according to his ability, decided to send relief to the brothers dwelling in Yehuḏah.

<sup>30</sup> This they also did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnaḇah and Sha’ul.
