<sup>1</sup> And certain men came down from Yehuḏah and were teaching the brothers, “Unless you are circumcised, according to the practice of Mosheh, you are unable to be saved.”
<sup>2</sup> So when Sha’ul and Barnaḇah had no small dissension and dispute with them, they arranged for Sha’ul and Barnaḇah and certain others of them to go up to Yerushalayim, to the emissaries and elders, about this question.
<sup>3</sup> So, being sent on their way by the assembly, they passed through Phoenicia and Shomeron, relating the conversion of the gentiles. And they were causing great joy to all the brothers.
<sup>4</sup> And having arrived in Yerushalayim, they were received by the assembly and the emissaries and the elders. And they reported all that Elohim had done with them.
<sup>5</sup> And some of the believers who belonged to the sect of the Pharisees, rose up, saying, “It is necessary to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the Torah of Mosheh.”
<sup>6</sup> And the emissaries and elders came together to look into this matter.
<sup>7</sup> And when there had been much dispute, Kĕpha rose up and said to them, “Men, brothers, you know that a good while ago Elohim chose among us, that by my mouth the gentiles should hear the word of the Good News and believe.
<sup>8</sup> “And Elohim, who knows the heart, bore witness to them, by giving them the Set-apart Spirit, as also to us,
<sup>9</sup> and made no distinction between us and them, cleansing their hearts by belief.
<sup>10</sup> “Now then, why do you try Elohim by putting a yoke on the neck of the taught ones which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?
<sup>11</sup> “But through the favour of the Master יהושע Messiah we trust to be saved, in the same way as they.”
<sup>12</sup> And all the crowd was silent and were listening to Barnaḇah and Sha’ul declaring how many miracles and wonders Elohim did among the gentiles, through them.
<sup>13</sup> And after they were silent, Ya‛aqoḇ answered, saying, “Men, brothers, listen to me:
<sup>14</sup> “Shim‛on has declared how Elohim first visited the gentiles to take out of them a people for His Name.
<sup>15</sup> “And the words of the prophets agree with this, as it has been written:
<sup>16</sup> ‘After this I shall return and rebuild the Booth of Dawiḏ which has fallen down. And I shall rebuild its ruins, and I shall set it up,
<sup>17</sup> so that the remnant of mankind shall seek יהוה, even all the gentiles on whom My Name has been called, says יהוה who is doing all this,’
<sup>18</sup> who has made this known from of old.
<sup>19</sup> “Therefore I judge that we should not trouble those from among the gentiles who are turning to Elohim,
<sup>20</sup> but that we write to them to abstain from the defilements of idols, and from whoring, and from what is strangled, and from blood.
<sup>21</sup> “For from ancient generations Mosheh has, in every city, those proclaiming him – being read in the congregations every Sabbath.”
<sup>22</sup> Then it seemed good to the emissaries and elders, with all the assembly, to send chosen men from among them to Antioch with Sha’ul and Barnaḇah: Yehuḏah being called Barsabba, and Sila, leading men among the brothers,
<sup>23</sup> having written by their hand this: The emissaries and the elders and the brothers, To the brothers who are of the gentiles in Antioch, and Syria, and Kilikia: Greetings.
<sup>24</sup> Since we have heard that some who went out from us have troubled you with words, unsettling your lives, to whom we gave no command –
<sup>25</sup> it seemed good to us, having become of one mind, to send chosen men to you with our beloved Barnaḇah and Sha’ul,
<sup>26</sup> men who have given up their lives for the Name of our Master יהושע Messiah.
<sup>27</sup> We have therefore sent Yehuḏah and Sila, who are also confirming this by word of mouth.
<sup>28</sup> For it seemed good to the Set-apart Spirit, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessities:
<sup>29</sup> that you abstain from what is offered to idols, and blood, and what is strangled, and whoring. If you keep yourselves from these, you shall do well. Be strong!
<sup>30</sup> They, therefore, being sent off, went to Antioch. And having gathered the crowd together, they delivered the letter.
<sup>31</sup> And having read it, they rejoiced over its encouragement.
<sup>32</sup> And Yehuḏah and Sila, being themselves also prophets, encouraged the brothers with many words and strengthened them.
<sup>33</sup> And having spent some time, they were sent back in peace from the brothers to the emissaries.
<sup>34</sup> But it seemed good to Sila to remain.
<sup>35</sup> And Sha’ul and Barnaḇah continued in Antioch, teaching and bringing, with many others also, the Good News: the Word of יהוה !
<sup>36</sup> And after some days Sha’ul said to Barnaḇah, “Let us now go back and visit our brothers in every city where we proclaimed the Word of יהוה, and see how they are.”
<sup>37</sup> And Barnaḇah purposed to take with them Yoḥanan called Mark.
<sup>38</sup> But Sha’ul thought it not fit to take with them the one who withdrew from them in Pamphulia, and had not gone with them to the work.
<sup>39</sup> A sharp feeling therefore came to be, so that they parted from one another. And so Barnaḇah took Mark and sailed to Cyprus.
<sup>40</sup> And Sha’ul chose Sila and went off, being committed by the brothers to the favour of Elohim.
<sup>41</sup> And he went through Syria and Kilikia, strengthening the assemblies.
