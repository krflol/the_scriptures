<sup>1</sup> And Kĕpha and Yoḥanan were going up to the Set-apart Place at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour.
<sup>2</sup> And a certain man, lame from his birth, was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the Set-apart Place which is called Yaphah, to ask alms from those entering into the Set-apart Place,
<sup>3</sup> who, seeing Kĕpha and Yoḥanan about to go into the Set-apart Place, asked for alms.
<sup>4</sup> And Kĕpha, with Yoḥanan, looking steadfastly at him, said, “Look at us.”
<sup>5</sup> And he gave heed to them, expecting to receive whatever from them.
<sup>6</sup> But Kĕpha said, “I do not have silver and gold, but what I do possess, this I give you: In the Name of יהושע Messiah of Natsareth, rise up and walk.”
<sup>7</sup> And taking him by the right hand he lifted him up, and immediately his feet and ankle bones were made firm.
<sup>8</sup> And leaping up, he stood and walked, and went in with them into the Set-apart Place, walking and leaping and praising Elohim.
<sup>9</sup> And all the people saw him walking and praising Elohim.
<sup>10</sup> And they recognised him, that it was he who sat begging alms at the Lovely Gate of the Set-apart Place. And they were filled with wonder and amazement at what befell him.
<sup>11</sup> And as the lame man who was healed was clinging to Kĕpha and Yoḥanan, all the people ran together to them in the porch which is called Shelomoh’s, greatly amazed.
<sup>12</sup> And seeing it, Kĕpha responded to the people, “Men of Yisra’ĕl, why do you marvel at this? Or why look so intently at us, as though by our own power or reverence we have made him walk?
<sup>13</sup> “The Elohim of Aḇraham, and of Yitsḥaq, and of Ya‛aqoḇ, the Elohim of our fathers, esteemed His Servant יהושע, whom you delivered up and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he had decided to release Him.
<sup>14</sup> “But you denied the Set-apart and Righteous One, and asked that a man, a murderer, be granted you.
<sup>15</sup> “But you killed the Leader of life, whom Elohim raised from the dead, of which we are witnesses.
<sup>16</sup> “And by the belief in His Name, this one whom you see and know, His Name made strong, and the belief which comes through Him has given him this perfect healing before all of you.
<sup>17</sup> “And now, brothers, I know that you did it in ignorance, as your rulers did too.
<sup>18</sup> “But this is how Elohim has filled what He had announced beforehand through the mouth of all the prophets, that His Messiah was to suffer.
<sup>19</sup> “Repent therefore and turn back, for the blotting out of your sins, in order that times of refreshing might come from the presence of the Master,
<sup>20</sup> and that He sends יהושע Messiah, pre-appointed for you,
<sup>21</sup> whom heaven needs to receive until the times of restoration of all matters, of which Elohim spoke through the mouth of all His set-apart prophets since of old.
<sup>22</sup> “For Mosheh truly said to the fathers, ‘ יהוה your Elohim shall raise up for you a Prophet like me from your brothers. Him you shall hear according to all matters, whatever He says to you.
<sup>23</sup> ‘And it shall be that every being who does not hear that Prophet shall be utterly destroyed from among the people.’
<sup>24</sup> “And likewise, all the prophets who have spoken, from Shemu’ĕl and those following, have also announced these days.
<sup>25</sup> “You are sons of the prophets, and of the covenant which Elohim made with our fathers, saying to Aḇraham, ‘And in your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed.’
<sup>26</sup> “To you first, Elohim, having raised up His Servant יהושע, sent Him to bless you, in turning away each one of you from your wicked ways.”
