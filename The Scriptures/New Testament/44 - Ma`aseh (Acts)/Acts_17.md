<sup>1</sup> And having passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonike, where there was a congregation of the Yehuḏim.
<sup>2</sup> And according to his practice, Sha’ul went in unto them, and for three Sabbaths was reasoning with them from the Scriptures,
<sup>3</sup> explaining and pointing out that the Messiah had to suffer and rise again from the dead, and saying, “This is the Messiah, יהושע, whom I proclaim to you.”
<sup>4</sup> And some of them did believe, and a large number of the worshipping Greeks, and not a few of the leading women, joined Sha’ul and Sila.
<sup>5</sup> But the Yehuḏim who did not believe, having become envious, took some of the wicked men from the market-place, and gathering a mob, set all the city in an uproar and came upon the house of Jason, and were seeking to bring them out to the people.
<sup>6</sup> But not finding them, they dragged Jason and some of the brothers to the city rulers, crying out, “They who have turned the world upside down have come here too,
<sup>7</sup> whom Jason has received. And all of them are acting contrary to the dogmas of Caesar, saying there is another sovereign, יהושע.”
<sup>8</sup> And they troubled the crowd and the city rulers when they heard this.
<sup>9</sup> And when they had received a pledge from Jason and the rest, they let them go.
<sup>10</sup> And the brothers immediately sent Sha’ul and Sila away by night to Beroia, who, having come, went into the congregation of the Yehuḏim.
<sup>11</sup> Now these were more noble than those in Thessalonike, who received the word with great eagerness, and searched the Scriptures daily, if these words were so.
<sup>12</sup> Then many of them truly believed, and also not a few of the Greeks, decent women as well as men.
<sup>13</sup> And when the Yehuḏim from Thessalonike came to know that the word of Elohim was proclaimed by Sha’ul at Beroia, they came there also and stirred up the crowds.
<sup>14</sup> And then immediately the brothers sent Sha’ul away, to go to the sea, but both Sila and Timothy stayed there.
<sup>15</sup> And those who arranged for Sha’ul brought him to Athens. And receiving a command for Sila and Timothy to join him as soon as possible, they departed.
<sup>16</sup> But while Sha’ul was waiting for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred up within him when he saw that the city was utterly idolatrous.
<sup>17</sup> Therefore, indeed, he was reasoning in the congregation with the Yehuḏim and with the gentile worshippers, and in the market-place daily with those who met there.
<sup>18</sup> And some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers encountered him. And some were saying, “What does this babbler wish to say?” Others said, “He seems to be a proclaimer of strange mighty ones” – because to them he brought the Good News: יהושע and the resurrection!
<sup>19</sup> So they laid hold of him and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, “Are we able to know what this fresh teaching is of which you speak?
<sup>20</sup> “For you are bringing some strange matters to our ears. We wish, then, to know what these mean.”
<sup>21</sup> For all the Athenians and the strangers living there spent their leisure time in doing naught but to speak or to hear what is fresh.
<sup>22</sup> And having stood in the midst of the Areopagus Sha’ul said, “Men of Athens, I see that you are very religious in every matter.
<sup>23</sup> “For passing through and observing the objects of your worship, I even found an altar with this inscription: TO THE UNKNOWN MIGHTY ONE. Not knowing then whom you worship, I make Him known to you:
<sup>24</sup> “ יהוה, who made the world and all that is in it, this One being Master of heaven and earth, does not dwell in dwellings made with hands.
<sup>25</sup> “Nor is He served with men’s hands – as if needing any – Himself giving to all life, and breath, and all else.
<sup>26</sup> “And He has made from one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, having ordained beforehand the times and the boundaries of their dwelling,
<sup>27</sup> to seek the Master, if at least they would reach out for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us.
<sup>28</sup> “For in Him we live and move and are, as also some of your own poets have said, ‘For we are also His offspring.’
<sup>29</sup> “Now then, since we are the offspring of Elohim, we should not think that the Elohim is like gold or silver or stone, an image made by the skill and thought of man.
<sup>30</sup> “Truly, then, having overlooked these times of ignorance, Elohim now commands all men everywhere to repent,
<sup>31</sup> because He has set a day on which He is going to judge the world in righteousness by a Man whom He has appointed, having given proof of this to all by raising Him from the dead.”
<sup>32</sup> And hearing of the resurrection of the dead, some indeed mocked, while others said, “We shall hear you again concerning this.”
<sup>33</sup> And so Sha’ul went out from among them.
<sup>34</sup> But some men joined him and believed, among them Dionusios the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.
