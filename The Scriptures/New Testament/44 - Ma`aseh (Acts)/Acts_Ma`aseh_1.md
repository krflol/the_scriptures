<sup>1</sup> The first account I made, O Theophilos, of all that יהושע began both to do and to teach,

<sup>2</sup> until the day when He was taken up, after giving instructions through the Set-apart Spirit to the emissaries whom He had chosen,

<sup>3</sup> to whom He also presented Himself alive after His suffering by many infallible proofs, being seen by them for forty days, speaking concerning the reign of Elohim.

<sup>4</sup> And meeting with them, He commanded them not to leave Yerushalayim, but to wait for the Promise of the Father, “which you have heard from Me –

<sup>5</sup> because Yoḥanan truly immersed in water, but you shall be immersed in the Set-apart Spirit not many days from now.”

<sup>6</sup> So when they had come together, they asked Him, saying, “Master, would You at this time restore the reign to Yisra’ĕl?”

<sup>7</sup> And He said to them, “It is not for you to know times or seasons which the Father has put in His own authority.

<sup>8</sup> “But you shall receive power when the Set-apart Spirit has come upon you, and you shall be My witnesses in Yerushalayim, and in all Yehuḏah and Shomeron, and to the end of the earth.”

<sup>9</sup> And having said this, while they were looking on, He was taken up, and a cloud hid Him from their sight.

<sup>10</sup> And as they were gazing into the heaven as He went up, see, two men stood by them dressed in white,

<sup>11</sup> who also said, “Men of Galil, why do you stand looking up into the heaven? This same יהושע, who was taken up from you into the heaven, shall come in the same way as you saw Him go into the heaven.”

<sup>12</sup> Then they went back to Yerushalayim from the Mount of Olives, which is near Yerushalayim, a Sabbath day’s journey.

<sup>13</sup> And when they came in, they went up into the upper room where they were staying: both Kĕpha and Ya‛aqoḇ and Yoḥanan and Andri, Philip and T’oma, Bartholomi and Mattithyahu, Ya‛aqoḇ the son of Alphai and Shim‛on the Zealot, and Yehuḏah the son of Ya‛aqoḇ.

<sup>14</sup> All these were continuing with one mind in prayer and supplication, with the women and Miryam the mother of יהושע, and with His brothers.

<sup>15</sup> And in those days Kĕpha, standing up in the midst of the taught ones – and there was a gathering of about a hundred and twenty – said,

<sup>16</sup> “Men and brothers, this Scripture had to be filled which the Set-apart Spirit spoke before by the mouth of Dawiḏ concerning Yehuḏah, who became a guide to those who seized יהושע,

<sup>17</sup> because he was numbered with us and did receive his share in this service.”

<sup>18</sup> (This one, therefore, purchased a field with the wages of unrighteousness, and falling forward, he burst open in the middle and all his intestines gushed out.

<sup>19</sup> And it became known to all those dwelling in Yerushalayim, so that in their own language that field was called, Ḥaqal Dema, that is, Field of Blood).

<sup>20</sup> “For it has been written in the Book of Psalms, ‘Let his dwelling lie waste, and let no one live in it,’ and, ‘Let another take his office.’

<sup>21</sup> “It is therefore necessary that of the men who have been with us all the time that the Master יהושע went in and out among us,

<sup>22</sup> beginning from the immersion of Yoḥanan to that day when He was taken up from us, that one of these should become a witness with us of His resurrection.”

<sup>23</sup> And they put forward two: Yosĕph called Barsabba, who was also called Justus, and Mattithyahu.

<sup>24</sup> And praying they said, “You, יהוה, who know the hearts of all, show which one of these two You have chosen

<sup>25</sup> to receive the share in this service and office of the emissary from which Yehuḏah by transgression fell, to go to his own place.”

<sup>26</sup> And they cast their lots, and the lot fell on Mattithyahu. And he was numbered with the eleven emissaries.
