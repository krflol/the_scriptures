<sup>1</sup> And about that time Herodes the sovereign put forth his hands to do evil to some from the assembly.
<sup>2</sup> And he killed Ya‛aqoḇ the brother of Yoḥanan with the sword.
<sup>3</sup> And seeing that it was pleasing to the Yehuḏim, he proceeded further to arrest Kĕpha as well – and they were the Days of Unleavened Bread.
<sup>4</sup> So when he had seized him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four squads of soldiers to watch over him, intending to bring him before the people after Passover.
<sup>5</sup> So Kĕpha was indeed kept in prison, but prayer was earnestly made to Elohim on his behalf by the assembly.
<sup>6</sup> And when Herodes was about to bring him out, that night Kĕpha was sleeping, bound with two chains between two soldiers. And the guards before the door were keeping the prison.
<sup>7</sup> And see, a messenger of יהוה stood by, and a light shone in the building. And smiting the side of Kĕpha he raised him up, saying, “Get up quickly!” And his chains fell off his hands.
<sup>8</sup> And the messenger said to him, “Gird yourself and bind on your sandals,” and he did so. And he said to him, “Put on your garment and follow me.”
<sup>9</sup> And coming out he followed him, and knew not that what was done by the messenger was true, but thought he was seeing a vision.
<sup>10</sup> And when they had passed the first and the second guard posts, they came to the iron gate that leads to the city, which opened to them by itself. And they went out and went down one street, and the messenger instantly withdrew from him.
<sup>11</sup> And when Kĕpha had come to himself, he said, “Now I truly know that יהוה has sent His messenger, and delivered me from the hand of Herodes and from all the Yehuḏite people were anticipating.”
<sup>12</sup> And having realised this, he went to the house of Miryam, the mother of Yoḥanan who was also called Mark, where many had gathered to pray.
<sup>13</sup> And when Kĕpha knocked at the door of the gate, a girl named Rhode came to answer.
<sup>14</sup> And when she recognised Kĕpha’s voice, she did not open the gate because of her joy, but ran in and reported that Kĕpha stood before the gate.
<sup>15</sup> And they said to her, “You are mad!” But she kept insisting that it was so, and they said, “It is his messenger.”
<sup>16</sup> And Kĕpha continued knocking, and having opened they saw him and were amazed.
<sup>17</sup> And motioning to them with his hand to be silent, he told them how the Master brought him out of the prison. And he said, “Report this to Ya‛aqoḇ and to the brothers.” And he left and went to another place.
<sup>18</sup> Now when day came, there was no small stir among the soldiers about what had become of Kĕpha.
<sup>19</sup> And when Herodes had searched for him and did not find him, he examined the guards and ordered them to be led away. And he went down from Yehuḏah to Caesarea, and stayed there.
<sup>20</sup> Now Herodes had been highly displeased with the people of Tsor and Tsiḏon, but with one mind they came to him, and having made Blastos the sovereign’s eunuch their friend, they were asking for peace, because their country was supplied with food by the sovereign’s country.
<sup>21</sup> And on an appointed day Herodes, having put on his royal clothes, sat on his throne and gave an address to them.
<sup>22</sup> And the people kept shouting, “The voice of a mighty one and not of a man!”
<sup>23</sup> And instantly a messenger of יהוה smote him, because he did not give the esteem to Elohim. And becoming worm-eaten, he died.
<sup>24</sup> And the word of Elohim went on growing and spreading.
<sup>25</sup> And Barnaḇah and Sha’ul returned from Yerushalayim, having completed the service, and having taken with them Yoḥanan who was also called Mark.
