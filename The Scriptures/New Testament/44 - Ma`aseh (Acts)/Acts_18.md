<sup>1</sup> And after this Sha’ul left Athens and went to Corinth.
<sup>2</sup> And he found a certain Yehuḏite named Aqulas, born in Pontos, who had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla – because Claudius had commanded all the Yehuḏim to leave Rome – and he came to them.
<sup>3</sup> And because he was of the same trade, he stayed with them and was working, for they were tentmakers by trade.
<sup>4</sup> And he was reasoning in the congregation every Sabbath, and won over both Yehuḏim and Greeks.
<sup>5</sup> And when Sila and Timothy came down from Makedonia, Sha’ul was pressed by the Spirit, and earnestly witnessed to the Yehuḏim that יהושע is the Messiah.
<sup>6</sup> However, when they resisted and blasphemed, he shook his garments and said to them, “Your blood is upon your head, I am clean. From now on I shall go to the gentiles.”
<sup>7</sup> And having left there he came to the house of a certain man named Justus, who worshipped Elohim, whose house was next to the congregation.
<sup>8</sup> And Crispus, the ruler of the congregation, did believe in the Master with all his household. And many of the Corinthians, hearing, believed and were immersed.
<sup>9</sup> And the Master spoke to Sha’ul in the night by a vision, “Do not be afraid, but speak, and do not be silent,
<sup>10</sup> because I am with you, and no one shall attack you to do you evil, because I have much people in this city.”
<sup>11</sup> And he remained a year and six months, teaching the Word of יהוה among them.
<sup>12</sup> And when Gallion was proconsul of Achaia, the Yehuḏim with one mind rose up against Sha’ul and brought him to the judgment seat,
<sup>13</sup> saying, “This one does seduce men to worship Elohim contrary to the Torah.”
<sup>14</sup> And as Sha’ul was about to open his mouth, Gallion said to the Yehuḏim, “If it were a matter of wrongdoing or wicked recklessness, O Yehuḏim, there would be reason why I should bear with you.
<sup>15</sup> “But if it is a question of words and names and a law which is among you, see to it yourselves, for I do not wish to be a judge of these matters.”
<sup>16</sup> And he drove them away from the judgment seat.
<sup>17</sup> And all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the ruler of the congregation, and beat him before the judgment seat. But Gallion showed no concern whatever.
<sup>18</sup> And Sha’ul, having stayed several days more, having taken leave of the brothers, was sailing for Syria, and Priscilla and Aqulas were with him, having shaved his hair at Kenḥrea, for he had taken a vow.
<sup>19</sup> And he came to Ephesos, and left them there, but he himself went into the congregation and reasoned with the Yehuḏim.
<sup>20</sup> And when they asked him to stay a longer time with them, he declined,
<sup>21</sup> but took leave of them, saying, “I have to keep this coming festival in Yerushalayim by all means, but I shall come back to you, Elohim desiring so.” And he sailed from Ephesos.
<sup>22</sup> And having come to Caesarea, going up and greeting the assembly, he went down to Antioch.
<sup>23</sup> And having spent some time there, he went forth, passing through the country of Galatia and on through Phrygia, strengthening all the taught ones.
<sup>24</sup> And a certain Yehuḏite named Apollos, born at Alexandria, a learned man and mighty in the Scriptures, came to Ephesos.
<sup>25</sup> This one had been instructed in the way of the Master. And being fervent in spirit, he was speaking and teaching the matters about the Master exactly, though he knew only the immersion of Yoḥanan.
<sup>26</sup> And he began to speak boldly in the congregation. And when Aqulas and Priscilla heard him, they took him aside and explained to him the way of Elohim more exactly.
<sup>27</sup> And when he intended to pass through to Achaia, the brothers, having encouraged him, wrote to the taught ones to receive him, who, having arrived, greatly helped those who believed through favour,
<sup>28</sup> for with power he refuted the Yehuḏim publicly, showing from the Scriptures that יהושע is the Messiah.
